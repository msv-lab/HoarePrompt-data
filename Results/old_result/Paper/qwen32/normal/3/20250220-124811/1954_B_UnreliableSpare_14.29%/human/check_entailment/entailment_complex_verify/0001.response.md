### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's delve deeper into the reasoning to confirm the correctness of the assessment:

1. **Uniform Array Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies if the array is uniform (all elements are the same) and outputs `-1` in this case. This is consistent with the problem description, as a uniform array will remain beautiful regardless of how many elements are removed.

2. **Finding Minimum Sequence Length:**
   - The program attempts to find the minimum length of contiguous subsequences of the same element. However, this approach is flawed. The minimum length of such a subsequence does not directly translate to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.
   - For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the shortest contiguous subsequence is `[5]` (length 1). Removing `[5]` does not make the array non-beautiful because the remaining array `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` is still beautiful.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals:**
   - The logic in the program does not consider the overall structure of the array and the positions of different elements. The problem requires identifying the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beautiful property, which involves more complex reasoning than simply finding the shortest subsequence.

### Correctness of the Program:

Given the identified issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used to determine the minimum number of removals is flawed. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
