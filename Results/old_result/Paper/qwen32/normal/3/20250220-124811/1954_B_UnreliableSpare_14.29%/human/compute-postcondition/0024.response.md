Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `flag` is True if `arr[0] == arr[1] == ... == arr[n-1]`, otherwise `flag` is False; `val` is `arr[0]`; `i` is 0; if `arr[i]` equals `val`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is Decimal('Infinity'); otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0.**
