You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It determines if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds and prints the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements that are the same in `arr`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Initialization and Basic Checks:**
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same using a `flag`. If all elements are the same, it outputs `-1` (which is correct according to the problem statement).
   - However, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.

2. **Counting Consecutive Elements:**
   - The program then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same (`cnt`), and keeps track of the minimum count of such consecutive elements (`ans`).
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the structure of the array and the specific operation allowed (replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`).

3. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removal:**
   - The program calculates `ans` as the minimum count of consecutive elements, but this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property.
   - For example, consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`:
     - The program will calculate `ans` as `3` (the count of consecutive `3`s).
     - However, to make the array stop being beautiful, we need to remove three `3`s (the first three or the last three), not just the middle `5`.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the input:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
The correct output should be `3` (remove the first three `3`s or the last three `3`s). However, the program will output `3` but for the wrong reason and might fail on other cases.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the longest subarray where the "beautiful" property holds and then determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break this subarray. This involves more complex logic than simply counting consecutive elements.

Thus, the given program is incorrect for some cases, and the Correctness is **False**.
