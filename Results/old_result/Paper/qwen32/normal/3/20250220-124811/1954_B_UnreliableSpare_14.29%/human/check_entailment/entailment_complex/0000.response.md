### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

**Problem Statement Recap:**
- An array is called "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i - 1} \).
- The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. If it's impossible, output -1.
- The array is guaranteed to be beautiful.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Uniform:**
   - The program initializes `flag` to `True` and iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same. If it finds any differing element, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `flag` remains `True` after the loop, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it prints `-1` because removing any element would still leave the array beautiful.

3. **Finding Minimum Sequence Length:**
   - If the array is not uniform, the program initializes `ans` to infinity and `val` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements equal to `val`. When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the count of the consecutive sequence.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to account for the last sequence.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`, which is the length of the shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements in the array.

**Correctness:**

- **Case 1: Uniform Array**
  - If the array is uniform (all elements are the same), the program correctly identifies this and outputs `-1` as expected.
  
- **Case 2: Non-Uniform Array**
  - If the array is non-uniform, the program correctly identifies the shortest sequence of consecutive equal elements and outputs its length as the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles arrays of length 1 correctly by outputting `-1` since a single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
