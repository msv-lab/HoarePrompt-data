The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is `k - min(k, k // n)`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0; `i` is 2**
