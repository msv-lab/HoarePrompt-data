The value of `k` is updated to `k - (n * m)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Since `k` was initially less than `n * m`, after the operation, `k` will be a negative value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input minus `n` times the minimum value in the list `a`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0; `k` is negative.**
