The code snippet assigns the value of `math.factorial(n)` to the variable `ans`. This means `ans` is now the factorial of `n`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is the factorial of `n`.**
