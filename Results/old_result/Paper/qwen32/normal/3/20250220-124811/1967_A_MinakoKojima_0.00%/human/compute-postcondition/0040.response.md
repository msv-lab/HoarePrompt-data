Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[i]` updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0; `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a[i]` has been updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
