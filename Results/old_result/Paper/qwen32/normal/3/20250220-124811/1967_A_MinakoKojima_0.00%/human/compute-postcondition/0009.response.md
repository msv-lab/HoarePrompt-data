The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `t`, `k`, `a`, `m`, and `ans` does not directly affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Given that `k` is negative, this is a condition that is set before the loop starts and does not affect the loop's execution directly. The loop will execute based on the value of `n`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is not a concern before the loop starts, as it will be set to 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from the input minus `n` times the minimum value in the list `a` and is negative; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0**
