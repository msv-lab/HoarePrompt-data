The value of `k` is updated to `k - n * m`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `k` is `k - n * m`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `m` is the minimum value in the list `a`; `ans` is 0.**
