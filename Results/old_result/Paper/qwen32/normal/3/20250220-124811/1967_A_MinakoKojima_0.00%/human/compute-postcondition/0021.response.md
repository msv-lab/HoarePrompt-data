The code snippet multiplies the current value of `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation. The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`.**
