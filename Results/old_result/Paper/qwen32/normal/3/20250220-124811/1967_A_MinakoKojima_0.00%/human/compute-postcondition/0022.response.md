To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n` in this case.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and the loop condition `i < n` was satisfied, allowing the loop to execute.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value at the end of the previous iteration.
4. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, let's denote it as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `i_prev`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i_prev + 1` or simply `i + 1` if we consider `i` from the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is `ans * (a[i] - a[i - 1])`**

However, since `ans` is calculated within the loop and we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we do not need to include the `ans` calculation in the state. Therefore, the final adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `i` is `i + 1`**
