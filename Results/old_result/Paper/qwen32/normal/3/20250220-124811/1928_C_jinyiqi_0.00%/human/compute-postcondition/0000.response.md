The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `output1`. This action does not affect the values of `x` and `n`, which are integers such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\). The only change is the creation of `output1` as an empty list.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is an empty list.**
