Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x`. It returns a list that is the concatenation of `output2` and `output1`. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in descending order. `output2` contains the complementary divisors of `x` (i.e., `x // i` for each `i` in `output1`), also in descending order.**
