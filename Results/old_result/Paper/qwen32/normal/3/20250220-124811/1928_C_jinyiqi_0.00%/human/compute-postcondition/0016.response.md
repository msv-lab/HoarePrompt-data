The code snippet provided reverses the list `output1`. The lists `output1` and `output2` are not affected in terms of their contents, only the order of elements in `output1` is changed. Specifically, the elements in `output1` that were previously in ascending order will now be in descending order.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, now in descending order; `output2` is a list containing the corresponding complementary divisors of `x` (i.e., `x // i` for each `i` in `output1`).**
