The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters, which are derived from `x`. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the integer value of the square root of `x` plus one.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 again, provided that it remains within the bounds specified by the loop condition.

Given that `i` was incremented at the end of the last iteration, the new value of `i` should be the previous value of `i` plus 1. The values of `x` and `n` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and are not modified within the loop as per the provided information.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `i` is now `i + 1`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `output1` contains the integer `i` and `output2` contains the integer `x / i`. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.**
