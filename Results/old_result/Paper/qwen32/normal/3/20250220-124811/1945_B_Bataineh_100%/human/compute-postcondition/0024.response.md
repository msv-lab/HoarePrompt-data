Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the condition `m < a and m < b` holds. Otherwise, `m` is either not less than both `a` and `b`, which means `m` is either greater than or equal to `a` or greater than or equal to `b`.**
