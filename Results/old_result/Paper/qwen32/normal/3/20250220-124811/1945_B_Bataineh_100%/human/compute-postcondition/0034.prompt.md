Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m < a and m < b:
        print(2)
    elif m < a and m > b:
        print(2 + m // b)
    elif m < b and m > a:
        print(2 + m // a)
    else:
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from input, and `m` is an integer read from input. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, then `i` is not initialized. Otherwise, `m` is not less than both `a` and `b`, which means `m` is either greater than or equal to `a`, greater than or equal to `b`, or between `a` and `b` (exclusive). If `m` is between `b` and `a` (exclusive), then `m < a` and `m > b`. If `m` is between `a` and `b` (exclusive), then `a < m < b`. `i` is not initialized in either case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the condition `m < a and m < b` holds. Otherwise, `m` is either not less than both `a` and `b`, which means `m` is either greater than or equal to `a` or greater than or equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the state of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remains unchanged from the precondition. Otherwise, the state of `t`, `a`, and `m` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
