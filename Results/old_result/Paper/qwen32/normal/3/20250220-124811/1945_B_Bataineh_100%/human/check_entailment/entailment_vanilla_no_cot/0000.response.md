Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic provided in the program is incorrect and does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations over the time period.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at the same time by considering the periodicity of the fireworks launches and their visibility duration. This involves finding the number of fireworks launched by each installation within a given period and considering the overlaps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    from math import gcd

    def max_fireworks(a, b, m):
        lcm = a * b // gcd(a, b)  # Least Common Multiple of a and b
        count_a = (m + 1) // a  # Number of fireworks from the first installation
        count_b = (m + 1) // b  # Number of fireworks from the second installation
        count_ab = (m + 1) // lcm  # Number of fireworks from both installations (overlap)
        return count_a + count_b - count_ab

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(max_fireworks(a, b, m))

func()
```

This program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap of fireworks launches. It then calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m + 1` and subtracts the overlap to get the correct count.
