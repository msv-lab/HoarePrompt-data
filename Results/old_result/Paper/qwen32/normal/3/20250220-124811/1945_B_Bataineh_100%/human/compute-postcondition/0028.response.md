To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given information step by step.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input.
- `i` is `i + 1` (However, `i` is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task).

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2 + m // b)
```

Explanation:
- `m // b` is an integer division of `m` by `b`, which means it will return the quotient of the division, discarding any remainder.
- The result of `m // b` is then added to 2.

Since the specific values of `m` and `b` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m // b`. However, we know that the output will be `2` plus the integer division of `m` by `b`.

Output: **2 + (m // b) (where m // b is the integer division of m by b)**
