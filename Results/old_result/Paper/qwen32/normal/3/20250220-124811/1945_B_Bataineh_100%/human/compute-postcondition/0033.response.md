Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the state of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remains unchanged from the precondition. Otherwise, the state of `t`, `a`, and `m` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition.**
