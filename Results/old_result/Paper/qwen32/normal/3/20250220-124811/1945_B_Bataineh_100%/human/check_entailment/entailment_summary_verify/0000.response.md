### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

The task is to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time given the launch frequencies `a` and `b` and the visibility duration `m + 1` minutes for each firework.

#### Key Points:
1. **Launch Times:**
   - The first installation launches fireworks at times `a, 2a, 3a, ...`
   - The second installation launches fireworks at times `b, 2b, 3b, ...`
   
2. **Visibility:**
   - Each firework is visible from the launch time `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
   - If two fireworks are launched `m` minutes apart, they will overlap for one minute.

#### Problem with the Provided Program:
The provided program does not accurately compute the maximum number of overlapping fireworks at any given time. The logic in the program is overly simplistic and does not account for the actual overlaps between the fireworks from the two installations.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the launch times and visibility periods for both installations and find the maximum number of overlapping fireworks at any point in time. This involves considering the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the fireworks launches and then checking the overlaps within one period.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's revisit the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Test Case:** `1 2 3 5`
- **Expected Output:** `4`

**Explanation:**
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times: `2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...`
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times: `3, 6, 9, 12, ...`
- Fireworks are visible for 6 minutes (from launch to launch + 5 minutes).

**Visibility Intervals:**
- At time `2`: Only firework from the first installation (visible until `7`).
- At time `3`: Only firework from the second installation (visible until `8`).
- At time `4`: Only firework from the first installation (visible until `9`).
- At time `5`: Only firework from the first installation (visible until `10`).
- At time `6`: Both fireworks from the first and second installations (visible until `11` and `11` respectively).
- At time `7`: Both fireworks from the first and second installations (visible until `11` and `11` respectively).
- At time `8`: Only firework from the second installation (visible until `13`).
- At time `9`: Only firework from the second installation (visible until `14`).
- At time `10`: Only firework from the first installation (visible until `15`).

Thus, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2` (at times `6` and `7`).

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the overlaps and visibility periods. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not accurately compute the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.

### Final: **False**
