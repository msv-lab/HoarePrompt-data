Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input, and `i` is not initialized. Either `m` is not less than `a` or `m` is not less than `b`. If `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`, then the condition `m < a and m > b` holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `m` is less than `a` and greater than `b`. If `m` is less than `b` and greater than `a`, then `m` satisfies `a < m < b`. Otherwise, it is not true that `m` is less than `b` and greater than `a`.**

To simplify and make it more understandable:
Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive. `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers, and `i` is not initialized. The value of `m` is either not less than `a` or not less than `b`. If `m` is between `b` and `a` (exclusive), then `m < a and m > b` holds. Otherwise, `m` does not satisfy both `m < a` and `m > b`. If `m` is between `a` and `b` (exclusive), then `a < m < b` holds. Otherwise, `m` does not satisfy both `m < b` and `m > a`.**
