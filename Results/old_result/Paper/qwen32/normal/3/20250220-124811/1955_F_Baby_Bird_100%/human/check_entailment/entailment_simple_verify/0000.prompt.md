You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p1, p2, p3, and p4 (0 ≤ p1, p2, p3, p4 ≤ 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: result for each test case, separated by newlines



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to ensure it meets the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a sequence of integers where each integer is between 0 and 4.
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Key Points:
- XOR properties:
  - XOR of a number with itself is 0 (e.g., `a ^ a = 0`).
  - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., `a ^ 0 = a`).
  - XOR is commutative and associative.
- The goal is to maximize the number of times the XOR of the sequence is zero after each removal.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the following logic:
- For each number type (1, 2, 3, 4), it calculates how many pairs can be formed (`x // 2`), and how many single elements remain (`x % 2`).
- It then sums up these values and divides by 3 to determine the maximum number of times the XOR can be zero.

### Detailed Breakdown:
- **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- **Calculation**:
  - For each count `x` of a number type, it calculates how many pairs can be formed (`x // 2`).
  - It also counts the remaining single elements (`x % 2`).
  - It sums up these values for all number types.
  - Finally, it divides the total by 3 to get the number of times Bob can win.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:
1. **Example 1**: `1 1 1 0`
   - XOR: `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 = 1` (Alice wins initially).
   - Eve can remove one 1, leaving `1 ^ 1 = 0` (Bob wins).
   - Maximum Bob wins: 1.
2. **Example 2**: `1 0 1 2`
   - XOR: `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 0` (Bob wins initially).
   - Eve can remove one 1 and one 3, leaving `2 ^ 2 = 0` (Bob wins).
   - Maximum Bob wins: 1.
3. **Example 3**: `2 2 2 0`
   - XOR: `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 0` (Bob wins initially).
   - Eve can remove pairs optimally to keep the XOR zero.
   - Maximum Bob wins: 3.
4. **Example 4**: `3 3 2 0`
   - XOR: `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 1` (Alice wins initially).
   - Eve can remove pairs optimally to maximize Bob's wins.
   - Maximum Bob wins: 3.
5. **Example 5**: `0 9 9 9`
   - XOR: `2 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ ... ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 ^ ... ^ 4 = 0` (Bob wins initially).
   - Eve can remove pairs optimally.
   - Maximum Bob wins: 12.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case based on the provided logic. It handles all edge cases and examples correctly.

**Correctness: True**.

The program follows the problem description accurately and handles the given examples correctly. There are no apparent cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.
