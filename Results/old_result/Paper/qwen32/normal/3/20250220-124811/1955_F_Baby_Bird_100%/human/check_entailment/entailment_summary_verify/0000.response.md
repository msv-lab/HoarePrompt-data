Let's re-evaluate the provided program and its logic to ensure it correctly determines the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

### Key Points:
- XOR properties:
  - XOR of a number with itself is 0 (e.g., `a ^ a = 0`).
  - XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., `a ^ 0 = a`).
  - XOR is commutative and associative.
- The goal is to maximize the number of times the XOR of the sequence is zero after each removal.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the following logic:
- For each number type (1, 2, 3, 4), it calculates how many pairs can be formed (`x // 2`), and how many single elements remain (`x % 2`).
- It then sums up these values and divides by 3 to determine the maximum number of times the XOR can be zero.

### Detailed Breakdown:
- **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
- **Calculation**:
  - For each count `x` of a number type, it calculates how many pairs can be formed (`x // 2`).
  - It also counts the remaining single elements (`x % 2`).
  - It sums up these values for all number types.
  - Finally, it divides the total by 3 to get the number of times Bob can win.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:
1. **Example 1**: `1 1 1 0`
   - XOR: `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 = 1` (Alice wins initially).
   - Eve can remove one 1, leaving `1 ^ 1 = 0` (Bob wins).
   - Maximum Bob wins: 1.
2. **Example 2**: `1 0 1 2`
   - XOR: `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 0` (Bob wins initially).
   - Eve can remove one 1 and one 3, leaving `2 ^ 2 = 0` (Bob wins).
   - Maximum Bob wins: 1.
3. **Example 3**: `2 2 2 0`
   - XOR: `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 0` (Bob wins initially).
   - Eve can remove pairs optimally to keep the XOR zero.
   - Maximum Bob wins: 3.
4. **Example 4**: `3 3 2 0`
   - XOR: `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 1` (Alice wins initially).
   - Eve can remove pairs optimally to maximize Bob's wins.
   - Maximum Bob wins: 3.
5. **Example 5**: `0 9 9 9`
   - XOR: `2 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 3 ^ ... ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 ^ ... ^ 4 = 0` (Bob wins initially).
   - Eve can remove pairs optimally.
   - Maximum Bob wins: 12.

### Evaluation of the Program's Logic:
The provided program's logic is flawed. The program sums up the number of pairs and remaining single elements and divides by 3, which does not correctly determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The logic does not account for the XOR properties and the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to consider the XOR properties and the optimal removal strategy:
- If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins.
- If the initial XOR is non-zero, Eve can remove numbers to make the XOR zero.
- The optimal strategy involves removing pairs of numbers that cancel each other out in terms of XOR.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The original assessment is incorrect.

**Final: False**.
