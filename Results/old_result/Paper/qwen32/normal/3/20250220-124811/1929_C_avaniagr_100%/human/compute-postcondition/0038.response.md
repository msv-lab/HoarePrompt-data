Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the input string `s`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, the condition in the if part is met. Otherwise, the condition in the else part is met. In both cases, `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their values as initially described.**
