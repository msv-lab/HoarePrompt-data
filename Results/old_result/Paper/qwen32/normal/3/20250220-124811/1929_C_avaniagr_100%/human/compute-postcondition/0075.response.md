Postcondition: **`s` is the next input string from the file, `t` remains unchanged. If `x == k - 1`, then `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting `s`, and the condition `a >= x + 2` is evaluated but does not affect the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`. Otherwise, `k` is 3, `x` is 5, `a` is an integer, and `z` is 17. If `a` is greater than or equal to 17, then `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 17; otherwise, `a` is less than 17.**
