Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case contains three integers k, x, and a, where 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. There are t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = k - 2
        for i in range(x - k + 3):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers derived from the split string `s` with constraints `2 ≤ k ≤ 30`, `1 ≤ x ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9`. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `a` remains greater than or equal to `x + 1`; otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` equals `k - 1`, `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 2` or less than `x + 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains unchanged; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the input string `s`. If `x < k - 1`, no additional changes occur. If `x == k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `k` is set to 5, `x` is set to 10, `a` remains unchanged, and `z` is set to 32. Additionally, if `a` is greater than or equal to 32, then `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the next input string from the file, `t` remains unchanged, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the new `s`. If `x < k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds true; otherwise, `a < x + 1`. If `x == k - 1`, then the condition `a >= x + 2` is evaluated but does not affect the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`. If `x > k - 1`, then `k` is 3, `x` is 5, `a` is an integer, and `z` is 17. If `a` is greater than or equal to 17, then `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 17; otherwise, `a` is less than 17.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
