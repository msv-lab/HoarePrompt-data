Postcondition: **`s` is the next input string from the file, `t` remains unchanged, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the new `s`. If `x < k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition `a >= x + 1` holds true; otherwise, `a < x + 1`. If `x == k - 1`, then the condition `a >= x + 2` is evaluated but does not affect the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`. If `x > k - 1`, then `k` is 3, `x` is 5, `a` is an integer, and `z` is 17. If `a` is greater than or equal to 17, then `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 17; otherwise, `a` is less than 17.**
