To determine the new value of `z`, we need to compute the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.

Given:
- `z` is initially `k + 1`
- `k` is an integer between 2 and 30
- `x` is an integer between `k` and 100 (inclusive) and not equal to `k - 1`
- `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9
- `i` is 2

Let's calculate the new value of `z`:
- `z // (k - 1)` is the integer division of `z` by `k - 1`
- `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` means we add `z // (k - 1) + 1` to the current value of `z`

The new value of `z` will be:
\[ z_{\text{new}} = z + \left(\frac{z}{k-1}\right) + 1 \]
\[ z_{\text{new}} = (k + 1) + \left(\frac{k + 1}{k - 1}\right) + 1 \]

Since `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `k - 1` is an integer between 1 and 29. The expression `(k + 1) // (k - 1)` will be an integer. 

Let's compute this in a general form:
\[ z_{\text{new}} = (k + 1) + \left\lfloor \frac{k + 1}{k - 1} \right\rfloor + 1 \]

Where `⌊x⌋` denotes the floor function, which rounds `x` down to the nearest integer.

So, the new value of `z` is:
\[ z_{\text{new}} = k + 2 + \left\lfloor \frac{k + 1}{k - 1} \right\rfloor \]

The value of `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between `k` and 100 (inclusive) and not equal to `k - 1`, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `z` is `k + 2 + (k + 1) // (k - 1)`, `i` is 2**
