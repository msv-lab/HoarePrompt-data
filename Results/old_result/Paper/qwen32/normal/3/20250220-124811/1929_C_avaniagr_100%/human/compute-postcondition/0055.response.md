The code `k, x, a = map(int, s.split())` splits the input string `s` into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The variable `s` is the next input string from the file, and `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the next input string from the file, `t` remains unchanged, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained by splitting the new `s`.**
