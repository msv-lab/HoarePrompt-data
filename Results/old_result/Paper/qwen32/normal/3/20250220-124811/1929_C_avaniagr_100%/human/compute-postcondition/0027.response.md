The provided initial state does not affect the output of the `print` statement in the given code snippet. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the conditions or values of `x`, `k`, `a`, and `z`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides some conditions (`x + k`, `a < z`), but these do not influence the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
