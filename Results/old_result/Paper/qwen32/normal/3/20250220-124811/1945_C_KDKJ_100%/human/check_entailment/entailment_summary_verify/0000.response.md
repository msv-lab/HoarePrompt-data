Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

### Analysis of `func_1()`:

1. **Input Reading**: `func_1()` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: It calculates prefix sums for the number of '0's and '1's up to each position. This is done by iterating through the string `a` and maintaining a running count of '0's and '1's.
3. **Validation and Selection of Position**:
   - It iterates over all possible positions `i` from 0 to `n`.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: the number of '0's on the left side (from position 0 to i-1).
     - `lsum`: the number of houses on the left side (which is `i`).
     - `right`: the number of '1's on the right side (from position i to n-1).
     - `rsum`: the number of houses on the right side (which is `n - i`).
   - It checks if the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are satisfied.
   - If the conditions are satisfied, it checks if the current position `i` is closer to the middle than the previously found valid position `ans`.
   - If it is, it updates `ans`.

### Detailed Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum calculation is correct. The array `S` stores pairs of cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position.
   - For example, if `a = "101"`, `S` will be `[[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2]]`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - For instance, if `i = 2` in the example where `a = "101"`, `left = 1`, `lsum = 2`, `right = 1`, and `rsum = 1`. Both conditions `1 * 2 >= 2` and `1 * 2 >= 1` are satisfied.

3. **Minimizing Distance to Middle**:
   - The program correctly minimizes the distance to the middle by updating `ans` only if the current position `i` is closer to the middle than the previously found valid position.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `-1`, which is a valid placeholder since `i` will always be non-negative.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The road can be placed before the first house (`i = 0`).
   - The road can be placed after the last house (`i = n`).
   - The program handles cases where all residents want to live on the same side.

### Testing with Examples:

Let's test the program with the provided examples again to ensure correctness:

- **Example 1**: `n = 3`, `a = "101"`
  - Road after house 2: Left side = "10", Right side = "1"
  - Left condition: 1 '0' >= 2/2 (True)
  - Right condition: 1 '1' >= 1/2 (True)
  - Distance to middle: |3/2 - 2| = 0.5
  - Correct answer: 2

- **Example 2**: `n = 6`, `a = "010111"`
  - Road after house 3: Left side = "010", Right side = "111"
  - Left condition: 2 '0's >= 3/2 (True)
  - Right condition: 3 '1's >= 3/2 (True)
  - Distance to middle: |6/2 - 3| = 0
  - Correct answer: 3

- **Example 3**: `n = 6`, `a = "011001"`
  - Road after house 2: Left side = "01", Right side = "1001"
  - Left condition: 1 '0' >= 2/2 (True)
  - Right condition: 2 '1's >= 4/2 (True)
  - Distance to middle: |6/2 - 2| = 1
  - Correct answer: 2

- **Example 4**: `n = 3`, `a = "000"`
  - Road after house 0: Left side = "", Right side = "000"
  - Right condition: 3 '0's >= 3/2 (True)
  - Distance to middle: |3/2 - 0| = 1.5
  - Correct answer: 0

- **Example 5**: `n = 3`, `a = "110"`
  - Road after house 2: Left side = "11", Right side = "0"
  - Left condition: 0 '0's >= 2/2 (False)
  - Road after house 1: Left side = "1", Right side = "10"
  - Right condition: 1 '1' >= 2/2 (True)
  - Distance to middle: |3/2 - 1| = 0.5
  - Correct answer: 1

- **Example 6**: `n = 3`, `a = "001"`
  - Road after house 0: Left side = "", Right side = "001"
  - Right condition: 1 '1' >= 3/2 (False)
  - Road after house 1: Left side = "0", Right side = "01"
  - Left condition: 1 '0' >= 2/2 (True)
  - Distance to middle: |3/2 - 1| = 0.5
  - Correct answer: 1

- **Example 7**: `n = 4`, `a = "1100"`
  - Road after house 2: Left side = "11", Right side = "00"
  - Left condition: 0 '0's >= 2/2 (False)
  - Road after house 1: Left side = "1", Right side = "100"
  - Right condition: 1 '1' >= 3/2 (False)
  - Road after house 0: Left side = "", Right side = "1100"
  - Right condition: 2 '1's >= 4/2 (True)
  - Distance to middle: |4/2 - 0| = 2
  - Correct answer: 0

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all the given examples and edge cases. It efficiently calculates the prefix sums and checks the conditions for each possible road position. It also correctly minimizes the distance to the middle and handles cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house.

**Final: True**
