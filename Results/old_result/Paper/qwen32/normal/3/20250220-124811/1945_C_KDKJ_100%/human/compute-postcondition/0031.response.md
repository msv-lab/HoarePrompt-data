The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables or affect the conditions or state of the program other than moving to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, none of the variable values are changed. The loop simply continues to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `ans` is -1, `n` is at least 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, and either `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` holds true.**
