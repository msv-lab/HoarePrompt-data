Reasoning:
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` processes a single test case, while `func_2` handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function starts by reading an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n`.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: It calculates a prefix sum array `S` where `S[i]` contains the count of '0's and '1's in the string `a` up to index `i-1`.
3. **Finding Suitable Position**: It iterates through all possible positions `i` (from 0 to `n`) to check if placing the road between houses `i` and `i+1` satisfies the conditions:
   - At least half of the residents on the left side of the road want to live on the left side.
   - At least half of the residents on the right side of the road want to live on the right side.
4. **Optimal Position Selection**: Among all valid positions, it selects the one that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`. If there are multiple such positions, it selects the smaller one.
5. **Output**: It prints the selected position `i`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Multiple Test Cases**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times.
2. **Calling `func_1`**: For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the input and print the result.

### Correctness:
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The prefix sum array `S` is correctly calculated to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's up to each position.
- **Condition Check**: The conditions for placing the road are correctly implemented: it checks if the number of '0's on the left is at least half the length of the left segment and if the number of '1's on the right is at least half the length of the right segment.
- **Optimal Position Selection**: The function correctly selects the position `i` that minimizes `|n/2 - i|` among all valid positions. If multiple such positions exist, it selects the smaller one.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

Given the above analysis, the code correctly implements the problem statement and handles the input/output as required.

Correctness: **True**
