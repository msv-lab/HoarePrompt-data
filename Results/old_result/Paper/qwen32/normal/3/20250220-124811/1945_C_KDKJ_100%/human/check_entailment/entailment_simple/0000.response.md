### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the optimal position to place a road in a village such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side of the street. The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it processes the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program uses a list `S` to store prefix sums. `S[i]` stores the count of '0's and '1's in the first `i` houses.
   - `S` is initialized with `[0, 0]` to represent the counts before the first house.
   - For each house, it updates the counts and appends the new counts to `S`.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `-1`, representing an invalid position initially.
   - It iterates over all possible positions `i` where the road can be placed (from `0` to `n`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's (`left`) and '1's (`right`) on the left and right sides of the road, respectively.
   - It checks if the conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` are satisfied, where `lsum` and `rsum` are the number of houses on the left and right sides, respectively.
   - If the conditions are satisfied and the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position `ans`, it updates `ans` to `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all positions, the program prints the optimal position `ans`.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case (n = 3, a = "101"):**
   - `S = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2]]`
   - For `i = 0`: `left = 0`, `right = 2` (condition not satisfied)
   - For `i = 1`: `left = 0`, `right = 2` (condition not satisfied)
   - For `i = 2`: `left = 1`, `right = 1` (condition satisfied, `ans = 2`)
   - For `i = 3`: `left = 1`, `right = 0` (condition not satisfied)
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case (n = 6, a = "010111"):**
   - `S = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 1], [2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4]]`
   - For `i = 0`: `left = 0`, `right = 4` (condition not satisfied)
   - For `i = 1`: `left = 1`, `right = 3` (condition satisfied, `ans = 1`)
   - For `i = 2`: `left = 1`, `right = 3` (condition satisfied, `ans = 1` (closer to middle))
   - For `i = 3`: `left = 2`, `right = 2` (condition satisfied, `ans = 3` (closer to middle))
   - For `i = 4`: `left = 2`, `right = 2` (condition satisfied, `ans = 3` (not closer to middle))
   - For `i = 5`: `left = 2`, `right = 1` (condition not satisfied)
   - For `i = 6`: `left = 2`, `right = 0` (condition not satisfied)
   - Output: `3`

The program correctly computes the optimal position for the road in each test case as per the problem description.
