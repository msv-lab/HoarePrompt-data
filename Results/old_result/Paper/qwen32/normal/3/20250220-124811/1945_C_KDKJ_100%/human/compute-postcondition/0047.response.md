The code snippet `left = S[i][0]` updates the value of `left` to be the first element of the list at index `i` in the list `S`. Given that `i` is `k + 2`, the new value of `left` will be `S[k + 2][0]`.

Here are the updated variables and their values:
- `left` is now `S[k + 2][0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `left` is `S[k + 2][0]`, `lsum` is `k + 1`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[k + 1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (k + 1)`**.
