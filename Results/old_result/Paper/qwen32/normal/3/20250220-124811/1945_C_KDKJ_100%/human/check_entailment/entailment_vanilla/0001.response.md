Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective:** Determine the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side preference.
- **Constraints:**
  - The road can be placed before the first house (position `i = 0`), between any two houses (position `1` to `n-1`), or after the last house (position `i = n`).
  - For the left side (houses 1 to `i`), at least `ceil(i / 2)` residents should prefer the left side (`a_j = 0`).
  - For the right side (houses `i+1` to `n`), at least `ceil((n - i) / 2)` residents should prefer the right side (`a_j = 1`).
  - Among all valid positions, choose the one closest to the middle of the village (`min |n/2 - i|`).
- **Input:** Multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` with characters `0` and `1`.
- **Output:** For each test case, output the optimal position `i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the number of houses `n` and the preference string `a`.
   - Initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]` to keep track of the cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s up to each house.
   - Iterates through the string `a` to populate `S` where `S[i]` contains the cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s up to the `i-1`th house.
   - Initializes `ans` to `-1`, which will store the optimal position.
   - Iterates through all possible positions `i` (from `0` to `n`) to check if placing the road after the `i`th house satisfies the conditions:
     - `left * 2 < lsum` checks if the number of `0`s on the left side is less than half of the houses on the left side.
     - `right * 2 < rsum` checks if the number of `1`s on the right side is less than half of the houses on the right side.
     - If both conditions are satisfied, it checks if `i` is closer to `n/2` than the current `ans` and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - Prints the optimal position `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- **Initialization:** The list `S` correctly keeps track of cumulative counts of `0`s and `1`s.
- **Condition Checks:** The conditions `left * 2 < lsum` and `right * 2 < rsum` correctly ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- **Optimal Position Selection:** The logic to choose the position closest to the middle is correctly implemented.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases such as placing the road before the first house (`i = 0`) and after the last house (`i = n`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position to place the road based on the given problem description.

**Correctness: True**
