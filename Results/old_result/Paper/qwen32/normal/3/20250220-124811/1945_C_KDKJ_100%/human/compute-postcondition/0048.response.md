The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `lsum`. Given that `i` is `k + 2`, `lsum` will now hold the value `k + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 2`, `left` is `S[k + 2][0]`, `lsum` is `k + 2`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[k + 1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (k + 1)`**
