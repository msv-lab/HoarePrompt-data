Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `left` is `S[k + 1][0]`, `lsum` is `k + 1`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[k + 1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (k + 1)`, `ans` is `k + 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been assigned the value of `i`, which is `k + 1`. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
