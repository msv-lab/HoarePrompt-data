Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `left` is `S[k + 1][0]`, `lsum` is `k + 1`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[k + 1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (k + 1)`. If `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)`, then `ans` is updated to `k + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
