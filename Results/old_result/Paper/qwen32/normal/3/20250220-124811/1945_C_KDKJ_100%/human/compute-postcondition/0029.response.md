The code snippet assigns the value `n - i` to the variable `rsum`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The values of `n` and `i` are used to calculate `rsum`, but their values themselves do not change. The initial state specifies that `S` is a list of lists, `ans` is -1, `n` is at least 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, and `right` is `count_not_0 - S[i][1]`. These remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `ans` is -1, `n` must be at least 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`.**
