The provided code snippet only calls the function `func_1()`. Since there is no definition or effect of `func_1()` within the snippet, we can only assume that the function `func_1()` has been executed, and it may have side effects or return values that are not shown in the snippet. However, based on the initial state provided, the only information we have is that `func_1()` has been executed. The other conditions, such as `func_2` not having any parameters and `int(input())` returning a value greater than 1, are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed, `func_2` does not have any parameters, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 1.**
