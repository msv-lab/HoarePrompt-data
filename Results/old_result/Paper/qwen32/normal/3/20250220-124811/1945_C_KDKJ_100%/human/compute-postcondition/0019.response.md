The code snippet `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given that `x` is the last character of the string `a`, this operation will treat `x` as its ASCII value, increment it, and then `x` will hold the character corresponding to this new ASCII value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least 2 characters, `s` is the next character in the string `a` after the current `s`, `x` is the character in the string `a` that follows the original `x` in the ASCII sequence, `y` is the last character of the string `a`.**
