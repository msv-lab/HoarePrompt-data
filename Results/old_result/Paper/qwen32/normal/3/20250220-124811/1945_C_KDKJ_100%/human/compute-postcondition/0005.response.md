Output State: **The function `func_1()` has been executed, `func_2` does not have any parameters, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet only calls the function `func_1()`, which means that the state of the program after this execution is that `func_1()` has been executed. The function `func_2` and the condition that `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0 are not affected by this code snippet.
