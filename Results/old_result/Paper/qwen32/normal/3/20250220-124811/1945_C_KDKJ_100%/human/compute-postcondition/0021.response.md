Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer input by the user, `a` is a string input by the user that must have at least 2 characters, `s` is the next character in the string `a` after the current `s`. If `s` is '0', `x` is the character in the string `a` that follows the original `x` in the ASCII sequence. Otherwise, `x` is the last character of the string `a`. `y` is the last character of the string `a` if `s` is '0', or the character following the last character of the string `a` in the ASCII sequence if `s` is not '0'.**
