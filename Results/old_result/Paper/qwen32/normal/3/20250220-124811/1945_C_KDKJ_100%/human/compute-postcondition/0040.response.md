The code snippet `right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]` updates the value of the `right` variable. The value of `right` is now the difference between the second element of the last sublist in `S` and the second element of the sublist at index `i` in `S`.

Given that `i` is `k + 1`, `S[-1][1]` is `count_not_0` (from the initial state), and `S[i][1]` is `S[k + 1][1]`, the new value of `right` is `count_not_0 - S[k + 1][1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `n` is at least 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `left` is `S[k + 1][0]`, `lsum` is `k + 1`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[k + 1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (k + 1)`**.
