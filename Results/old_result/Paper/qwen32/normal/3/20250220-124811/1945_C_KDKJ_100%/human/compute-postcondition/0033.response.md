Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], [x1, y1], ..., [xn, yn], [count_0, count_not_0]]`, `ans` is -1, `n` must be at least 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `count_not_0 - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, and either `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`. Additionally, the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.**

In simpler terms, the postcondition states that `S` is a list of lists as described, `ans` is initially -1, `n` is at least 0, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` are calculated as described, and the condition `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` holds. Furthermore, the current value of `i` is such that the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is smaller than the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.
