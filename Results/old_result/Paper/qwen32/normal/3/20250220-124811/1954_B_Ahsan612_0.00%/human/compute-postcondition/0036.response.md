The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print(-1)`. This statement will output the value `-1` regardless of the values of the variables `same`, `minn`, `num`, `i`, or `ar` because the print statement is explicitly printing the integer `-1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print(-1)` statement is a direct output of the integer `-1`.
2. The variables `same`, `minn`, `num`, and `i` are described in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.
3. The list `ar` and its length are also mentioned in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
