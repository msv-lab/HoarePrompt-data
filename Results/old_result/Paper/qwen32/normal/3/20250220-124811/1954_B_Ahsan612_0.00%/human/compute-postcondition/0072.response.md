The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. This directly affects the variable `i`. The other variables (`ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`) remain unchanged by this single line of code.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `ar` has a length greater than `i`, `same` is incremented by 1 if `ar[i]` equals `num`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 2, `num` is set to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.**
