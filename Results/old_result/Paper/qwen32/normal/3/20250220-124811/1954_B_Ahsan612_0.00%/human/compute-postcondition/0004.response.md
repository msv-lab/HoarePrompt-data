The code assigns the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. The values of `n`, `ar`, and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is still the input integer, `ar` is still the list of integers, `same` is still 1, and `num` is the first element of `ar`.

Output State: **The input value must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`.**
