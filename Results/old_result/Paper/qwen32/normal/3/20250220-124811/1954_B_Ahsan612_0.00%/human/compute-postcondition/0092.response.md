Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`, `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`, `n` is an input integer, and the element at index `i` of `ar` is not equal to `num`**

In simpler terms, the value of `num` has been updated to the element at index `i` of the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged.
