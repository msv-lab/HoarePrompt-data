The code snippet provided does not affect the variables `i`, `same`, `minn`, or `num`. It only introduces a new variable `n` which is assigned the value of an integer input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the introduction of `n` as an input integer while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is 1 if the last sequence of consecutive elements in `ar` has only one element, or it is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements if they are more than one, `minn` is either `inf` or a finite value that is less than or equal to the current value of `same`, and `num` is the last unique number encountered in the list; `n` is an input integer.**
