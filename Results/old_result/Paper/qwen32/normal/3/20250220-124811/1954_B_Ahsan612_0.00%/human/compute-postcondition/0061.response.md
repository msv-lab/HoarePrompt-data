The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. 

Since `minn` is already updated to the minimum of its previous value and the previous value of `same` if `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially, the subsequent line will ensure that `minn` remains the smallest value between its current state and the current value of `same`.

Therefore, the updated value of `minn` will be the minimum of its previous value and the current value of `same`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `ar` has a length greater than 1, `same` is 1 if `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially, otherwise `same` is incremented by 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and the current value of `same`.**
