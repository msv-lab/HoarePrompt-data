The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. The initial state specifies that `i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1` and that accessing `ar` at this index would raise an `IndexError`. However, the provided code does not interact with `ar` or `i` in any way, so their states remain unchanged. The only change is the assignment to `same`.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(ar) + 1`, `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`, an `IndexError` is raised, `same` is 1**.
