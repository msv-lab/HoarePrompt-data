The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. This means that the value of `num` changes to the first element of `ar`. The other variables (`ar`, `i`, `same`, `minn`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is 1, `minn` is either `inf` or a finite value that is less than or equal to the current value of `same`, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `n` is an input integer.**
