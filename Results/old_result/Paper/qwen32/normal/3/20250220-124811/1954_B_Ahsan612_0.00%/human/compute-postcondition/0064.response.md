Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `ar` has a length greater than 1; If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, `same` is incremented by 1. If `ar[i]` was not equal to `num`, `same` is reset to 1, `num` is set to `ar[i]`, and `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the current value of `same`. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num` and `ar[i]` did not equal `num` initially, `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the previous value of `same`.**

In natural language: The variable `i` is increased by 1. All other conditions and variables remain as described in the initial state, with the understanding that the next iteration of whatever loop this code is in will re-evaluate the conditions based on the new value of `i`.
