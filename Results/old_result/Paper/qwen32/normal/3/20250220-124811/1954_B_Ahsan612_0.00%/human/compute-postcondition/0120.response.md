To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to understand the operations performed within the loop for each test case. The loop processes each test case independently, where `n` is the length of the array `ar`, and `ar` is a list of integers.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the operations:
1. **Initialization**: For each test case, `same` is initialized to 1, `num` to the first element of `ar`, and `minn` to infinity.
2. **Iteration**: The loop iterates through the array `ar` starting from the second element. It counts consecutive equal elements (`same`). When a different element is encountered, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, then resets `same` to 1 and updates `num` to the new element.
3. **Final Update**: After the loop, it performs a final update to `minn` with the last `same` value.
4. **Output**: It prints `-1` if `minn` is still infinity (which means the array was empty, but the problem guarantees `n >= 1`), otherwise, it prints `minn`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the state after all iterations by understanding that each test case is processed independently and the final state is dependent only on the current test case's array.

### Final Output State Calculation
The final output state after all iterations will be determined by the last test case processed. The variables `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` will reflect the state after processing the last test case.

Let's assume the last test case is the same as the third test case provided:
- `ar` is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
- `i` will be 7 (length of `ar`)
- `same` will be 2 (count of the last sequence of consecutive elements, which is [3, 3])
- `num` will be 3 (last unique number encountered)
- `minn` will be 2 (minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered in the array)

Thus, the final output state after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`minn` is 2, `i` is 7, `same` is 2, `num` is 3, `ar` is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], and `n` is 7.**

In natural language, this means that after processing all test cases, the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in the last test case's array is 2. The loop index `i` is at the end of the array (`i` is 7), the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements (`same`) is 2, the last unique number encountered (`num`) is 3, the array `ar` is [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3], and the length of the array `n` is 7.
