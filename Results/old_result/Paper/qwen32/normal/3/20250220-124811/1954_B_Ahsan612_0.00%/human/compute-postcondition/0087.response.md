To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the loop condition `i < len(ar)`. The state right before the loop is as follows:

- `ar` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- `same` is 1.
- `minn` is `inf`.
- `num` is the first element of `ar`.
- `n` is an input integer.

The loop condition `i < len(ar)` must be true for the loop to execute. Given that `i` is 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-step Analysis:
- `i` is already set to 1, which is fine.
- The condition `i < len(ar)` requires `len(ar)` to be greater than 1.
- Since `ar` is a list of integers read from the input, we need to ensure that `ar` has more than one element.

### Conclusion:
To make sure the loop executes, the list `ar` must have at least two elements. The other variables (`same`, `minn`, `num`, `n`) do not affect the loop condition directly and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 1, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `n` is an input integer**
