To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is `i < len(ar)`, where `i` is the index and `len(ar)` is the length of the list `ar`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `i < len(ar)` must be true. Since `i` is already 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Identify the critical variables**: The critical variables in the loop condition are `i` and `len(ar)`.
2. **Current state of variables**: `i` is 1, and `ar` is a list of integers.
3. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: For the loop to execute, `i < len(ar)` must be true. Given `i` is 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that the length of `ar` is greater than 1.

State: **The input value must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 1**.
