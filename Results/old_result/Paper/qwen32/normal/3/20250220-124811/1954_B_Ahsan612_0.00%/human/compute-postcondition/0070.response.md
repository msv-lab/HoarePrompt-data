The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `same`. The other variables (`i`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `ar` has a length greater than `i`, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1.**
