The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust these variables accordingly.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is not explicitly given for `i` and `len(ar)`, but we know the loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` should be less than `len(ar)`.

If `i` is equal to or greater than `len(ar)` after the previous iteration, we need to adjust either `i` or `len(ar)` to make sure `i` is less than `len(ar)`.

Since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we can either decrease `i` or increase `len(ar)`.

For simplicity, let's assume that `i` is currently equal to `len(ar)`, and we need to adjust `len(ar)` to be one more than `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`**
