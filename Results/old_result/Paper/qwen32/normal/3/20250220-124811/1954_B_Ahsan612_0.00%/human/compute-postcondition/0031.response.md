Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`. If `ar[i] == num`, `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, an `IndexError` is raised and `same` is 1.**

Note: The precondition states `i` is equal to `len(ar)` and `len(ar)` must be `len(ar) + 1`, which seems contradictory. However, based on the provided if and else parts, it appears that the intention is to check if `ar[i] == num` where `i` is `len(ar)`, which would normally cause an `IndexError` since `i` is out of bounds. The if part seems to assume a hypothetical scenario where this access is valid, and `same` is incremented. The else part correctly identifies the `IndexError` and sets `same` to 1.
