The given initial state provides details about several variables and their values, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print(-1)`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the integer `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the list `ar`, the integer `i`, the integer `same`, the variable `minn` set to infinity, the integer `num`, and the integer `n`.
2. The condition `minn == inf` is true, but this condition is not used in the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement is `print(-1)`, which is a direct output of the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
