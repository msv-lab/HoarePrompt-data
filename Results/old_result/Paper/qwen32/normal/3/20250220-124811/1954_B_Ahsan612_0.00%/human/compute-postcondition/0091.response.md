Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `n` is an input integer, and the element at index `i` of `ar` is not equal to `num`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables (`ar`, `same`, `minn`, `num`, `n`) remain unchanged.
