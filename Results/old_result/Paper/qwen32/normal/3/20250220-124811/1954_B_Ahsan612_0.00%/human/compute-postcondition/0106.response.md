The value of `same` is incremented by 1. Given that `same` is either 1 or 3, after the increment, `same` will be either 2 or 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ar` must have at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `same` is either 2 or 4, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is either the first element of `ar`, the element at index `i` - 1 of `ar`, or `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `n` is an input integer**.
