Output State: **`ar` must have at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 4 or 5, `same` is either 1 or 3, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, and `n` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to be the element at index `i` in the array `ar`. All other variables retain their initial state and constraints.
