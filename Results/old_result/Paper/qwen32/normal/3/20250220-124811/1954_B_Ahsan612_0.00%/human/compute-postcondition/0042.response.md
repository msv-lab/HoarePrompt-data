The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `ar`. This operation does not affect the variables `same`, `minn`, `num`, or `i` directly, as they are not initialized or modified in this snippet. However, the list `ar` is now populated with integers based on the input.

Output State: **The loop will continue until `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. `same` will hold the count of consecutive elements equal to `num` at the end of the last sequence of equal elements. `minn` will hold the minimum count of consecutive equal elements encountered during the entire iteration, updated to be the minimum between its current value and `same` if `minn` was not initially `inf`. `num` will hold the last unique number encountered in the list. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it remains `inf`; otherwise, it is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements. `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` after the loop terminates. `n` is an input integer. `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

In simpler terms: The list `ar` is now filled with integers from the input, while other variables remain in their initial states as described.
