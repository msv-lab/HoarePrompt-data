The code snippet updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given the initial state, `minn` can be either `inf` or `1`, and `same` can be either `1` or `2`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:
1. If `minn` is `inf` and `same` is `1`, then `minn` will be updated to `1`.
2. If `minn` is `inf` and `same` is `2`, then `minn` will be updated to `2`.
3. If `minn` is `1` and `same` is `1`, then `minn` will remain `1`.
4. If `minn` is `1` and `same` is `2`, then `minn` will remain `1`.

In all cases, `minn` will not be greater than `1` after the execution of the code. Therefore, the updated value of `minn` will be `1`.

Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `same` is either 1 or 2, `minn` is 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, and `n` is an input integer.**
