Postcondition: **`ar` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is either 1 or 2, `same` is either 1 or 2, `minn` is either `inf` or 1, `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` of `ar`, and `n` is an input integer. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 1, `same` is 2, and `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is updated to the element at index `i` of `ar`.**
