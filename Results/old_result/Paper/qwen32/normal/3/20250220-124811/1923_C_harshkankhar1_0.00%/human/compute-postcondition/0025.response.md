Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `q`, where `n` is the number of elements in a list `c` and `q` is the number of queries. The list `c` contains `n` integers, each greater than 0 and up to 10^9. For each query, it accepts two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range in the list `c`. The function processes these queries and returns the sum of the elements in the list `c` for each specified range `[l_i, r_i]`.**
