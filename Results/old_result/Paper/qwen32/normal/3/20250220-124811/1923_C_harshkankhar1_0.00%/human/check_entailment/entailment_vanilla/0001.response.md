Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The program is supposed to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` of an array `c` (where `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`) is "good" according to the conditions outlined in the problem statement.

### Conditions for a Good Subarray
1. The sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` should be equal to the sum of another array `b[l_i:r_i+1]`.
2. Every element in `c[l_i:r_i+1]` should be different from the corresponding element in `b[l_i:r_i+1]`.
3. Every element in `b[l_i:r_i+1]` should be greater than 0.

### The Program's Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - The input array `c` is read and stored in `a` with an extra `0` at the beginning for easier prefix sum calculation.
   - An array `b` of the same length as `a` is initialized with `0`s.

2. **Constructing `b`**:
   - For each element `a[i]` in `a` (starting from index `1`), the program sets `b[i]` to `b[i-1] + x`, where `x` is `1` if `a[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise.
   - This ensures that `b[i]` is always greater than `0` and is different from `a[i]` if `a[i] > 1`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of `a` and stores them back in `a`.

4. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` using the prefix sums stored in `a`.
   - It also calculates the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` using the prefix sums stored in `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if `l_i == r_i`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Construction of `b`**:
   - The construction of `b` is not correct. The program sets `b[i]` to `b[i-1] + x` where `x` is `1` or `2` based on the value of `a[i]`. However, this does not ensure that the sum of `b[l_i:r_i+1]` will be equal to the sum of `c[l_i:r_i+1]` for any subarray.
   - The program does not guarantee that `b[l_i:r_i+1]` will be different from `c[l_i:r_i+1]` for every index `i` in the subarray.

2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if `l_i == r_i`. However, this check is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is good.
   - The program does not ensure that every element in `b[l_i:r_i+1]` is greater than `0` and different from the corresponding element in `c[l_i:r_i+1]`.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
