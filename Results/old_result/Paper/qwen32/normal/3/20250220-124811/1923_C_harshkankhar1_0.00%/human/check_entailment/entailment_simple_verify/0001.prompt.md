You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The program is supposed to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` of an array `c` (where `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`) is "good" according to the conditions outlined in the problem statement.

### Conditions for a Good Subarray
1. The sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` should be equal to the sum of another array `b[l_i:r_i+1]`.
2. Every element in `c[l_i:r_i+1]` should be different from the corresponding element in `b[l_i:r_i+1]`.
3. Every element in `b[l_i:r_i+1]` should be greater than 0.

### The Program's Approach
1. **Initialization**:
   - The input array `c` is read and stored in `a` with an extra `0` at the beginning for easier prefix sum calculation.
   - An array `b` of the same length as `a` is initialized with `0`s.

2. **Constructing `b`**:
   - For each element `a[i]` in `a` (starting from index `1`), the program sets `b[i]` to `b[i-1] + x`, where `x` is `1` if `a[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise.
   - This ensures that `b[i]` is always greater than `0` and is different from `a[i]` if `a[i] > 1`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of `a` and stores them back in `a`.

4. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` using the prefix sums stored in `a`.
   - It also calculates the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` using the prefix sums stored in `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if `l_i == r_i`. If either condition is true, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program
1. **Construction of `b`**:
   - The construction of `b` is not correct. The program sets `b[i]` to `b[i-1] + x` where `x` is `1` or `2` based on the value of `a[i]`. However, this does not ensure that the sum of `b[l_i:r_i+1]` will be equal to the sum of `c[l_i:r_i+1]` for any subarray.
   - The program does not guarantee that `b[l_i:r_i+1]` will be different from `c[l_i:r_i+1]` for every index `i` in the subarray.

2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the subarray in `b` or if `l_i == r_i`. However, this check is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is good.
   - The program does not ensure that every element in `b[l_i:r_i+1]` is greater than `0` and different from the corresponding element in `c[l_i:r_i+1]`.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
