The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, meaning `i` is now one more than it was at the start of the last iteration. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. For the loop to continue, `k + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `k` must be less than `n`. Since `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1 again at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1**. Given that `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, now `i` is `k + 1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific and concrete, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4**.

However, to generalize:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state as:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

But for a more concrete example, if `i` was 3:
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 4**.

Given the task requirements, the most accurate general state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
