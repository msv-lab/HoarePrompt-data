The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value it took, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Since the loop iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration. The value of `n` remains the same unless the loop condition changes, which it does not in this case.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` is determined by the condition `a[i] > 1`, but `x` is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.
- `b[i]` is calculated as `b[i - 1] + x`, but `b[i]` is also not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, we only need to adjust `i` to be `i + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1**
