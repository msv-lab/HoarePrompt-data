### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided functions to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- We need to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons.
- The constraints are:
  - Each screen is 5x3, meaning it has 15 cells.
  - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
  - We need to minimize the number of screens used.

#### Analysis of Functions:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function returns the smaller of two integers.
   - It is not used in the execution summary of `func_2` or `func_3`, so it does not contribute to solving the problem as described.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of screens required for a given pair of `x` (1x1 icons) and `y` (2x2 icons).
   - **Logic**:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - Calculate `bxsfory` as `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which represents the minimum number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit at most 2 2x2 icons, we divide `y` by 2 and round up.
       - Adjust `x` by subtracting `bxsfory * 15` (the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons) and adding `y * 4` (the actual cells occupied by 2x2 icons, since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).
       - Calculate `bxsfory1` as `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if `x` is still greater than 0 after the adjustment. This represents the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, plus one extra screen if there are any remaining icons.
       - Print the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - Simply print `math.ceil(y / 2)`, as no 1x1 icons are needed.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - Print `math.ceil(x / 15)`, as no 2x2 icons are needed.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - Print `0`, as no icons are needed.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - It handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

#### Correctness Check:
- The logic in `func_2` seems to be correct for the problem statement.
- It correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and adjusts the remaining cells for 1x1 icons.
- The function handles edge cases where `x` or `y` is 0.
- `func_3` correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program is correct as per the provided problem description and execution summaries.

**Correctness: True**
