You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` reads a positive integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and calls `func_2` `t` times. It does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given icons. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for `x` and `y`**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates `x` after placing `2x2` icons. Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not make logical sense. The term `bxsfory * 15` seems arbitrary and incorrect. The correct approach should be to subtract the number of `1x1` cells occupied by the `2x2` icons and then calculate how many additional `1x1` icons can be placed on the remaining cells.

2. **Incorrect Calculation for `bxsfory1`**:
   - The calculation for `bxsfory1` is also incorrect. The code attempts to calculate the remaining `1x1` icons and then determines how many screens are needed, but the logic is flawed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle some edge cases correctly. For example, when `x` and `y` are such that a combination of `2x2` and `1x1` icons can fill the screen more optimally than the current logic suggests.

To demonstrate the incorrectness, let's consider a test case:

**Input**:
```
1
11 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2
```

**Explanation**:
- We have 1 `2x2` icon and 11 `1x1` icons.
- The `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells.
- We can place 11 `1x1` icons in the remaining cells, but since the screen size is 15 cells, we need 1 screen for the `2x2` icon and another screen for the 11 `1x1` icons, totaling 2 screens.

However, the provided code will not output `2` for this case. The logic in `func_2` is flawed, leading to incorrect results for various inputs.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
