In the given initial state, the variables `x` and `y` are defined with constraints on their values, but these constraints do not affect the execution of the `print` statement in the provided code snippet. The `print(0)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `x` and `y`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state specifies constraints on `x` and `y`, but these constraints do not influence the `print` statement.
2. The `print(0)` statement directly outputs the integer `0`.

Therefore, based on the given information and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **0**
