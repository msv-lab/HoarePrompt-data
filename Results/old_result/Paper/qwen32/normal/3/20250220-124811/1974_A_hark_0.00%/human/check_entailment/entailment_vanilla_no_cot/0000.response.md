Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for all test cases. Specifically, the logic for placing the 1x1 and 2x2 icons is flawed. 

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Function `func_2`:** This function is responsible for calculating the minimum number of screens for a given test case. The calculation logic is incorrect.

   - When both `x` (number of 1x1 icons) and `y` (number of 2x2 icons) are greater than 0, the program incorrectly calculates the remaining 1x1 icons (`x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`). This formula does not accurately represent the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
   
   - The program also incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`). The `+1` at the end is incorrect and will always add an extra screen if there are any remaining 1x1 icons.

2. **Function `func_1`:** This function is not used anywhere in the program and can be removed.

To fix the program, we need to correctly calculate the number of screens required to place all the 2x2 icons first, then place the remaining 1x1 icons. Here's a corrected version of the function `func_2`:

```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 4)
    # Calculate remaining space in terms of 1x1 cells
    remaining_space = (5 * 3 - 4 * screens_for_2x2) * 4
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
    screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
    # Total screens needed
    total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
    # If we have used some 1x1 space in the screens used for 2x2, adjust the count
    if remaining_space > 0 and x > 0:
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + math.ceil((x - remaining_space) / 15)
    else:
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
    print(total_screens)
```

However, this logic can be simplified. The correct approach is to first place as many 2x2 icons as possible, then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons. Here is a more straightforward implementation:

```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 4)
    # Calculate remaining space in terms of 1x1 cells
    remaining_space = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
    # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
    screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
    # If we have used some 1x1 space in the screens used for 2x2, adjust the count
    if remaining_space > 0:
        screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil((x - remaining_space) / 15)
    total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
    print(total_screens)
```

This logic ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for all test cases.
