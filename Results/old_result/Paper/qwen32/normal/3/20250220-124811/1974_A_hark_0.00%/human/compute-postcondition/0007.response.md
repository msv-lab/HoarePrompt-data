To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the initial state and the behavior of the loop.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

### Loop Behavior:
- The loop runs `t` times.
- In each iteration, `func_2()` is called, but its effect on `t` is not specified in the problem description. Therefore, we assume `t` is not modified by `func_2()`.

### Analysis:
- Since the loop runs `t` times and `t` is not modified within the loop, the loop will execute exactly `t` times.
- After all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial value.

### Output State:
- `t` remains the same as the input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer, such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**
