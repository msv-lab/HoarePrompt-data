### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and see if it correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required to place the application icons.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is defined but never used in the provided code. It simply returns the smaller of two integers, `a` and `b`. Since it's not utilized, it doesn't impact the correctness of the solution.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is responsible for reading the input values `x` and `y` for each test case and calculating the minimum number of screens required.
   - **Case 1**: When both `x > 0` and `y > 0`:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`: This calculates the minimum number of screens required for the `2x2` icons. Since each screen can fit at most two `2x2` icons, we take the ceiling of `y / 2`.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`: This line seems incorrect. It's trying to adjust `x` based on the number of `2x2` icons placed, but the logic seems flawed. After placing `bxsfory` number of `2x2` icons, the remaining space is not correctly calculated. The correct approach would be to calculate the remaining space after placing the `2x2` icons and then determine how many `1x1` icons can fit into the remaining space.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`: This line calculates the number of screens required for the remaining `1x1` icons. If `x` is non-positive, no additional screens are needed. Otherwise, it calculates the number of screens required for the remaining `1x1` icons.
     - `print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)`: This prints the total number of screens required.
   - **Case 2**: When `x == 0` and `y > 0`:
     - `print(math.ceil(y / 2))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens required for the `2x2` icons.
   - **Case 3**: When `x > 0` and `y == 0`:
     - `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`: This correctly calculates the number of screens required for the `1x1` icons.
   - **Case 4**: When `x == 0` and `y == 0`:
     - `print(0)`: This correctly indicates that no screens are required.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2` for each test case.

### Key Issues:
- The logic to calculate the remaining space after placing `2x2` icons and then fitting `1x1` icons is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the remaining space on the screens after placing the `2x2` icons.

### Correctness:
Based on the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
