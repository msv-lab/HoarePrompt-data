The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `t`. Since `_` is not used within the loop head and is just a placeholder, the only variable we can adjust is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, and `t` may have been modified by `func_2()`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 because the loop will run `t` times. Since the loop has just completed one iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer, such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `t` may have been modified by `func_2()`**
