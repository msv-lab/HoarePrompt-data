To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_2()` and how it affects the variables. However, since the function `func_2()` is not provided in the code snippet, it is impossible to determine the exact changes it makes to the variables.

Given the lack of details about `func_2()`, we can only assume that `func_2()` does not modify the variable `t` unless specified otherwise. Therefore, based on the provided information, the variable `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**.
