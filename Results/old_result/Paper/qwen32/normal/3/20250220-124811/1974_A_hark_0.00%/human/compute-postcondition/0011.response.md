To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given code and the initial state:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.
   - `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`.
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `y` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(math.ceil(x / 15))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `y` is 0, it does not affect the calculation in the `print` statement.
   - `x` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).
   - The expression `x / 15` computes the division of `x` by 15.
   - `math.ceil()` is a function that rounds up to the nearest integer.

4. **Possible Values**:
   - The smallest value of `x` is 1, so `1 / 15` is approximately `0.0667`. `math.ceil(0.0667)` results in `1`.
   - The largest value of `x` is 99, so `99 / 15` is approximately `6.6`. `math.ceil(6.6)` results in `7`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The output will be an integer between 1 and 7, depending on the exact value of `x`.

Since `x` can take any value from 1 to 99, the `print` statement will output a value between 1 and 7, rounded up from the division of `x` by 15.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is an integer between 1 and 99)**
