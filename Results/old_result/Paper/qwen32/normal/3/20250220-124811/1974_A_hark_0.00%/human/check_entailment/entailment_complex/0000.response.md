### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place a certain number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. The program consists of three functions, with `func_3` being the main function that handles multiple test cases, and `func_2` performing the core logic for each test case. Here is a detailed breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is defined but not used in the provided code. It appears to return the smaller of two integers. However, it is not relevant to the current implementation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.
   - **Logic**:
     - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
       - Calculate `bxsfory` as `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This represents the minimum number of screens needed to place the 2x2 icons, considering each screen can hold a maximum of 2 such icons.
       - Update `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This step seems incorrect as it does not properly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
       - Calculate `bxsfory1` as `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. This step calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, but the formula is flawed.
       - Print the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
     - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
       - Simply print `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct.
     - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
       - Print `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is correct.
     - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
       - Print `0`, which is correct.
   - **Issues**:
     - The logic for updating `x` and calculating `bxsfory1` is incorrect. The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not accurately reflect the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. Instead, it should account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells should be calculated accordingly.
     - The formula `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` for `bxsfory1` is also incorrect. It should be `math.ceil(x / 15)` because each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_2` `t` times, which is correct as it processes each test case independently.

### Conclusion:
The logic for handling the cases where either `x` or `y` is zero is correct. However, the logic for handling the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than zero is flawed due to incorrect calculations for remaining space and additional screens needed. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
