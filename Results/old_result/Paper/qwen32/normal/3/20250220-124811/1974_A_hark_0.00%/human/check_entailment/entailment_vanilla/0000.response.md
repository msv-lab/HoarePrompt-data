Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a grid of size 5x3 (15 cells).
   - We have two types of icons: 1x1 and 2x2.
   - The goal is to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons on the minimum number of 5x3 screens.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells, so if we place a 2x2 icon, we need to account for 4 cells.
   - The 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell each.
   - Each screen has 15 cells.

3. **Logic in the Program:**
   - The program defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` is not used in the program.
   - `func_2` is the core function that calculates the number of screens needed for a single test case.
   - `func_3` is the main function that handles multiple test cases.

4. **Logic in `func_2`:**
   - The function reads `x` and `y` from the input.
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it attempts to place as many 2x2 icons as possible and then calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it returns 0 (no screens needed).

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It incorrectly subtracts 15 cells for each 2x2 icon placed and adds back the cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons is flawed.
   - The program does not correctly account for the placement of 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

### Correct Approach:
- First, place as many 2x2 icons as possible.
- Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
- Place the remaining 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.
- Calculate the total number of screens needed based on the total number of cells occupied by both types of icons.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic of the program, the provided code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
