To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_2()` and how it modifies `t`. Since the implementation of `func_2()` is not provided, we can only infer the state based on the precondition that `t` may have been modified by `func_2()`.

Assuming `func_2()` could modify `t` in any way, the only change we can be certain of is that `t` will hold a new value after the function call. The output state will reflect this change. Given no other information, we can't specify the exact value of `t` after the function call, but we can state that `t` has been updated.

Output State: **`t` is an updated input integer, such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**.
