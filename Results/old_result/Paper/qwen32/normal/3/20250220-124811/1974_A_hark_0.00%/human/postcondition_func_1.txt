The function reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (where `0 <= x <= 99` and `0 <= y <= 99`) from the input, performs calculations based on their values, and prints a result. The printed result is the sum of `math.ceil(y / 2)` and `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `math.ceil(y / 2)` if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, `math.ceil(x / 15)` if `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, and `0` if both `x` and `y` are 0.
