The code snippet `lex = lex - 26` will subtract 26 from the current value of `lex`. Given the initial state, `lex` is already defined based on the user input with a conditional adjustment. After the operation, `lex` will be further reduced by 26. The values of other variables (`t`, `cases`, `arr`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input minus 52 if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, otherwise `lex` is `lex - 52`, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26] depending on the initial value of `lex`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 3**.
