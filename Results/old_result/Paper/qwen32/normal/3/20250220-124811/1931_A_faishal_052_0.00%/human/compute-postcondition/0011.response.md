Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer greater than 0 but less than 26, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `arr` is a list containing the integer 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26, so if `lex` was initially greater than 26 but less than 52, it will now be greater than 0 but less than 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
