Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now `lex - 1` (and thus less than or equal to 25), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26`, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, or `[26, 26, 1]`, and `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `arr` has been updated by appending `1` to it, changing its possible values to `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, or `[26, 26, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
