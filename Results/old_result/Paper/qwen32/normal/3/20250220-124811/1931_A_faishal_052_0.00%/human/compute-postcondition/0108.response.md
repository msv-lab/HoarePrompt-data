Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer greater than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements (the last element is 26), `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2. Additionally, if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, the last element of `arr` is 26.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The value of `lex` remains as specified in the initial state. The value of `cases` remains greater than 2. The list `arr` now has at least 5 elements, with the last element being 26. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged at 3, 1, and 2 respectively. If `lex` was initially greater than 26 and less than 52, this condition still holds true, and the last element of `arr` is 26.
