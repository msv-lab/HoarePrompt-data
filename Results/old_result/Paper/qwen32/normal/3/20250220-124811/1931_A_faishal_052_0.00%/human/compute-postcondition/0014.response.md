The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. The other variables such as `t`, `cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer greater than 52 minus 26, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, and for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `arr` is a list containing the integer 26.
