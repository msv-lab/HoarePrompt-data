### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic in detail to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
- The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.
- The output should be the smallest possible word for each test case.

#### Program Analysis:
The program processes each test case as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.
3. It initializes an array `arr` to store the values of the three letters.
4. It then processes `lex` to assign values to the first two positions of `arr`:
   - If `lex` is ≤ 26, it assigns 1 to the position and reduces `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is < 52, it assigns 26 to the position and reduces `lex` by 26.
   - Otherwise, it assigns 26 to the position and reduces `lex` by 26.
5. The remaining value of `lex` is assigned to the third position of `arr`.
6. It sorts the array `arr` to ensure the letters are in lexicographical order.
7. It prints the corresponding letters by converting the values in `arr` to characters.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**:
   - The program assigns either 1 or 26 to the first two positions based on the value of `lex`. This logic does not guarantee the smallest possible letters.
   - For example, if `lex` is 25, the program assigns 1, 1, and 23, resulting in "aab". However, "aaa" would be the correct smallest word.

2. **Sorting After Assignment**:
   - Sorting the letters after assigning them does not ensure the smallest possible word because the assignment logic itself is flawed.
   - Sorting is not sufficient to fix the incorrect distribution logic.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `lex` is exactly 3, which should result in "aaa".

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem:
1. Start with the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a').
2. Distribute the remaining sum (`lex - 3`) among the three letters in a way that keeps the word lexicographically smallest.
3. Increment the letters from the last to the first to ensure the smallest possible word.

#### Corrected Program Logic:
1. Initialize the letters as 'a', 'a', 'a'.
2. Distribute the remaining sum (`lex - 3`) by incrementing the letters from the last to the first to keep the word lexicographically smallest.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the distribution logic and the incorrect handling of the letter assignment, the provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
