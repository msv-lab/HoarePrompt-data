Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now less than or equal to 0, otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26`, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list containing either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`, and `j` is 1.**
