The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 1 (and still less than or equal to 25), `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2.
