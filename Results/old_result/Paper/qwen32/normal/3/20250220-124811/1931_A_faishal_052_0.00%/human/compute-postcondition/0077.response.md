Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer value provided by the user input minus 52 if the initial `lex` was less than or equal to 26, otherwise `lex` is `lex - 52`, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [26, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26, 26] depending on the initial value of `lex`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 3.**

Note: The postcondition is identical for both the if and else parts, so the overall postcondition remains the same.
