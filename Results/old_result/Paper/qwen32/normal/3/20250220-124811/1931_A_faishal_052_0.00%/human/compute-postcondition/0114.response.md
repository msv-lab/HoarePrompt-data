The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, which is the last iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 1 if it was originally <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer in the range 0 to 25 if it was originally in the range 27 to 51, or greater than 0 if it was originally > 51, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 5 elements where the last element is 26 and the second-to-last element is 26 if `lex` (after decrementing by 1) is greater than 25 and less than 51, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2**
