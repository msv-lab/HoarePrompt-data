The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given that the state before the loop starts includes `t` (the number of test cases) and `n` (the size of each test case), these do not directly affect the loop execution in this context. The loop will execute based on the value of `cases`.

To ensure the loop executes, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we do not need to adjust it beforehand.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `cases` must be greater than or equal to 1**
