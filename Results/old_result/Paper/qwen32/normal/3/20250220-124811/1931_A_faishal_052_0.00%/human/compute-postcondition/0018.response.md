The code snippet `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` initially contains either `[1]` (if `lex` is less than or equal to 26) or `[26]` (if `lex` is greater than 26). After appending `1`, the list `arr` will contain either `[1, 1]` or `[26, 1]`.

The values of `t`, `lex`, `cases`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1]` or `[26, 1]`, `j` is 1**.
