The loop iterates over the range of `k` from 0 to 2, and in each iteration, it prints the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `arr[k] + 96`. Since the range is from 0 to 2, the loop will execute exactly 3 times. The initial state of `k` is 3, but within the loop, `k` is reassigned by the `for` loop construct, so the value of `k` at the end of the loop iterations will be 2.

Given the possible values for `arr`, the output can be one of the following:
- If `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, the output will be `aaa` (if `lex` is 1), `aab` (if `lex` is 2), ..., `aaz` (if `lex` is 26).
- If `arr` is `[1, lex, 26]`, the output will be `aza` (if `lex` is 1), `azb` (if `lex` is 2), ..., `azz` (if `lex` is 26).
- If `arr` is `[lex, 26, 26]`, the output will be `zza` (if `lex` is 1), `zzb` (if `lex` is 2), ..., `zzz` (if `lex` is 26).

Since the loop iterates exactly 3 times and `k` will be 2 at the end of the loop, the final output state of the variables is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is either `[1, 1, lex]`, `[1, lex, 26]`, or `[lex, 26, 26]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2. The loop will have printed the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `arr[0] + 96`, `arr[1] + 96`, and `arr[2] + 96` in sequence.**

In simpler terms, the loop prints three characters based on the values in `arr`, and after the loop finishes, `k` will be 2, while all other variables remain unchanged.
