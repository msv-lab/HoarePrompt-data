Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer greater than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `k` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decreased by 26, so if `lex` was initially greater than 52, it is now greater than 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
