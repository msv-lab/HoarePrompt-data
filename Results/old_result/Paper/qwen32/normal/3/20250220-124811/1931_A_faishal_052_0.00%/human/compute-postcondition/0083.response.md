To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step-by-step.

1. **Variable `t`**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - However, `t` is not used in the given print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

2. **Variable `lex`**:
   - `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value but is less than 26.
   - `lex` is used in the list `arr`, so its value is important.

3. **Variable `cases`**:
   - `cases` is greater than 2.
   - Similar to `t`, `cases` is not used in the given print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

4. **List `arr`**:
   - `arr` can be one of the following:
     - `[1, 1, lex]`
     - `[1, lex, 26]`
     - `[lex, 26, 26]`

5. **Indices `i`, `j`, and `k`**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.

6. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.
   - Since `k` is 0, `arr[k]` will be the first element of `arr`.

Now, let's consider the possible values of `arr[k]` based on the possible configurations of `arr`:

- If `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, then `arr[k]` is `1`.
- If `arr` is `[1, lex, 26]`, then `arr[k]` is `1`.
- If `arr` is `[lex, 26, 26]`, then `arr[k]` is `lex`.

In all cases, `arr[k]` is either `1` or `lex`. Let's examine the `chr(arr[k] + 96)`:

- If `arr[k]` is `1`, then `chr(arr[k] + 96)` is `chr(1 + 96)`, which is `chr(97)`, and `chr(97)` is `'a'`.
- If `arr[k]` is `lex`, then `chr(arr[k] + 96)` is `chr(lex + 96)`. Since `lex` is less than 26, `lex + 96` will be a value between 97 and 121 (inclusive), which corresponds to the characters `'a'` to `'y'`.

Given that `lex` is less than 26, the output will be a character from `'a'` to `'y'`. However, since `arr[k]` can be `1` in two of the three possible configurations of `arr`, the most precise description is that the output will be `'a'` if `arr[k]` is `1`, or a character from `'a'` to `'y'` if `arr[k]` is `lex`.

But since the problem statement asks for the most precise description possible based on the precondition, and `arr[k]` is `1` in two out of three configurations, the most precise and likely output is `'a'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a**
