To determine the output of the provided `print` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. **lex**: Adjusted based on its original value (decremented by 1 or 26 for each iteration).
3. **cases**: Greater than 2.
4. **arr**: A sorted list with 3 elements.
   - The first two elements are either 1 or 26.
   - The third element is `lex`.
5. **i**: 3.
6. **j**: 2.
7. **k**: 0.

### Code Snippet
```python
print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
```

### Analysis
- **k**: The value of `k` is 0.
- **arr[k]**: Since `k` is 0, `arr[k]` refers to the first element of the list `arr`. According to the initial state, the first element of `arr` is either 1 or 26.
- **chr(arr[k] + 96)**: The `chr()` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character. 
  - If `arr[k]` is 1, then `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is the character 'a'.
  - If `arr[k]` is 26, then `chr(26 + 96)` is `chr(122)`, which is the character 'z'.

### Conclusion
Given that the first element of `arr` is either 1 or 26, the output of the print statement will be either 'a' or 'z'.

### Final Output
Output: **a or z (where the specific character depends on the value of the first element of arr, which is either 1 or 26)**
