The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. However, since the loop condition is `j in range(2)`, the loop will not execute again when `j` is 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would be the second iteration in this case) should have `j` incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now `lex - 1` (and thus less than or equal to 25), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 26`. `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`, and `j` is 2**
