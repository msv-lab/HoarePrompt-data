Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an integer greater than 26, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is [26], `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `k` is 3. If `lex` was originally less than 52, then `lex` is now an integer greater than 0 but less than 26. Otherwise, `lex` is the integer value provided by the user input minus 26 and is greater than 26.**
