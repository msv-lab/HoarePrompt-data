The provided loop runs exactly 2 times (as indicated by `for j in range(2):`). Therefore, the loop will not execute more than 2 times, and the "all the executions of the loop" refers to the 2 iterations specified in the loop head.

Here's the breakdown of the final state after 2 iterations:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.
   - `lex` is an input integer.
   - `cases` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `arr` is an empty list.

2. **After the first iteration**:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` becomes `[1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 1`.
   - If `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.
   - If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` becomes `[26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 26`.

3. **After the second iteration**:
   - If `lex` (after the first iteration) is less than or equal to 26, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 1` (which is `lex - 2` from the initial state).
   - If `lex` (after the first iteration) is greater than 26 but less than 52, `arr` becomes `[26, 1]` or `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]` depending on the initial `lex` value, and `lex` becomes `lex - 27` from the initial state.
   - If `lex` (after the first iteration) is 52 or greater, `arr` becomes `[26, 26]` and `lex` becomes `lex - 52` from the initial state.

Since the loop runs exactly 2 times, the final state of the variables after all iterations (2 iterations) is as described in the output state after the loop executes 2 times.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `lex` is an integer, if it was initially less than or equal to 26 then `lex` is now `lex - 2` (and thus less than or equal to 24), otherwise `lex` is `lex - 27` if it was initially between 26 and 51, or `lex - 52` if it was initially between 52 and 77, `cases` is greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list that is either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`, and `j` is 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes its 2 iterations, `t` remains the same, `lex` is reduced by 2 if it was initially 26 or less, by 27 if it was initially between 27 and 51, or by 52 if it was initially 52 or more, `cases` remains unchanged, `arr` contains either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, `[1, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`, and `j` is 1 (the last value of the loop counter).
