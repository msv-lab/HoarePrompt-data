You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `lex` (3 <= lex <= 78). For each test case, it determines three characters based on the value of `lex` and prints these characters concatenated together. The characters are derived from the English alphabet, with the value of `lex` being adjusted to map to specific letters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: An integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` integers `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word.
2. **Output**: For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded.

### Key Points:
- The letters are indexed from 1 to 26.
- The task is to find the lexicographically smallest word whose letter positions sum up to `n`.
- A word is lexicographically smaller if, at the first differing position, it has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest word by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.
3. It then tries to distribute `lex` into three parts, aiming to create the smallest possible letters.
4. It uses a loop to determine the first two letters, and the remaining value as the third letter.
5. It sorts the letters to ensure the word is lexicographically smallest.
6. Finally, it prints the resulting word.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The program incorrectly distributes the values for the first two letters. It checks if `lex` is less than or equal to 26 and assigns 1 or 26 accordingly, which does not guarantee the smallest possible letters.
2. **Sorting After Assignment**: Sorting the letters after assigning them does not guarantee the smallest possible word because the distribution logic itself is flawed.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `lex` is exactly 3 (which should result in "aaa").

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Start with the smallest possible letters ('a', 'a', 'a').
2. Distribute the remaining sum (`lex - 3`) among the three letters in a way that keeps the word lexicographically smallest.

### Corrected Program Logic:
1. Initialize the letters as 'a', 'a', 'a'.
2. Distribute the remaining sum (`lex - 3`) by incrementing the letters from the last to the first to keep the word lexicographically smallest.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the distribution logic and the incorrect handling of the letter assignment, the provided program is incorrect.
