### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to decode an integer back into the lexicographically smallest possible 3-letter word based on the given encoding scheme. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the program logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `lex` which represents the encoded value.

2. **Logic to Decode the Integer:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then enters a loop that runs twice, aiming to assign the maximum possible values (26) to the first two letters unless the remaining value (`lex`) is less than 26.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to the list and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it appends 26 to the list and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is 52 or greater, it also appends 26 to the list and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to the list `arr`.
   - The list `arr` is then sorted in ascending order to ensure the lexicographically smallest combination of letters.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program converts each value in `arr` to its corresponding letter by adding 96 (since 'a' is ASCII 97) and prints the characters.

### Correctness Analysis:

The logic of the program seems flawed because it does not correctly ensure that the decoded word is the lexicographically smallest possible word. Specifically:

- The program attempts to maximize the values of the first two letters, which is counterproductive for finding the smallest word.
- The sorting step is done after assigning values, which does not guarantee the smallest possible word because the order of assignment affects the final result.

### Correct Approach:

To ensure the smallest word, the program should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then adjust the third letter accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

1. **Assign the smallest possible values to the first two letters:**
   - Start by assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the first letter.
   - Assign the smallest possible value (1) to the second letter.
   - Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
   - If the remaining value is greater than 26, adjust the second letter to the next smallest possible value and re-calculate the third letter.
   - Continue this process until the values are valid (i.e., each value is between 1 and 26).

### Conclusion:

Given the provided logic and the flaw in ensuring the smallest lexicographical order, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
