Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `lex` is an input integer minus 27 if it was originally <= 26, otherwise `lex` is an integer in the range -25 to 25 if it was originally in the range 27 to 51, or greater than -25 if it was originally > 51, `cases` is greater than 2, `arr` is a list with at least 6 elements where the last element is 26 and the second-to-last element is 26 if `lex` (after decrementing by 1) is greater than 25 and less than 51, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` has been decremented by 26. If `lex` was originally less than or equal to 26, it is now less than or equal to 0 (specifically, `lex - 27`). If `lex` was originally between 27 and 51, it is now between -25 and 25. If `lex` was originally greater than 51, it remains greater than 25 but is now reduced by 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
