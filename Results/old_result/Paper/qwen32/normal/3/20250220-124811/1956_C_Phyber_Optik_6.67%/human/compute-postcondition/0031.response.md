To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `n + r + 1`.

### Analysis:
- `j` is the loop variable and its value at the start of the next iteration will be `j + 1` from the previous iteration.
- `n` and `r` are not modified within the loop, so their values remain the same.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` could be any value that satisfies the condition `1 <= j <= n + r`.
- `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is computed as `(n + 1) // 2`.

### State Adjustment:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
- The values of `n` and `r` remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
- If `j` was less than or equal to `n + r` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute again with `j` incremented by 1.
- The conditions on `n` and `r` remain as they are.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `r` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `sum` is the computed sum as described above; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and must still be less than or equal to `n + r` for the loop to execute again.**

If `j` was `n + r` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again, and `j` will be `n + r + 1` at the start of the next iteration, but the loop will terminate.

However, if `j` was less than `n + r`, then:

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1; `r` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `sum` is the computed sum as described above; `j` is `j + 1` and is less than or equal to `n + r`.**
