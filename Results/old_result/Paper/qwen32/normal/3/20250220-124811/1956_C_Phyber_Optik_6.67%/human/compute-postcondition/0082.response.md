To determine what will be printed by the `print(1, j, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer read from the input, and it is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 0.
2. **`n`**: A non-negative integer input.
3. **`r`**: The last `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true. This implies that `r` is a non-negative integer.
4. **`sum`**: The total accumulated sum based on some condition. However, the `sum` variable is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
5. **`j`**: A variable that is incremented by 1 from its previous value, ensuring `1 <= j <= n + r`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The `print` statement is `print(1, j, end=' ')`. This means it will print the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j`, and then it will not move to a new line (due to `end=' '`).

### Determining the Value of `j`:
The value of `j` is described as being incremented by 1 and constrained to be within the range `1 <= j <= n + r`. However, without specific values for `n` and `r`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `j`. We can only state that `j` is an integer within the given range.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the integer `1` followed by the value of `j` (which is an integer between 1 and `n + r` inclusive).

Output: **1 [j] (where j is an integer such that 1 <= j <= n + r)**
