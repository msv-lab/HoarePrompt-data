The code snippet `n = int(input())` will reassign the variable `n` to a new integer value provided by the user input. This new value will affect the dependent variables `r`, `sum`, and `j` because they are calculated based on the value of `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `sum` is the computed sum as described above.
- `j` is `n + r + 1`.

After the execution of `n = int(input())`, the value of `n` changes, and consequently, `r` and `j` will also change based on the new value of `n`. The specific values of `r` and `j` depend on the new `n` value. Since the new `n` value is not specified, we express `r` and `j` in terms of the new `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0; `n` is the new integer input; `r` is `(n + 1) // 2`; `sum` is the computed sum as described above (recomputed with the new `n`); `j` is `n + r + 1`.**
