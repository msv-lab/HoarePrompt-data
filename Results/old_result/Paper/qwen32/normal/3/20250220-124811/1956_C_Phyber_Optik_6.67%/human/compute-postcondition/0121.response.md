Let's break down the given code and initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
2. `n` is a non-negative integer.
3. `r` is the largest integer `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true, and it ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2.
4. `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined (though `sum` is not used in the given print statement).
5. `j` is defined as `n + r`.

### Task:
The print statement is `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine `r`**:
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` must be true.
   - Simplifying the condition, we get `(n + 1) // 2 > i`.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` satisfying this condition.
   - This means `r` is the floor of `(n + 1) / 2 - 1`.

2. **Determine `j`**:
   - `j` is defined as `n + r`.
   - Substituting `r`, we get `j = n + floor((n + 1) / 2 - 1)`.

3. **Calculate `j % n`**:
   - `j % n` is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
   - Given `j = n + floor((n + 1) / 2 - 1)`, we need to find `j % n`.

### Simplifying `j % n`:
- If `n` is even, say `n = 2k`, then:
  - `(n + 1) // 2 = (2k + 1) // 2 = k`
  - `r = k - 1`
  - `j = 2k + (k - 1) = 3k - 1`
  - `j % n = (3k - 1) % 2k = k - 1`
- If `n` is odd, say `n = 2k + 1`, then:
  - `(n + 1) // 2 = (2k + 2) // 2 = k + 1`
  - `r = k`
  - `j = 2k + 1 + k = 3k + 1`
  - `j % n = (3k + 1) % (2k + 1) = k`

However, a more general and precise way to express `j % n`:
- `j = n + floor((n + 1) / 2 - 1)`
- `j % n = floor((n + 1) / 2 - 1)`

### Final Output:
The print statement will output `2` followed by `j % n`, which is `floor((n + 1) / 2 - 1)`.

Output: **2, floor((n + 1) / 2 - 1) (where n is a non-negative integer)**
