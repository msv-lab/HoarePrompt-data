Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `r` is equal to `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is set to the value of `i`, which was previously `i + 1`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
