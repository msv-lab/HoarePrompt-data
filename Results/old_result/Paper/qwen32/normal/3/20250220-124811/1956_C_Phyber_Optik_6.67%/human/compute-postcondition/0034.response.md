Let's break down the code snippet and the given initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer read from the input, and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n`: An integer, and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `r`: Calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `sum`: The sum is not explicitly mentioned in the print statement, so we will ignore it for this task.
- `j`: Initially not defined in the initial state, but we know that `j` is incremented (`j = j + 1`) and is less than or equal to `n + r`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet prints two values: `2` and `j % n`.
- `2` is a constant integer and will always be printed as `2`.
- `j % n` is the modulus of `j` divided by `n`. The value of `j` is not explicitly given, but we know that `j` is incremented and is less than or equal to `n + r`. The exact value of `j` at the point of execution is not specified, so we will describe the output in terms of `j`.

### Output Description:
- The first value printed is the constant integer `2`.
- The second value printed is `j % n`, which means the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of `j` and `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, j % n (where j is the current value of j and n is the given integer greater than or equal to 1)**
