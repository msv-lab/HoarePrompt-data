To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the relationships between the variables.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is the largest integer such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2.
- `sum` is a cumulative sum, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `j` is `n + r + 1` and is greater than `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Determine `r`**:
   - `r` is the largest integer satisfying `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for some `i`.
   - This can be simplified to finding the largest `r` such that `(n + 1) // 2 > i`.
   - Since `r` ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2, `r` must be at least `1 - n`.
   - However, `r` must also satisfy the inequality `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. Let's consider the simplest case where `i = r`. This gives us `n * (n + 1) // 2 > r * n`.
   - Simplifying, we get `n + 1 // 2 > r` or `r < (n + 1) // 2`.
   - Therefore, `r` is the largest integer less than `(n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Determine `j`**:
   - `j` is defined as `n + r + 1`.
   - Since `r` is the largest integer less than `(n + 1) // 2`, we can substitute `r` with `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` (the largest integer less than `(n + 1) // 2`).
   - Thus, `j = n + ((n + 1) // 2 - 1) + 1 = n + (n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Calculate `j % n`**:
   - `j % n` is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
   - Since `j = n + (n + 1) // 2`, we need to find the remainder of this expression when divided by `n`.
   - `n % n` is 0, so we only need to consider `((n + 1) // 2) % n`.

### Final Calculation:
- `j % n = ((n + 1) // 2) % n`.
- This expression depends on the value of `n`:
  - If `n` is even, `(n + 1) // 2` is `(n / 2) + 0.5`, which is `(n / 2) + 1` when considering integer division.
  - If `n` is odd, `(n + 1) // 2` is `((n + 1) / 2)`, which is `(n + 1) / 2` when considering integer division.
- In both cases, `((n + 1) // 2) % n` simplifies to `((n + 1) // 2)` because `n` is a factor of `n` and the remainder is just the integer part of `(n + 1) / 2`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement prints `2`, `j % n`, and an empty string at the end due to `end=' '`.
- `j % n` is `((n + 1) // 2) % n`.

Output: **2, (n + 1) // 2 % n**
