The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` was the loop variable at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`. The value of `n` does not change from one iteration to the next in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1`**
