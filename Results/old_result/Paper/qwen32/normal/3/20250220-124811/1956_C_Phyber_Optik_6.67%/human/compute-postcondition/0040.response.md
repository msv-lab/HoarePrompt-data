To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1. However, `t` does not directly influence the `print` statement in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.

2. **Variable `n`**: It is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it is used in the computation of `r` and in the modulo operation.

3. **Variable `r`**: It is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This means `r` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2, which effectively computes the ceiling of `n / 2`.

4. **Variable `j`**: It is described as `j + 1` and is less than `n + r + 1`. This means `j` is being incremented by 1 in each iteration, and it is constrained to be less than `n + r + 1`. However, the exact value of `j` is not provided directly, so we will describe its value in terms of the condition given.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

- The first part of the print statement is the integer `2`, which is a constant value.
- The second part is `j % n`, which is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we can only describe `j % n` in terms of `j` and `n`. Given that `j` is incremented and constrained by `n + r + 1`, `j % n` will be a value between `0` and `n-1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is the remainder of j divided by n)**
