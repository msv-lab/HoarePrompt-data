To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0.
- `n` is a non-negative integer input.
- `r` is defined as the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative.
- `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition.
- `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 2`.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`, the conditions on `t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`, and `j` remain as specified. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n + r` and the loop terminates.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the elements of the `range(1, n + 1)` and prints them separated by spaces. The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.

### Determining the Output:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` will print these numbers separated by spaces.

### Example for Clarity:
Let's assume `n` is 5 (as an example):
- `range(1, 5 + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- `print(*range(1, 5 + 1))` will output: `1 2 3 4 5`.

### General Output:
For any non-negative integer `n`, the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n` printed in a single line separated by spaces.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **1 2 ... n (where n is the non-negative integer input)**
