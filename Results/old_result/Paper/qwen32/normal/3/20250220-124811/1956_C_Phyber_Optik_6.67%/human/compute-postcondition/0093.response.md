The code snippet `r = i` assigns the value of `i` to `r`. The previous value of `r` (which was 0) is now replaced by the value of `i`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `sum`, and `j`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is 0, and `j` is `n + r + 1` (which now becomes `n + i + 1`), and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` still holds true.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is `i`, `sum` is 0, `j` is `n + i + 1`, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**
