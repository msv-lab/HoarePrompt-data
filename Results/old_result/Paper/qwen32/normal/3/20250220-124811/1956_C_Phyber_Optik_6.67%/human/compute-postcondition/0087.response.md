To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve.

The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`. The conditions and actions within the loop do not change the values of `t`, `n`, `r`, or `sum`. The loop only modifies the variable `j` in its iteration.

Here's a breakdown of the loop's behavior:

- For `j` from `1` to `n`, it prints `1`, the current `j`, and then prints numbers from `1` to `n`.
- For `j` from `n + 1` to `n + r`, it prints `2`, `j % n`, and then prints numbers from `1` to `n`.

The loop terminates when `j` reaches `n + r + 1`.

Given this behavior, the final state of `j` after the loop terminates is `n + r + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `r`, and `sum` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is a non-negative integer input, `r` is the last `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true and is non-negative, `sum` is the total accumulated sum based on the condition, and `j` is `n + r + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the loop finishes with `j` being `n + r + 1`, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`) remain as they were at the start of the loop.
