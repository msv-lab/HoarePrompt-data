The loop head in the provided `for` loop includes the variable `j` and the range `1` to `n + r + 1`. According to the loop, `j` is incremented in each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2.
- `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined.
- `j` is `n + r + 1`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition `j <= n` is true. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

Since `j` is currently `n + r + 1`, the loop would not execute again because `j` is not less than `n + r + 1` (it is equal to it). To adjust the state so that the loop can execute one more time, `j` must be set to a value that is less than `n + r + 1`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n + r` (which is one less than `n + r + 1`). This way, the loop can execute one more time with `j` being `n + r + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2, `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined, `j` is `n + r`**
