The code snippet `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding the product of `i` and `n` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, and the pre-incremented `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `sum`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `sum` is increased by `i * n`.**
