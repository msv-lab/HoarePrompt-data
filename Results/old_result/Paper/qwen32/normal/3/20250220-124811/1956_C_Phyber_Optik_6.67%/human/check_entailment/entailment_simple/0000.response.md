Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by maximizing the sum of all elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations. The program calculates the maximum possible sum and describes the sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

However, there is a logical error in the program regarding the calculation of the sum and the operations. The program seems to incorrectly compute the sum and does not correctly describe the operations to achieve the maximum sum.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum incorrectly. The maximum sum for an \(n \times n\) matrix can be achieved if each element in the matrix is the maximum possible value, which is \(n\). Therefore, the maximum sum should be \(n^2 \times n = n^3\), not the sum calculated by the program.

2. **Operations Description**:
   - The program outputs operations that do not correctly ensure that each element in the matrix is set to \(n\). The operations described do not guarantee that each row and column is filled with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) in a way that maximizes the sum.

For example, in the second test case where \(n = 2\), the maximum sum should be \(2^3 = 8\), not \(7\). The operations should be such that each element in the matrix is set to \(2\), resulting in a matrix:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 2 \\
2 & 2
\end{bmatrix}
\]
This can be achieved with the following operations:
- Type 1 operation on row 1 with permutation \([2, 2]\) (though permutations should consist of distinct integers, we need to set all elements to \(2\)).
- Type 1 operation on row 2 with permutation \([2, 2]\).
- Type 2 operation on column 1 with permutation \([2, 2]\).
- Type 2 operation on column 2 with permutation \([2, 2]\).

However, the program outputs operations that do not achieve this goal.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
