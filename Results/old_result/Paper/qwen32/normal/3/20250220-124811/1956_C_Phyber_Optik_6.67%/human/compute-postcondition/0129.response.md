Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is the largest `i` for which `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true and ensures `n + r + 1` is at least 2, `sum` is the cumulative sum as defined, `j` is `n + r + 1`. The condition `j <= n` is evaluated, and since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `n`, `r`, `sum`, or `j`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
