The code snippet provided resets the values of `sum` and `r` to 0. The initial state of `t`, `n`, and `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from the input and is greater than or equal to 0; `n` is the new integer input; `r` is 0; `sum` is 0; `j` is `n + (n + 1) // 2 + 1`.**
