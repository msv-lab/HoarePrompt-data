Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each. For the current index `i`, if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken out of if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` remains False if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
