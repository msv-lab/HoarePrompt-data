Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `possible` is `True`. Additionally, the `i`-th character of `a` is not equal to the `i`-th character of `b`, and the `i`-th character of `c` is neither equal to the `i`-th character of `a` nor the `i`-th character of `b`.**

Explanation: The value of `possible` has been changed from `False` to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
