The code snippet assigns the user input (stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace) to the variable `a`. The other variables `b` and `c` remain unchanged, and the precondition `n` being the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters) is still valid. Since `a` is now assigned a new value, we need to reflect this change in the output state.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is the string provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
