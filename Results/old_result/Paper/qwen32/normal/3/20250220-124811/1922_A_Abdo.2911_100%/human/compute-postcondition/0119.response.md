The code snippet assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 3, and `possible` is `True`.**
