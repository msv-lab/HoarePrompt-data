Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings provided by the user input consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters each, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged and the loop continues.**
