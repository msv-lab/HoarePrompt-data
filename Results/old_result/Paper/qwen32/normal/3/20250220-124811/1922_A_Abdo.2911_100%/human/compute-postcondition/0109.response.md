The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`. `i` is 2**
