Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, and `possible` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is an integer value such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `i` is 3. If `a[3] == b[3]`, then if `c[3]` is not equal to `a[3]`, `possible` is `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `a[3] != b[3]`, then if `c[3]` is equal to `a[3]` or `c[3]` is equal to `b[3]`, the program continues as is. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
