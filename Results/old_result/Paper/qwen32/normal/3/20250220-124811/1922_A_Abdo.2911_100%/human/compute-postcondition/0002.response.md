The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and this precondition still holds after the code is executed, but the specific value of `n` is now determined by the user input. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters**.
