Postcondition: **`t` is `t`, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20), `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `i` is `t + 1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to `False` and the loop or if statement breaks. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the program continues; otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop or if statement breaks.**
