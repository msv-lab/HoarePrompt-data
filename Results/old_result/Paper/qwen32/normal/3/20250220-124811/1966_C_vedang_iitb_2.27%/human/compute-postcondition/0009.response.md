The code snippet assigns the result of the function `func_2` called with the arguments `a[1:]` and `n - 1` to the variable `winNext`. This means that `winNext` now holds whatever value `func_2` returns when it is called with the specified arguments. The list `a` is sliced to exclude the first element, and `n` is decremented by 1. The other conditions and the values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile excluding the first pile, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a) - 1, and `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.**
