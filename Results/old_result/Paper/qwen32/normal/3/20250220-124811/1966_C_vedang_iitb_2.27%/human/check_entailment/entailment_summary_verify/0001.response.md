### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description and Solution Strategy**:
   - The problem revolves around the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum of the pile sizes).
   - If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy.
   - If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy, assuming both play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes the list of pile sizes by removing duplicates, sorting, and computing differences between consecutive elements.
   - This transformation does not help in determining the game's winner based on the Nim-sum. It is irrelevant to the problem's solution.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is recursive and attempts to determine the winner by considering the number of piles and their sizes.
   - The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` are not universally correct:
     - For `n == 1`, Alice wins if there is any stone in the pile.
     - For `n == 2`, the winner is determined by the Nim-sum (XOR of the two pile sizes). The provided logic does not correctly handle this.
   - The recursive logic does not properly compute the Nim-sum or use it to determine the winner. It incorrectly attempts to deduce the winner based on the results of smaller subproblems without considering the XOR-sum.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly determine the winner.
   - The function `func_1` does not contribute to solving the problem.
