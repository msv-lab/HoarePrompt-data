Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; the loop has executed `t` times; for each test case, the program prints "1 1", "1 2", and if `n` is 3, it prints "2 3", otherwise it prints "2 4" followed by lines from "4 4" to "n n" where each line contains the same number printed twice, separated by a space. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after all iterations.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop, the program will have processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it will have printed specific lines based on the value of `n`. The number of test cases `t` and the input `n` for each test case will remain the same after the loop finishes executing.
