To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The for loop is defined as:

```python
for j in range(4, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `j`, `4`, and `n`. Since `4` is a constant, we only need to consider `j` and `n`.

1. **Variable `j`:** This variable is the loop index and it starts at 4. Before the loop starts, `j` is not defined, so it does not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `n`:** The loop will execute if `n` is at least 4. If `n` is less than 4, the range `(4, n + 1)` will be empty, and the loop will not execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least 4.

The variables `t` and `i` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

So, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is at least 4.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer that must be at least 4; `i` is `k+1`**
