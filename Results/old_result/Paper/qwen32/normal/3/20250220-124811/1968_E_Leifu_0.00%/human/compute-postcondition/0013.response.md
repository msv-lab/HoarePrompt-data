The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement `for j in range(4, n + 1)`, `j` starts at 4 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5. The values of `t` and `n` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 50; `n` is an integer where n > 3; `j` is 5**
