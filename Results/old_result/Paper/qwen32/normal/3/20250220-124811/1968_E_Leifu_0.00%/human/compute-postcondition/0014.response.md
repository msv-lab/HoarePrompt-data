Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- `n` is an integer where n > 3.
- `j` is 5.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Here, the variable `j` is explicitly given a value of 5. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string and concatenates it with a space and another string representation of `j`. 

Thus, the output will be the string "5 5".

Output: **5 5**
