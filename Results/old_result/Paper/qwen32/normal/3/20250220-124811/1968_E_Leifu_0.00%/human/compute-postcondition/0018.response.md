The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the newly assigned value of `n` and the unchanged values of `t` and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 50; `n` is the integer input; `i` is `k+1`**.
