To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given initial and intermediate states.

The loop starts at `j = 4` and continues until `j` reaches `n + 1`. Each iteration of the loop prints the current value of `j` twice, separated by a space.

**Initial State Recap:**
- `t`: number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50)
- `n`: an integer where `n` is not equal to 3

**Loop Execution:**
- The loop starts from `j = 4` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop ends when `j` becomes `n + 1`.

**Intermediate States Recap:**
- After 1 iteration: `j` is 4
- After 2 iterations: `j` is 5
- After 3 iterations: `j` is 6

Based on the intermediate states, we can infer that the loop has printed:
- `4 4` after the first iteration
- `5 5` after the second iteration
- `6 6` after the third iteration

**Final State:**
- The loop will continue until `j` equals `n + 1`.
- Therefore, the final value of `j` will be `n + 1`.

The final output state will include all the printed values from `j = 4` to `j = n`.

**Output State:**
- `t` remains unchanged as the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 50)
- `n` remains unchanged
- The loop will print all lines from `4 4` to `n n`

In natural language, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is that the loop will have printed each integer from 4 to `n` twice, separated by a space, and the values of `t` and `n` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; n is an integer where n > 3; the loop prints each integer from 4 to n twice, separated by a space.**
