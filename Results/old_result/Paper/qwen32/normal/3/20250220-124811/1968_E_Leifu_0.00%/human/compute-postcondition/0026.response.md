To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided:

1. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
2. `n` is an integer that must be at least 4.
3. `j` is defined as `i + 1`.

However, the variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `j` is defined as `i + 1`, we need to infer the value of `i` to determine the value of `j`.

Given that `j` is `i + 1`, the exact value of `j` depends on the value of `i`. Since `i` is not provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `j`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `i`.

The `print` statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then with the string representation of `j` again.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **[j] [j] (where j is i + 1)**

Since we don't have the specific value of `i`, we express `j` in terms of `i` in the final output.
