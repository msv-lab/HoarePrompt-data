### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and its strategy against the problem description more thoroughly. We need to ensure that the program maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances for any given `n`.

#### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between `n` points in an `n x n` grid. The Manhattan distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \(|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program currently follows this strategy:
1. For every test case, it prints the first point as \((1, 1)\).
2. It prints the second point as \((1, 2)\).
3. For \(n = 3\), it prints the third point as \((2, 3)\).
4. For \(n > 3\), it prints the third point as \((2, 4)\) and then prints points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).

#### Correctness Assessment:
Let's verify if this strategy can maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances:

- **For n = 2:**
  - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\)
  - Distances: \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Unique distances: \(\{0, 1\}\)
  - This is correct and maximizes the distinct distances for \(n = 2\).

- **For n = 3:**
  - Points: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 3)\)
  - Distances: \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\), \(|1-2| + |1-3| = 3\), \(|1-2| + |1-2| = 0\), \(|2-2| + |3-3| = 0\), \(|2-3| + |1-2| = 2\), \(|2-3| + |1-3| = 1\)
  - Unique distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
  - This is correct and maximizes the distinct distances for \(n = 3\).

- **For n > 3:**
  - The program places points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\) and then \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
  - The points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 4)\) will generate several distances, including 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  - The points \((j, j)\) will generate additional distances as they move diagonally, but these distances will be limited and may not cover all possible Manhattan distances.

#### Evaluation for Larger n:
To maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances, we need to ensure that the points are placed in such a way that they generate a wide range of distances. The current strategy for \(n > 3\) is not optimal because:
- The points \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\) will generate distances that are primarily diagonal and will not cover a wide range of Manhattan distances.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases for \(n = 2\) and \(n = 3\) but does not provide a strategy that maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances for \(n > 3\). For larger \(n\), a different strategy is required to ensure that the maximum number of unique distances is achieved.

Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided strategy is:

### Final: **False**
