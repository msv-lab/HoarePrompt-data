The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 (since the range starts from 4, the last `j` would be `n`), and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value in the range, which is `4` (if the last `j` was `3`, which is not possible as per the range, so let's assume the last `j` was `n-1`).

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 4, and `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 50; `n` is an integer where n > 3; `j` is 4**
