To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` is an integer where \(n > 3\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

### Analysis:
The print statement concatenates the string representations of the variable `j` with a space in between. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `j`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `j` from the given information.

### Conclusion:
Since the value of `j` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `j`.

Output: **j j (where j is the value of the variable j)**
