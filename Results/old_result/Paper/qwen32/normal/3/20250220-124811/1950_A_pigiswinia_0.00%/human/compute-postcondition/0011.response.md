Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true.**
