The initial state describes the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `t` is an integer input by the user within the range 1 to 1000, and `i` is explicitly set to 2. The integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are also read from the input, and their relationship is described by specific conditions, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

The `print` statement in the code is:
```python
print('NONE')
```
This statement prints the string 'NONE' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **NONE**
