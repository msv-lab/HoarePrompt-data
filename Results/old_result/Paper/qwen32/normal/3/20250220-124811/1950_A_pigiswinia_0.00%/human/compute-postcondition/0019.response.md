The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true.**
