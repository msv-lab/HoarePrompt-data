The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. Therefore, only these variables can be adjusted to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input with conditions on their relationships.

Since the loop iterates `t` times, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration. The value of `t` remains the same as it defines the total number of iterations.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true.**
