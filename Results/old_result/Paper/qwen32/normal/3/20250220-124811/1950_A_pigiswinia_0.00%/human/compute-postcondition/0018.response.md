Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input. If `a < b < c`, then the condition `a < b < c` holds. If `a < b > c`, then the condition `a < b > c` holds. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b > c` is true.**
