The provided code snippet only sets the recursion limit for the Python interpreter using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This does not affect the input values or any variables defined in the initial state. It simply allows the program to handle deeper recursion levels if needed, up to a limit of \(10^6\).

Since no variables are explicitly defined or modified in the code snippet, and no return statement is present, the initial state remains unchanged except for the recursion limit being set.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n (3 ≤ n) and m (n ≤ m ≤ min(n*(n - 1)/2, 2 * 10^5)), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The following m lines each contain three integers u, v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) and w (1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6), representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between any pair of vertices, and the graph does not contain self-loops. The sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The recursion limit is set to 10^6.**
