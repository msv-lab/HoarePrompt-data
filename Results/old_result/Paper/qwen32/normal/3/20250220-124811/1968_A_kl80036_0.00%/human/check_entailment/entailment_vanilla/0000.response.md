Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The greatest common divisor (GCD) function, \(\gcd(a, b)\), returns the largest positive integer that divides both \( a \) and \( b \).

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads an integer \( x \). It then calculates \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) (integer division) and prints this value.

### Checking the Program's Correctness

The program uses \( y = x // 2 \). Let's verify if this choice of \( y \) always maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

1. **For even \( x \):**
   - If \( x \) is even, then \( y = x // 2 \) is also even. 
   - \(\gcd(x, y)\) is at least 2 because both \( x \) and \( y \) are even.
   - The expression becomes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \geq 2 + \frac{x}{2} \).

2. **For odd \( x \):**
   - If \( x \) is odd, then \( y = x // 2 \) is even.
   - \(\gcd(x, y)\) is at least 1 because \( x \) is odd and \( y \) is even, and the highest common divisor in this case would be 1.
   - The expression becomes \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + \frac{x-1}{2} \).

However, this approach does not guarantee that \( y = x // 2 \) will always yield the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). We need to consider other values of \( y \) to ensure the maximum is found.

### Counterexamples

Let's consider a counterexample where \( x = 10 \):
- The program outputs \( y = 5 \).
- \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).

However, another possible \( y \) is 9:
- \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

In this case, both 5 and 9 yield the same maximum value, so the program's output is correct for this input. But let's consider another case where \( x = 7 \):
- The program outputs \( y = 3 \).
- \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\).

However, another possible \( y \) is 6:
- \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\).

Here, \( y = 6 \) yields a higher value than \( y = 3 \), so the program's output is incorrect for this input.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Reasoning: The program does not guarantee that the chosen \( y = x // 2 \) will always yield the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). There are cases where other values of \( y \) can result in a higher expression value.
Correctness: **False**
