To determine what will be printed by the `print(y)` statement, we need to follow the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This represents the total number of iterations or tests.
2. **`x`**: A new integer input by the user such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\). This is the input value for each iteration.
3. **`y`**: The integer value of `x // 2` such that \(1 \leq y \leq 500\). This is the integer division of `x` by 2.
4. **`i`**: An integer that is incremented by 1 in each iteration. It must be less than `t`.

### Analysis:
- The variable `y` is calculated as `x // 2`, which means it is the integer part of the division of `x` by 2.
- Since `x` is between 2 and 1000, `y` will be between 1 and 500.
- The specific value of `y` depends on the value of `x` provided by the user in each iteration.

### Example Calculation:
- If `x` is 10, then `y` will be `10 // 2 = 5`.
- If `x` is 200, then `y` will be `200 // 2 = 100`.
- If `x` is 1000, then `y` will be `1000 // 2 = 500`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `y` is determined by the value of `x` provided by the user in each iteration, and it will be the integer division of `x` by 2. Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only describe `y` in terms of `x`.

Output: **y (where y is the integer division of x by 2)**
