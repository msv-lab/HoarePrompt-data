The code snippet assigns the value of `x // 2` to the variable `y`. Given that `x` is an integer input by the user such that `2 <= x <= 1000`, the new value of `y` will be the integer division of `x` by 2, which will be in the range `1 <= y <= 500`.

The other variables `t`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is the new integer input by the user such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is the integer value of `x // 2` such that 1 <= y <= 500, `i` is `i + 1`, and `i` must be less than `t`.**
