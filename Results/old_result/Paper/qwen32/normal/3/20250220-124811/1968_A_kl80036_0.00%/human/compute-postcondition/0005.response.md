The code snippet `x = int(input())` changes the value of `x` to whatever integer the user inputs, ensuring that the new value of `x` satisfies the condition 2 <= x <= 1000. The other variables `t`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `x` is the integer input by the user such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `y` is the integer value of `x // 2` such that 1 <= y <= 500, `i` is `i + 1` where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than `t`**
