Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program always sets `y` to `x // 2` for each test case. While this might work for some inputs, it does not guarantee that the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized for all values of `x`. For example, consider the input `7` where the program outputs `3` (since `7 // 2 = 3`), but the correct output should be `6` because `gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7`, which is the maximum possible sum for `x = 7`. 

To solve the problem correctly, one must iterate through possible values of `y` and calculate `gcd(x, y) + y` to find the maximum value.
