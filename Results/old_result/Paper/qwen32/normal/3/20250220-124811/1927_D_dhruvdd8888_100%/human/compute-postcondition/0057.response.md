Postcondition: **`N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `num` is `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` contains tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`. The condition `e < N or e < l` does not affect the values of the variables as the if and else parts have identical postconditions.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `e < N or e < l` is true or false, the variables retain their specified values as described in the precondition and the identical postconditions of both the if and else parts.
