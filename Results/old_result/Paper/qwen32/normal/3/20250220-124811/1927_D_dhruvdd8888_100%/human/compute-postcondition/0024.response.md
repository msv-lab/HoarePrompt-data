To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's carefully analyze the behavior of the loop and its variables.

The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = N`, and it processes the array `nums` which has `N + 1` elements (including the appended `-1`). The loop checks if the current element `nums[i]` is different from the previous element `num`. If it is different, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr` and updates `s` to the current index `i`. The variable `num` is updated to the current element `nums[i]`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `N` is the length of the array `a`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers with an additional `-1` appended.
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `e` is initialized to 0 (though `e` is not used in the loop).
   - `num` is initialized to `nums[0]`.
   - `arr` is initialized to an empty list.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration `i` from 0 to `N`:
     - If `nums[i]` is different from `num`, it appends the tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr` and updates `s` to `i`.
     - Regardless, `num` is updated to `nums[i]`.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `N`.
   - `s` will be the index of the last element in `nums` that was different from the previous element.
   - `num` will be the last element in `nums`.
   - `arr` will contain tuples representing segments of `nums` where each segment is a contiguous sequence of the same number.

**Output State:**

- `N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`.
- `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes.
- `s` will be the index of the last element in `nums` that was different from the previous element.
- `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1` because `-1` is appended to `nums`.
- `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`.

Output State: **N is the length of the array a, i is N, s is the index of the last element in nums that was different from the previous element, num is -1, arr contains tuples representing segments of nums.**

In simpler terms, the final output state means that the loop has processed all elements of `nums`, and `arr` contains tuples that describe contiguous segments of the same number in `nums`. The variable `s` indicates the starting index of the last segment, and `num` is the last element processed, which is `-1`.
