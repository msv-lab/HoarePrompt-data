The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(-1, -1)
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the two values `-1` and `-1`, separated by a space. The initial state and the variables described do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it explicitly prints the values `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **-1, -1**
