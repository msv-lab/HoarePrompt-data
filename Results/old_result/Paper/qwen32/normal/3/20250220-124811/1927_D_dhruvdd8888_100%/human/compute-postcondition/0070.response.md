Postcondition: **`N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `e` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`; `num` is `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` contains tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are the new values from the input; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`. The condition `if e < N or e < l` does not affect the values of `N`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, or `eli`.**
