The code snippet assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `i` is initially 1, `num` is updated to the value of `nums[1]`. The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, and `arr` remain unchanged unless `nums[i]` is different from the previous `num` (which was `nums[0]`). If `nums[1]` is not equal to `nums[0]`, `s` would be set to 1 and `arr` would be updated to include a new tuple `(1, 1, nums[1])`. However, the code snippet provided does not modify `s` or `arr`; it only updates `num`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer that must be at least 0, `i` is 1, `s` is either 0 or 1, `num` is `nums[1]`, and `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`. If `nums[i]` is equal to `num`, then `s` remains 0 and `arr` is not modified.**
