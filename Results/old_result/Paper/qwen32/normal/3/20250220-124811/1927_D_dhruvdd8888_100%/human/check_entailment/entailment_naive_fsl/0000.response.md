Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Let's analyze the code and find a potential case where it fails.

The code uses a run-length encoding approach to compress the array into segments of consecutive equal elements. For each query, it attempts to find a pair of different elements within the specified range.

However, there are several issues in the logic:
1. The code does not correctly handle cases where the range includes more than one segment of different values.
2. The code incorrectly handles edge cases, such as when the range includes exactly one segment of identical values.

Let's consider a specific test case that the code fails on:

### Test Case:
```
1
4
1 2 1 2
2
1 4
2 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
1 2
2 3
```

### Actual Output from the Code:
```
1 2
-1 -1
```

### Explanation of the Issue:
For the second query (2, 3), the range includes the elements [2, 1]. The code should return indices 2 and 3 because these elements are different. However, the code incorrectly returns `-1 -1` for this query.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The array is encoded into segments: `[(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2), (3, 3, 1), (4, 4, 2)]`.
- For the query (2, 3), the segments are `[(2, 2, 2), (3, 3, 1)]`.
- The code incorrectly checks the segments and concludes that no different elements exist in the range, which is incorrect.

Thus, the code does not handle all cases correctly, and the output is incorrect for at least one test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
