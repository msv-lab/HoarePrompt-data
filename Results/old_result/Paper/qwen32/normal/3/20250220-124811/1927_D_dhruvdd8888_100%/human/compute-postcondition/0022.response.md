Postcondition: **`N` is an integer that must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `s` is either 0 or 2, `num` is `nums[1]`, and `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `s` is 2 and an additional tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])` is appended to `arr`. If `nums[i]` is equal to `num`, then `s` remains 0 and `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` and an additional tuple `(1 + s, 2, nums[1])`.**
