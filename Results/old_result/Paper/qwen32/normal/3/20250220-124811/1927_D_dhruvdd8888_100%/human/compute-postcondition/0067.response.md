The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs two values, both of which are `-1`. The initial state provides information about various variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement itself directly specifies the output values.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement is `print(-1, -1)`.
- This statement explicitly prints the values `-1` and `-1`, separated by a space.

The values of other variables mentioned in the initial state (like `N`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`) do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it directly prints the values `-1` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the two values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
