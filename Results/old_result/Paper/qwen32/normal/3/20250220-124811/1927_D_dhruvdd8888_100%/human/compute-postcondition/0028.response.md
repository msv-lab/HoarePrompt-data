`eli` is assigned the value returned by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, which is the index where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in the sorted list `arr` to maintain order. The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` will be the index of the last element in `nums` that was different from the previous element; `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` will be `len(arr) - 1`; `l` and `r` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input; `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted in `arr`.**
