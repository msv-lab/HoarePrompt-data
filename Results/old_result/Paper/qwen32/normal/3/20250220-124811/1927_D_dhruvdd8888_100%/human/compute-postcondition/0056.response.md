The `print(-1, -1)` statement directly outputs the values `-1` and `-1`, regardless of the values of the other variables (`N`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`, `LA`, `l`, `r`, `eli`) described in the initial state.

Since the `print` statement is explicitly printing `-1, -1`, the output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any other variables in the program.

Output: **-1, -1**
