The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is an integer that must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `N` does not need to be changed, as long as it remains at least 0.

State: **`N` is an integer that must be at least 0, `i` is 2, `s` is either 0 or 1, `num` is `nums[1]`, and `arr` contains the tuple `(1, 1, nums[0])` if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`. If `nums[i]` is equal to `num`, then `s` remains 0 and `arr` is not modified.**
