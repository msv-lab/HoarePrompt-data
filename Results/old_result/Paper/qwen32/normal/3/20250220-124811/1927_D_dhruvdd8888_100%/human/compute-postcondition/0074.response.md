Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array `a`. Then, it takes an integer `q` representing the number of queries. For each query, it receives two integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of the query. The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each query, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information.**
