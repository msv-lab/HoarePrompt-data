You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, it starts with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the array a. The next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), which are the elements of the array a. The following line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the number of queries. Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n) representing the boundaries of the query. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: - `N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`.
    #- `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes.
    #- `s` will be the index of the last element in `nums` that was different from the previous element.
    #- `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1` because `-1` is appended to `nums`.
    #- `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`.
    #
    #Output State:
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1 or s > r:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N or e < l:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: N remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` will be the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` from the last iteration; `e` will be the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` from the last iteration; `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` will be `len(arr) - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array `a`. Then, it takes an integer `q` representing the number of queries. For each query, it receives two integers `l` and `r` representing the boundaries of the query. The function processes these inputs and returns the result for each query, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
