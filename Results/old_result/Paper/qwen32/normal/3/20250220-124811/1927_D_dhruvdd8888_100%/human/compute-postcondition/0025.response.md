The code snippet `LA = len(arr) - 1` assigns the value of `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `LA`. Here, `arr` is a list of tuples representing segments of `nums`. The length of `arr` is not specified but the code calculates the length of `arr` and subtracts 1 from it to get `LA`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`.
- `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes.
- `s` will be the index of the last element in `nums` that was different from the previous element.
- `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1` because `-1` is appended to `nums`.
- `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`.
- `LA` will be `len(arr) - 1`.

Output State: **`N` remains the same as the initial length of the array `a`; `i` will be `N` after the loop finishes; `s` will be the index of the last element in `nums` that was different from the previous element; `num` will be `nums[N]`, which is `-1`; `arr` will contain tuples representing the segments of `nums`; `LA` will be `len(arr) - 1`.**
