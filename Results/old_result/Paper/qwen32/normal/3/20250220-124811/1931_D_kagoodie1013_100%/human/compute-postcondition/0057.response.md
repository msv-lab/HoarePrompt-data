The code snippet `r_x = -num % x` modifies the value of `r_x` by calculating the negative of `num` modulo `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `num` is the next element in `arr`, and `x` is a given value, the expression `-num % x` computes the new value of `r_x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is a dictionary where the key `(num % x, num % y)` has its value incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

In simple terms, `r_x` has been updated to `-num % x`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
