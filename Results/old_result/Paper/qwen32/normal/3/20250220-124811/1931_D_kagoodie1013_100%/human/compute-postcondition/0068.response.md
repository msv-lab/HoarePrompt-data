To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `count` is initialized to 0.
   - `residue_map` is initialized to an empty dictionary.
   - `test_cases` contains tuples of `(n, x, y, arr)` and remains unchanged throughout the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `num` in `arr`, the loop calculates `r_x` and `r_y`.
   - `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.
   - `r_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
   - `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`.
   - `count` is incremented by the value associated with `(r_x, r_y)` in `residue_map`, defaulting to 0 if the key doesn't exist.
   - The `residue_map` is updated to increment the count of `current_key` by 1.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `count` will hold the sum of the values in `residue_map` for each `(r_x, r_y)` encountered.
   - `residue_map` will contain the count of each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in `arr`.

Given the above behavior, after the loop has executed all iterations, the final state will be:

- `test_cases` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain as the values from the current tuple in `test_cases`.
- `count` will be the final sum of all the values in `residue_map` for each `(r_x, r_y)` pair encountered.
- `residue_map` will contain the count of each unique `(num % x, num % y)` pair encountered in `arr`.

**Output State**: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is the final sum of all values in `residue_map` for each `(r_x, r_y)` pair encountered; `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key `(num % x, num % y)` has its value incremented by 1 for each occurrence in `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `count` will reflect the total number of times pairs `(r_x, r_y)` have been encountered, and `residue_map` will show how many times each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` appeared in `arr`. The `test_cases` list and the values `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
