### Reasoning:

The original assessment provided a detailed breakdown of the program and its logic, and it correctly identified the key steps and the use of residues to count beautiful pairs. Let's systematically verify the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Recap:
A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (1 ≤ i < j ≤ n) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It processes each test case by extracting the values of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes a count to zero and a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the residues.
   - It iterates through each number in the array \(a\).
     - For the current number `num`, it calculates:
       - \(r_x = -num \% x\)
       - \(r_y = num \% y\)
     - It checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to the total count.
     - It then updates `residue_map` with the current number's residues \((num \% x, num \% y)\).

3. **Calculating Beautiful Pairs:**
   - The logic for determining if a pair is beautiful is based on the residues:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) implies \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\) or equivalently \(a_i \% x \equiv -a_j \% x \pmod{x}\).
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) implies \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).
   - For each number `num`, the program looks for previous numbers that have residues \((-num \% x, num \% y)\) in the `residue_map`.

#### Verification Using Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` processes each test case by calculating a count based on specific residue conditions and returns a list of these counts. This aligns with the program's logic:
- The function iterates through each number in the array and uses residues to determine if a pair is beautiful.
- It efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary to store and look up residues.

#### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to count beautiful pairs using residues. The use of residues ensures that the program efficiently checks the conditions for a pair to be beautiful in linear time for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the function summary, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

**Final: True**
