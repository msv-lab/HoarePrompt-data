The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect any other variables or their values as mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of integers a of length n, such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each a_i in a. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**
