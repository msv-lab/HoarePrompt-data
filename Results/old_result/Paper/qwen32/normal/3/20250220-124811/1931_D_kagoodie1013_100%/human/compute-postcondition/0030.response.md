The code snippet increments the `count` variable by the value retrieved from `residue_map` using the key `(r_x, r_y)`. If the key does not exist in the dictionary, it defaults to 0. Since `residue_map` is initially empty, the value retrieved will be 0. Therefore, `count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least one element; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is an empty dictionary; `r_x` is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`; `r_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.**
