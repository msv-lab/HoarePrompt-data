The given code snippet only modifies the value of `r_x`. The new value of `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`, where `num` and `x` are already defined in the initial state. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` has the key `(first_element % x, first_element % y)` with its value incremented by 1 and the key `current_key` with its value incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[2] % x, arr[2] % y)`; `num` is `arr[2]`.**
