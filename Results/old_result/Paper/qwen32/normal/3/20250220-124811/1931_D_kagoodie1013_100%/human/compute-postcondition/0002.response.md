Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `x` (an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `y` (an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and `arr` (a list of `n` integers, each integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `test_cases` must have at least one tuple; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `count` has been initialized to 0, while `test_cases` and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states.
