Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array according to the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`. This is done correctly by splitting the input string and mapping the values appropriately.

2. **Logic for Finding Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the number of pairs `(num % x, num % y)` encountered so far.
   - For each number `num` in the array, it calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`. The reason for using `-num % x` is to ensure that the condition `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` when combined with the stored residues.
   - It then checks if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` exists in `residue_map`. If it does, it means there are numbers previously encountered that can form a beautiful pair with the current number, so it adds the count of such pairs to the total count.
   - It updates `residue_map` with the current number's residues `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. It efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary to store and look up residues, which ensures that the solution works within the given constraints.

Since the program correctly handles the input, logic, and output as per the problem description, it is correct for all potential cases.
