The code snippet updates the value of `current_key` to a new tuple `(num % x, num % y)`. This change does not affect the other variables in the initial state, as they are not modified by the given code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`; `residue_map` is a dictionary where the key `(num % x, num % y)` has its value incremented by 1; `r_x` is `-num % x`; `r_y` is `num % y`; `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
