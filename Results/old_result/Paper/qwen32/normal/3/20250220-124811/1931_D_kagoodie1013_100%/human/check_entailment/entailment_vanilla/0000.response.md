To determine if the provided Python program is correct, let's analyze the logic and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding pairs of indices (i, j) in the array `a` such that:
1. `a[i] + a[j]` is divisible by `x`.
2. `a[i] - a[j]` is divisible by `y`.

### Key Observations

1. **Divisibility Check**:
   - For `a[i] + a[j]` to be divisible by `x`, `(a[i] % x) + (a[j] % x)` must be divisible by `x`. This can be rephrased as `(a[i] % x) == - (a[j] % x) % x` or `(a[i] % x) == (x - (a[j] % x)) % x` for non-negative values.
   - For `a[i] - a[j]` to be divisible by `y`, `(a[i] % y) == (a[j] % y)`.

2. **Efficient Counting**:
   - We need to efficiently count pairs that satisfy the above conditions. A hashmap (dictionary in Python) can be used to store the remainders modulo `x` and `y` to avoid a quadratic time complexity.

### Program Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to store pairs of remainders `(a[i] % x, a[i] % y)` and their counts.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and for each element `num`:
     - Computes `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`.
     - Looks up the count of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` in the `residue_map` and adds this count to the total `count` of beautiful pairs.
     - Updates the `residue_map` with the current pair `(num % x, num % y)`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program outputs the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Correctness Verification

- **Modulo Arithmetic**: The use of `-num % x` ensures that the remainder is non-negative, which is essential for correct dictionary lookups.
- **Efficiency**: The time complexity of the program is O(n) per test case, where n is the length of the array. Given the constraints, this is efficient enough.
- **Logic**: The logic for counting beautiful pairs using a hashmap is correct based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
