Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of integers a of length n, such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each a_i in a. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    residue_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        r_x = -num % x
        r_y = num % y
        count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
        current_key = num % x, num % y
        residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is incremented by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each element in `arr`; `residue_map` has keys for each unique pair `(num % x, num % y)` with their values representing the number of occurrences of each pair in `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is the total number of times a specific pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before; `residue_map` is a dictionary with each residue pair `(num % x, num % y)` mapped to the number of times it has been encountered.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with at least one more tuple remaining; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values from the next tuple in `test_cases` such that `arr` has at least one element; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the newly appended value of `count`; `count` is the accumulated sum of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each element in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key `(num % x, num % y)` has its value incremented by 1 for each occurrence of that residue pair in `arr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
