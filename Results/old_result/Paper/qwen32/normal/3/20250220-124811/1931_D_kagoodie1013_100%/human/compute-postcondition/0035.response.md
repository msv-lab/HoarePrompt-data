The code snippet provided updates the value of `r_y` to be the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. Given that `num` is `arr[1]`, the new value of `r_y` will be `arr[1] % y`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` with `arr` having at least one element; `results` is a list containing the current value of `count`; `count` is 0; `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`; `r_x` is the remainder of `-arr[1]` divided by `x`; `r_y` is `arr[1] % y`; `current_key` is `(arr[1] % x, arr[1] % y)`; `num` is `arr[1]`.**
