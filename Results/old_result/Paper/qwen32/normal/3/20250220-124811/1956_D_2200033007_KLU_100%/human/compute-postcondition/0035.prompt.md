You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the length of the array arr. start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, and arr is a list of integers. res is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: `is_already_stairs` is `True` if `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` from `0` to `i`; otherwise, `is_already_stairs` is `False`.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns nothing (None)
    #State: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, meaning there exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`. All other conditions related to `is_already_stairs` as defined in the precondition are retained.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, meaning there exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `0`. All other conditions related to `is_already_stairs` as defined in the precondition are retained.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are all set to `i`, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `start_index` and `i` remain unchanged.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, meaning there exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `0`. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are all set to `i`, `is_already_stairs` remains `False`, `start_index` and `i` remain unchanged, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `make_stairs` accepts an integer `i` such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the length of the array `arr`. It also implicitly uses `start_index`, an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, and `res`, a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed. The function does not return anything (None) in all cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing (None)

Case_2: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
