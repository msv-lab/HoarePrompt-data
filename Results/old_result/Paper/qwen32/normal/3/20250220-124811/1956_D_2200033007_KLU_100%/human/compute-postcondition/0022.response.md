Postcondition: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, meaning there exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `0`. Furthermore, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. All other conditions related to `is_already_stairs` as defined in the precondition are retained.**
