Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing an operation that sets a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded non-negative integer) of that subarray. The goal is to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1`: Computes the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
2. `func_2`: Constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
3. `make_stairs`: A helper function to make a subarray into a "staircase" pattern (i.e., [0, 1, 2, ..., i-1, i]).

#### Function `func_1`
- This function uses memoization to store results for subarrays to avoid redundant calculations.
- It considers different ways to split the subarray and calculates the maximum sum by either:
  - Setting the entire subarray to its MEX.
  - Preserving the first or last element and optimizing the rest of the subarray.
- The maximum sum for a subarray of length `l` is `l^2` if the subarray can be set to a staircase pattern.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function reconstructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
- It uses the results from `func_1` to decide how to split the subarray and recursively constructs the operations.
- It handles the case when the maximum sum is achieved by setting the entire subarray to its MEX.

#### Function `make_stairs`
- This function modifies the array to form a staircase pattern.
- It checks if the subarray is already in a staircase pattern. If not, it performs operations to transform it into one.

### Issues and Correctness

1. **Global Variables and Scope**: The program uses global variables like `res_dict`, `arr`, `res`, and `start_index` without defining them within the functions. This can lead to undefined behavior and is not a good practice.
2. **Memoization**: The memoization in `func_1` is correct, but the use of global variables makes it hard to track and debug.
3. **Operation Construction**: The `func_2` function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations, but it doesn't correctly handle the construction of operations when the maximum sum is achieved by setting the entire subarray to its MEX.
4. **Staircase Construction**: The `make_stairs` function is supposed to transform a subarray into a staircase pattern, but it doesn't correctly update the global `res` list of operations.

### Conclusion

The program has several issues related to global variable usage and the correctness of the operation construction. These issues can lead to incorrect results and are not aligned with good programming practices.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
