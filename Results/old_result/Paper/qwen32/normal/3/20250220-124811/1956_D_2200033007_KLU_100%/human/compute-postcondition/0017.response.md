The code snippet `arr[start_index] = 1` sets the element at `start_index` in the array `arr` to the value `1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `is_already_stairs` is `False`
- `res` contains `[(start_index, start_index)]`, meaning there exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`

After executing the code, the value at `arr[start_index]` is updated to `1`. The values of `i`, `is_already_stairs`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `res` contains `[(start_index, start_index)]`, `arr[start_index]` is 1**.
