The code snippet sets `is_already_stairs` to `False`. This change affects only the `is_already_stairs` variable, while all other variables retain their original values and conditions.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed, `j` is `i + 1`. If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then `is_already_stairs` is False. Otherwise, `is_already_stairs` retains its original value. `is_already_stairs` is False.**
