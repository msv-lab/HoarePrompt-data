Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `arr` is a list of integers with n > 0, `res` is a list that will store tuples representing the operations performed, `is_already_stairs` is False, `j` is `i + 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `is_already_stairs` has been explicitly set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
