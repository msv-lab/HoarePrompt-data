### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their behavior in the context of the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum for a subarray defined by `start_index` and `end_index`.
   - It uses memoization to store results of previously computed subarrays in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The function considers different ways to partition the subarray and calculates the maximum sum based on the MEX operation.
   - The base case handles single-element subarrays, and the recursive case handles multi-element subarrays by considering partitions and their respective sums.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function determines the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It handles different cases, including single-element subarrays and multi-element subarrays.
   - For multi-element subarrays, it identifies the optimal partition that leads to the maximum sum and recursively determines the operations for the subarrays.
   - It returns a list of tuples representing the indices of the operations performed.

3. **Function `make_stairs`**:
   - This function modifies the array to form a "staircase" pattern from `start_index` to `start_index + i`.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in a staircase pattern. If not, it performs the necessary operations to achieve the pattern.
   - It appends the operations performed to the list `res`.

### Issues in the Implementation:

- **Variable `start_index` in `make_stairs`**:
  - The function `make_stairs` uses a variable `start_index` that is not defined within the scope of the function. This variable is likely intended to be passed as a parameter or defined in a higher scope, but it is not present in the provided code.
  - This will result in a `NameError` when the function is called.

### Correctness:

Given the identified issue with the `start_index` variable in `make_stairs`, the program is not correct as it will not execute without errors. Therefore, the correctness of the program based on the provided code and the problem description is:

**Correctness: False**
