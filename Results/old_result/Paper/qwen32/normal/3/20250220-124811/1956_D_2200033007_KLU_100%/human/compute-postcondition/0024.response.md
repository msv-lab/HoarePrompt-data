The code snippet appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to the list `res`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, meaning there exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `0`. Furthermore, `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been executed. The list `res` now contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.**
