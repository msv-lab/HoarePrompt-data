### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its components to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing an operation that sets a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded non-negative integer) of that subarray. The goal is to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

#### Program Analysis

The program consists of three functions:
1. **`func_1`**: Computes the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
2. **`func_2`**: Constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
3. **`make_stairs`**: A helper function to make a subarray into a "staircase" pattern (i.e., [0, 1, 2, ..., i-1, i]).

#### Function `func_1`
- This function uses memoization to store results for subarrays to avoid redundant calculations.
- It considers different ways to split the subarray and calculates the maximum sum by either:
  - Setting the entire subarray to its MEX.
  - Preserving the first or last element and optimizing the rest of the subarray.
- The maximum sum for a subarray of length `l` is `l^2` if the subarray can be set to a staircase pattern.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function reconstructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
- It uses the results from `func_1` to decide how to split the subarray and recursively constructs the operations.
- It handles the case when the maximum sum is achieved by setting the entire subarray to its MEX.

#### Function `make_stairs`
- This function modifies the array to form a staircase pattern.
- It checks if the subarray is already in a staircase pattern. If not, it performs operations to transform it into one.

### Issues and Correctness

1. **Global Variables and Scope**: 
   - The program uses global variables like `res_dict`, `arr`, `res`, and `start_index` without defining them within the functions. This can lead to undefined behavior and is not a good practice.
   - The use of global variables makes it hard to track and debug the program.

2. **Memoization**:
   - The memoization in `func_1` is correct, but the use of global variables makes it hard to track and debug.

3. **Operation Construction**:
   - The `func_2` function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations, but it doesn't correctly handle the construction of operations when the maximum sum is achieved by setting the entire subarray to its MEX.
   - The logic in `func_2` to construct operations is incomplete and may not correctly reflect the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Staircase Construction**:
   - The `make_stairs` function is supposed to transform a subarray into a staircase pattern, but it doesn't correctly update the global `res` list of operations.
   - The function modifies the array but does not ensure that the operations are correctly recorded.

### Detailed Evaluation

Let's consider a few specific issues with the program:

- **Global Variables**: The use of global variables can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if `arr` or `res` is modified in one function, it can affect the behavior of other functions.
- **Operation Construction**: The logic in `func_2` to construct operations when the maximum sum is achieved by setting the entire subarray to its MEX is incomplete. It does not correctly append the necessary operations to `res`.
- **Staircase Construction**: The `make_stairs` function correctly modifies the array to form a staircase pattern but does not correctly append the operations to `res`.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with global variables and the incomplete logic in `func_2` and `make_stairs`, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The operations constructed may not be accurate, and the maximum sum may not be achieved correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
