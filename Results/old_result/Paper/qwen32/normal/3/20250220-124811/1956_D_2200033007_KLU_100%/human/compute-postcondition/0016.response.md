The code snippet appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to the list `res`. The variables `i` and `is_already_stairs` are not affected by this operation. The precondition regarding `is_already_stairs` remains valid, meaning there still exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `is_already_stairs` is `False`, `res` contains `[(start_index, start_index)]`, meaning there exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`.**
