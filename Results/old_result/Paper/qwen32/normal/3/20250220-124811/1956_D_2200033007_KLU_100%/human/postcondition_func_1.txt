The function `func_2` takes two integer parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which define a segment of an array `arr`. It returns a list of tuples representing indices of the array that meet certain criteria based on the maximum value calculated within the segment. The function handles different cases, including returning an empty list, a single tuple, or recursively combining results from subsegments.
