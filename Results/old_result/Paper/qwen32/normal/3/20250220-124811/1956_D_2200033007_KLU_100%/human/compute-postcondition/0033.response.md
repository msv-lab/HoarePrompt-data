Postcondition: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, meaning there exists at least one `j` from `0` to `i` such that `arr[start_index + j] != j`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to `0`. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, `arr[start_index]` to `arr[start_index + i]` are all set to `i`, `is_already_stairs` remains `False`, `start_index` and `i` remain unchanged, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.**
