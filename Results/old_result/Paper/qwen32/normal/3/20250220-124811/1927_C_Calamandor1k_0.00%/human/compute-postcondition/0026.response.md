The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `max(len_a, len_b)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to adjust `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1
- `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1
- `count_a` and `count_b` are incremented based on the conditions provided
- `i` is incremented by 1

Since `i` is the only variable that can be adjusted in the loop head, we increment `i` by 1 for the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1; `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1; `i` is incremented by 1**
