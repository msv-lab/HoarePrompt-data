Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element or `b` must have at least 1 element; `b` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element or `a` must have at least 1 element; `len_a` is the length of the new list `a`; `len_b` is the length of the new list `b`. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, `count_a` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_a` remains unchanged. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, `count_b` is 1 if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `count_b` remains 0. If `len_b` is greater than `i + 1` and `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1. `d` is `k // 2`. `i` is `i + 1`. If `len_a` is not greater than `i + 1`, `count_a` and `count_b` remain unchanged, `d` is `k // 2`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
