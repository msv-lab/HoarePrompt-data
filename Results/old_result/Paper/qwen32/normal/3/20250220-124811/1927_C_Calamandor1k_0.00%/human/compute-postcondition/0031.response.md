Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1; `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1; `i` is incremented by 1. If `len_a` is greater than `i + 1` and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is incremented by 1. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1.**
