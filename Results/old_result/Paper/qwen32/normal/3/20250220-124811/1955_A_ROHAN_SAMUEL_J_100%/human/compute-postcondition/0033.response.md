Output State: **t is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4; all t test cases have been processed. For each test case, the values of n, a, and b were read from the input, and the output was determined based on the conditions specified in the loop: if n is odd and 2 * a < b, the output was a * n; otherwise, the output was n // 2 * b + a if n is odd, or n // 2 * b if n is even.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` were used to determine the output according to the given conditions. The value of `t` is now 0 (or the loop has ended), and all test cases have been evaluated and their results printed.
