To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the expression `n // 2 * b + a` based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The current value of `n` is odd.
- It is not the case that \(2 \cdot a < b\), which means \(2 \cdot a \geq b\).

### Expression Breakdown:
The expression to be evaluated is `n // 2 * b + a`.

1. **Integer Division (`n // 2`)**:
   - Since `n` is odd, dividing `n` by 2 using integer division (`//`) will result in the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`. For example, if `n` is 5, `n // 2` will be 2.

2. **Multiplication (`(n // 2) * b`)**:
   - Multiply the result of the integer division by `b`. For example, if `n // 2` is 2 and `b` is 3, then `(n // 2) * b` will be 6.

3. **Addition (`(n // 2) * b + a`)**:
   - Add the result of the multiplication to `a`. For example, if `(n // 2) * b` is 6 and `a` is 4, then the final result will be 10.

### Putting it all together:
Given that `n` is odd, the value of `n // 2` will be an integer. The exact value of `n // 2` depends on the specific value of `n`, but it will always be the integer part of `n / 2`.

The expression `n // 2 * b + a` will compute the final value based on the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(n // 2) * b + a (where n is an odd integer, a and b are integers such that 2 * a >= b)**
