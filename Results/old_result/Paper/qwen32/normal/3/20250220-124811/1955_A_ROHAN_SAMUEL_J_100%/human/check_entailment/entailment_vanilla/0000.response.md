Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine the correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem revolves around calculating the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given the following conditions:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts under promotion is `b` burles.

The objective is to find the minimum cost for different values of `n`, `a`, and `b` across multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis
The provided program iterates over the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Then, it checks if `n` is odd or even and calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:
- If `n` is odd:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper than the promotion, so the cost is `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible and paying `a` for the last yogurt).
- If `n` is even:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper than the promotion, so the cost is `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, the cost is `n // 2 * b` (buying pairs of yogurts).

### Verification Against Example
Let's verify the program logic against the provided example:

1. **Input:** `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
   - **Output:** `9` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Output:** `14` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the program calculates the cost as `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
   - **Output:** `15` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the program calculates the cost as `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
   - **Output:** `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. It handles both even and odd values of `n` and compares the cost of buying individual yogurts versus buying pairs under promotion.

**Correctness:** **True**
