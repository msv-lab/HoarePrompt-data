To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `n` is an even integer.
- `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of what will be printed:

1. `n // 2` computes the integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is an even integer, this operation will yield an integer result.
2. The result of `n // 2` is then multiplied by `b`.

Therefore, the output will be the product of half of `n` (integer division) and `b`.

Given the information, we can describe the output as:
Output: **(n // 2) * b (where n is an even integer and b is an integer)**

This is the most precise description possible based on the provided initial state.
