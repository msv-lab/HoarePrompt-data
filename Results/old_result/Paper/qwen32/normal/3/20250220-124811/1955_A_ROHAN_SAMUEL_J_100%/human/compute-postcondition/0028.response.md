Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. The relationship between `2 * a` and `b` remains unchanged regardless of whether `n` is odd or even. If `2 * a < b`, then the actions specified in the if part are taken; otherwise, the actions specified in the else part are taken. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are consistent with the precondition, and the relationship between `2 * a` and `b` is preserved.**
