The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, the function receives three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, with constraints `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30`.

The functionality of the function is:
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
