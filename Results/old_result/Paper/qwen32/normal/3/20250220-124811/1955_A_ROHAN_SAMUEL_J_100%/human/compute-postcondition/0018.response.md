Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\). The value of `t` is not used in the given code snippet.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The conditions provided for `n`, `a`, and `b` do not affect the calculation in the print statement. They are just additional constraints that do not change the arithmetic expression being evaluated.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(n // 2 * b + a)
```

### Explanation:
- `n // 2`: This is the integer division of `n` by 2, which means it will yield the largest integer less than or equal to the result of `n / 2`.
- `n // 2 * b`: This multiplies the result of the integer division by `b`.
- `n // 2 * b + a`: Finally, `a` is added to the result of the multiplication.

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`.

Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n, a, and b are integers read from the input)**
