### Reasoning:
The program aims to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The program processes multiple test cases and calculates the cost based on whether `n` is odd or even and the relative values of `2 * a` and `b`.

1. **Even `n`**: 
   - If `n` is even, the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts in pairs, as long as the promotion price `b` is less than or equal to `2 * a`. 
   - The program correctly calculates this as `n // 2 * b`.

2. **Odd `n`**:
   - If `n` is odd, Maxim can buy `n-1` yogurts in pairs and the last one at the regular price.
   - If `2 * a` is less than `b`, it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually, resulting in a total cost of `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy `n-1` yogurts in pairs and the last one individually, resulting in a total cost of `n // 2 * b + a`.

The execution summary aligns with the logic described above. The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and compares `2 * a` with `b` to determine the optimal purchasing strategy.
