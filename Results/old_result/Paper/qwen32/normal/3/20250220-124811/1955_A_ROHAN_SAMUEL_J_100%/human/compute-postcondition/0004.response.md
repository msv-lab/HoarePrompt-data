To determine what will be printed by the `print(a * n)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state step by step:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is mentioned that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the result of the `print` statement.

2. **Variables `n`, `a`, and `b`**: These are integers read from the input. The problem specifies that the current value of `n` is odd, and the current value of `2 * a` is less than `b`. 

   - `n` is an odd integer.
   - `a` is an integer such that \(2a < b\).

3. **Expression `a * n`**: The expression `a * n` involves multiplying the integer `a` by the odd integer `n`. The result of this multiplication will be an integer.

Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified, we cannot compute a numerical value for `a * n`. However, based on the given conditions, we can describe the output in terms of `a` and `n`.

The `print` statement will output the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where `a` is an integer such that 2a < b, and `n` is an odd integer)**
