You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on whether `n` is odd or even and the relative values of `2 * a` and `b`. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it outputs `a * n`. Otherwise, it outputs `n // 2 * b + a` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2 * b` if `n` is even.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The promotion price for two yogurts is `b` burles.
- The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each test case and calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:
- If `n` is odd, it checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`b`) is cheaper than buying them individually (`2 * a`). If it is, it buys as many pairs as possible and pays for the remaining single yogurt at the regular price. Otherwise, it buys all yogurts at the regular price.
- If `n` is even, it performs a similar check and then buys all yogurts in pairs if the promotion price is cheaper, or individually otherwise.

### Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Verification:
1. **Odd `n`**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **Even `n`**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`.
   - If `2 * a >= b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b`.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- `n = 1`: The program correctly calculates `a * n` since `n` is odd.
- `n = 2`: The program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b` if `2 * a >= b`, or `a * n` if `2 * a < b`.
- `n = 3`: The program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b + a` if `2 * a >= b`, or `a * n` if `2 * a < b`.
- `n = 100`: The program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b` if `2 * a >= b`, or `a * n` if `2 * a < b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs as per the problem description. It calculates the minimum cost accurately for all values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if buying yogurts in pairs (using the promotion) is cheaper than buying them individually and calculates the minimum cost accordingly for both odd and even values of `n`.
