The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This changes the initial state by defining specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `n` is odd, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `n` is even, then if `2 * a` is less than `b`, `2 * a` is less than `b`; otherwise, `2 * a` is greater than or equal to `b`.**

In simpler terms, `t` remains unchanged, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are now assigned the values read from the input. The conditions regarding the relationship between `n`, `a`, and `b` still hold.
