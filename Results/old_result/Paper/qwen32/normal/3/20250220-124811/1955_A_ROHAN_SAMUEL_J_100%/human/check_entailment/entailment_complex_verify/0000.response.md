### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program logic and verify it against the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It checks if `n` is odd or even.
     - If `n` is odd:
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts individually is cheaper than the promotion, so it buys all `n` yogurts individually: `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it buys as many pairs as possible (`n // 2` pairs) and pays for the remaining single yogurt at the regular price: `n // 2 * b + a`.
     - If `n` is even:
       - If `2 * a < b`, it buys all `n` yogurts individually: `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it buys all yogurts in pairs: `n // 2 * b`.

2. **Verification**:
   - **Odd `n`**:
     - If `2 * a < b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - **Even `n`**:
     - If `2 * a < b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `a * n`.
     - If `2 * a >= b`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - `n = 1`: The program correctly calculates `a * n` since `n` is odd.
   - `n = 2`: The program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b` if `2 * a >= b`, or `a * n` if `2 * a < b`.
   - `n = 3`: The program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b + a` if `2 * a >= b`, or `a * n` if `2 * a < b`.
   - `n = 100`: The program correctly calculates `n // 2 * b` if `2 * a >= b`, or `a * n` if `2 * a < b`.

4. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after processing each test case.
   - The annotations confirm that the program handles both odd and even values of `n` correctly based on the conditions specified.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs as per the problem description. It calculates the minimum cost accurately for all values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the given constraints.

**Final: True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
