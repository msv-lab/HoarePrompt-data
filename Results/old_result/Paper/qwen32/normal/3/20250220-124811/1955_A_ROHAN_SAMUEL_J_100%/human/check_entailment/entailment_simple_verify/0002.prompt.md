You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.

    #State: t is an integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4; all t test cases have been processed. For each test case, the values of n, a, and b were read from the input, and the output was determined based on the conditions specified in the loop: if n is odd and 2 * a < b, the output was a * n; otherwise, the output was n // 2 * b + a if n is odd, or n // 2 * b if n is even.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine the correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem revolves around calculating the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given the following conditions:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts under promotion is `b` burles.

The objective is to find the minimum cost for different values of `n`, `a`, and `b` across multiple test cases.

### Program Analysis
The provided program iterates over the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Then, it checks if `n` is odd or even and calculates the minimum cost based on the following logic:
- If `n` is odd:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper than the promotion, so the cost is `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible and paying `a` for the last yogurt).
- If `n` is even:
  - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying individual yogurts is cheaper than the promotion, so the cost is `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, the cost is `n // 2 * b` (buying pairs of yogurts).

### Verification Against Example
Let's verify the program logic against the provided example:

1. **Input:** `n = 2, a = 5, b = 9`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
   - **Output:** `9` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 > b = 9`, the program calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - **Output:** `14` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `n = 3, a = 5, b = 11`
   - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the program calculates the cost as `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
   - **Output:** `15` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11`
   - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 < b = 11`, the program calculates the cost as `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
   - **Output:** `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. It handles both even and odd values of `n` and compares the cost of buying individual yogurts versus buying pairs under promotion.

**Correctness:** **True**
