Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.
- **Prices**:
  - One yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts cost `b` burles under promotion.
- **Constraints**:
  - `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`
  - `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30`
  - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` test cases.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates over each test case and calculates the minimum cost based on the value of `n` and the prices `a` and `b`.

#### Logic Breakdown:
1. **If `n` is odd**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Therefore, the cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper (or equally priced) to buy pairs of yogurts. Since `n` is odd, Maxim buys `n // 2` pairs and one yogurt individually. Thus, the cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

2. **If `n` is even**:
   - If `2 * a < b`, it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Therefore, the cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper (or equally priced) to buy pairs of yogurts. Since `n` is even, Maxim buys `n // 2` pairs. Thus, the cost is `n // 2 * b`.

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the program's state correctly:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It then applies the logic to calculate the minimum cost based on the conditions described above.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic and edge cases with the annotations:

1. **Odd `n`**:
   - **Case**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
     - Expected cost: `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
     - Program calculates: `14` (Correct).
   - **Case**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
     - Expected cost: `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
     - Program calculates: `15` (Correct).

2. **Even `n`**:
   - **Case**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
     - Expected cost: `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
     - Program calculates: `9` (Correct).
   - **Case**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
     - Expected cost: `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
     - Program calculates: `20` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and potential inputs as per the problem description. It accurately calculates the minimum cost for all values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the given constraints.

**Final Evaluation**: Final: **True**
