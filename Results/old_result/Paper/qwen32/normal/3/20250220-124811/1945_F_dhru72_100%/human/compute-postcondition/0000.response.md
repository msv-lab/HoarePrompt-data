The provided code snippet only defines a type variable `T` using `TypeVar`. This has no impact on the values of `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `v`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case consists of three parts: an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000) representing the number of mushrooms, an array `v` of size `n` (1 ≤ `v_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and a permutation `p` of numbers from 1 to `n`. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
