Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `y` is equal to `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans` has been increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
