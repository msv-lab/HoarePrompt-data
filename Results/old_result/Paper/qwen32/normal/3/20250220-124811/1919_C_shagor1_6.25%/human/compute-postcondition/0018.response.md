The code snippet `x = a` directly assigns the value of `a` to `x`. This means that the value of `x` is now equal to the value of `a`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `a`, `y` is `n + 1` if `a > x` else `y` is `a` if `a <= y` else `y` remains `n + 1`, `ans` is 0 if `a <= y` else `ans` is 1, `a` is the next element in the list `inp`**.
