Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0; `a` is less than or equal to `y`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be equal to `a`. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions as described.
