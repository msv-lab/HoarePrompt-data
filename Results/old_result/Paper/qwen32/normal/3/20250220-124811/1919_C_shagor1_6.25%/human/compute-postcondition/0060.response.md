The only object in the loop head is the variable `a`, which iterates over the list `inp`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the next element in `inp` that `a` will take.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element.
- `a` is the next element in `inp`.
- If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is updated to the value of `a`.
- Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `a`, and if `a` is greater than `y`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` has taken on the value of the current element in `inp`. For the next iteration, `a` must take on the value of the next element in `inp`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `a` is the next element in `inp` (which is the current element's successor in the list)**.

To be more precise, if `a` was the `k`-th element in `inp` during the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `a` will be the `(k+1)`-th element in `inp`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `a` is the next element in `inp` (the successor of the current `a` in the list)**.
