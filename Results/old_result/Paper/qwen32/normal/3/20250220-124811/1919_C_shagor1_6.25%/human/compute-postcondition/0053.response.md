The variable `x` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `inp` remain unchanged. Since `a` is the next element in the list `inp`, `x` now holds that specific value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `inp` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is the value of `a`.**
