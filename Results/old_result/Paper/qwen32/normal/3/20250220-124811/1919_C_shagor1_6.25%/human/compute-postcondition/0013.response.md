The code snippet assigns the value of `a` to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `inp` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element; `x` is `n + 1`; `y` is `a`; `ans` is 0; `a` is greater than `x` and `a` is greater than `y`.**

In natural language, this means:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `n` retains its value as an input integer.
- `inp` remains a list of integers with at least one element.
- `x` remains `n + 1`.
- `y` is now equal to `a`.
- `ans` remains 0.
- `a` is still greater than both `x` and `y`.
