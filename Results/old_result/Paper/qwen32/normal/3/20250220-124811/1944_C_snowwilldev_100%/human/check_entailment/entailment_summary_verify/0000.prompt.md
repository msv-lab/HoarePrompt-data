You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `a`. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list. The function returns the smallest integer `i` such that `i` either has zero occurrences or at least two integers in the list have exactly one occurrence each.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Optimal Play**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The program simply counts the occurrences of each number and returns the smallest number that either appears once or does not appear at all. This does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

2. **Key Flaw**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It directly computes the MEX based on the counts of elements without considering the order in which elements are chosen.
   - For example, in the first test case:
     ```
     4
     0 0 1 1
     ```
     The program will return `2` because `0` and `1` both appear twice, and `2` is the smallest number not appearing. However, the correct strategy involves Alice and Bob making choices that affect the final MEX. In this case, Alice can ensure that `2` is the MEX by playing optimally.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     4
     0 0 1 2
     ```
     The optimal play could be:
     - Alice picks `2`, `c = [2]`, `a = [0, 0, 1]`.
     - Bob picks `0`, `c = [2]`, `a = [0, 1]`.
     - Alice picks `1`, `c = [2, 1]`, `a = [0]`.
     - Bob picks `0`, `c = [2, 1]`, `a = []`.
     - The MEX of `c` is `0`, not `2` as the program would output.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the game and does not account for the strategic decisions made by Alice and Bob. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect for the given problem description, and the Correctness is **False**.
