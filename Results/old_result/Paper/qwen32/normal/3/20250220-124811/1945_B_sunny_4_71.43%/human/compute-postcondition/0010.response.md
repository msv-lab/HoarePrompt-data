To determine the output of the `print(A + B)` statement, we need to carefully evaluate the values of `A` and `B` based on the provided initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: It is mentioned that `t` is `t - 1` from the previous iteration, but its current value is not specified. However, `t` is not used in the `print(A + B)` statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **`a`, `b`, and `m`**: These are integers read from the input. Their specific values are not provided, but we know they are integers.
3. **`A`**: Calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`. This means `A` is the integer division of `m` by `a`, plus one.
4. **`B`**: Calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`. This means `B` is the integer division of `m` by `b`, plus one.

### Calculating `A` and `B`:
- `A = int(m / a) + 1`
- `B = int(m / b) + 1`

### Summing `A` and `B`:
The expression `A + B` can be described as:
\[ A + B = (int(m / a) + 1) + (int(m / b) + 1) \]
\[ A + B = int(m / a) + int(m / b) + 2 \]

### Output Description:
The `print(A + B)` statement will output the sum of `A` and `B`, which is the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `m` by `b`, each incremented by one.

### Final Output:
Output: **int(m / a) + int(m / b) + 2 (where `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input)**
