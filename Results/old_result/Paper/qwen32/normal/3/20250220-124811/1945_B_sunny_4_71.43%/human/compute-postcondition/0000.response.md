The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial state mentions that `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers representing the frequency of launching fireworks and the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky. After the code snippet is executed, the value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers representing the frequency of launching fireworks and the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky.**
