The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `B` to `int(m / b) + 1`. Since `B` was already defined with the same expression in the initial state, the value of `B` remains unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `B` retains its previously defined value.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `A` is an integer equal to `int(m / a) + 1`; `B` is an integer equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**
