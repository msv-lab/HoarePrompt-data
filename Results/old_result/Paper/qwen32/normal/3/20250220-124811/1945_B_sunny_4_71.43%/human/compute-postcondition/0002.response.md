The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers representing the frequency of launching fireworks and the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky. After executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be updated based on the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.**
