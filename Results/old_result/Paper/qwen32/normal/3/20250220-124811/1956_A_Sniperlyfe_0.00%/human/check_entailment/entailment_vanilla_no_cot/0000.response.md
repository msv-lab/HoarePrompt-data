Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Output Handling**: The `print` statement inside the loop for each test case is incorrect. The program prints the results after processing each `n` in `qs`, which means it will print partial results. It should print the results only after processing all `n` values for a particular test case.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` is not entirely correct. The function is supposed to simulate the rounds of the game where players are kicked out based on the positions specified in `p`. The current implementation subtracts the count of players that can be kicked out in each round from `n` until no more players can be kicked out. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where players are skipped if their positions exceed the current number of players remaining.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        kicked = set()
        for pos in p:
            if pos - 1 < len(players):
                kicked.add(players[pos - 1])
        if not kicked:
            break
        players = [player for player in players if player not in kicked]
    return len(players)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

func_2()
```

In this corrected version:
- `func_1` simulates the game by maintaining a list of players and removing the players at the specified positions in each round until no more players can be removed.
- The results for all `n` values in `qs` are collected in `res` and printed only once after processing all `n` values for a particular test case.
