The code snippet provided updates the `qs` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into components, and converting each component to an integer. This affects the `qs` variable but does not impact the other variables (`res`, `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`) directly.

Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is a list containing `len(qs)` elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`; `t` remains unchanged; `k` is the first input integer; `q` is the second input integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

In simple terms, `qs` is now a list of integers from the input, while all other variables retain their previous values.
