The code snippet takes two integers as input and assigns them to `k` and `q`. The initial state of `res` and `t` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing `len(qs)` elements, each being the output of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`; `t` remains unchanged; `k` is the first input integer; `q` is the second input integer.**
