### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the execution summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

2. **Special Case Handling (`n == 1`):**
   - The program correctly identifies that it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string of uppercase letters. This is because a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. With only one character, it cannot have a neighbor, hence there can't be a special character. Therefore, it prints "NO" for `n == 1`.

3. **Constructing the String (`n > 1`):**
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string by repeating each letter twice. This ensures that each pair of repeated letters contributes two special characters (the first and the last of each pair). For example, for `n = 6`, the string "AAABAACC" has special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with "AAA" and then proceeds to add pairs of letters. This ensures that the first letter 'A' is a special character (since it is equal to its next neighbor), and each subsequent pair contributes two special characters. For example, for `n = 3`, the string "AAA" has special characters at positions 1 and 3.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if a suitable string can be formed.
   - The program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly as per the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly handles all edge cases and scenarios. It ensures that the constructed string meets the criteria of having exactly `n` special characters.

**Correctness: **True**
