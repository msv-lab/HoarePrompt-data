Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 4, `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `i` is 2, `ans` is "AABBCC", `x` is 2, `j` is 2.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been updated to "AABBCC" by appending the character at index `x` (which is 2, corresponding to 'C') twice to its original value. All other variables retain their initial values.
