Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is 2. If `n` was initially 6, `ans` is "AABBCC" and `x` is 3. If `n` was initially 7, `ans` is "AAABBCCDD" and `x` is 4. If `n` was initially an odd integer at least 7, `ans` is "AAABBCCDD", `x` is 4, and `j` is 2. If `n` is not 1, then `n` is either 6 or 7.**
