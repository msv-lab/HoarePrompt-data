The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends two characters to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 2 and `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", `s[x]` is "C". Therefore, `s[x] * 2` is "CC". This is then concatenated to `ans`, which initially is 'AAABB'. After the operation, `ans` becomes 'AAABBCC'.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an odd integer that is at least 7; `s` is "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"; `i` is 2; `x` is 2; `j` is 3; `ans` is 'AAABBCC'**.
