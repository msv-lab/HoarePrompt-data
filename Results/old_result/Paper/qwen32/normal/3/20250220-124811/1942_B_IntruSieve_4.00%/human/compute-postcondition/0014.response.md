Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is a list containing the value `-arr[i]`; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0; `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0; the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`.**
