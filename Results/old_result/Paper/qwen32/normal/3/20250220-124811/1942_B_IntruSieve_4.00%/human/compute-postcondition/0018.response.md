The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is a constant input integer.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` and `arr` do not need to be modified since they are not part of the loop head. The same applies to `a`, `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` as they are not directly controlled by the loop head.

At the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next element in the range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index + 1**
