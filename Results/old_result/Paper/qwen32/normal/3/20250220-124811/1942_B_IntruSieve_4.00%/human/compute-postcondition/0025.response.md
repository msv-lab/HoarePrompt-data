Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index + 1; `mex` now includes an additional element `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.**
