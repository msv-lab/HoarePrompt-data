The given code snippet appends the value of `minn` to the list `mex`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the state of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `i` remains unchanged. The only change is that `mex` now includes the value of `minn` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index + 1; `mex` includes `minn` as its new last element.**
