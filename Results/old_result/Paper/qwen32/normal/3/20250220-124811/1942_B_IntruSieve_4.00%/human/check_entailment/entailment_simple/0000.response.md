To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and the given example test cases.

### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is calculated as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The task is to reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.
   - The `MEX` of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

2. **Approach of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes `minn` to 0, which represents the smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex` (the constructed permutation `p`).
   - It initializes `maxx` to 0, which keeps track of the maximum value in `mex`.
   - For each element `a_i` in `a`:
     - If `a_i` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, it increments `minn` again to ensure `minn` is the smallest unused non-negative integer.
     - If `a_i` is non-positive, it calculates `abs(a_i - minn)` and appends it to `mex`. If this value exceeds `maxx`, it updates `maxx`.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `mex`.

3. **Verification with Example Test Cases:**
   - **First Test Case:**
     - `n = 5`
     - `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
     - Expected `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
     - The program constructs `mex` as `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` which matches the expected `p`.
   - **Second Test Case:**
     - `n = 5`
     - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - Expected `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
     - The program constructs `mex` as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` which matches the expected `p`.
   - **Third Test Case:**
     - `n = 3`
     - `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
     - Expected `p = [2, 0, 1]`
     - The program constructs `mex` as `[2, 0, 1]` which matches the expected `p`.

4. **Analysis:**
   - The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` in all provided test cases.
   - The logic for handling both positive and non-positive values in `a` appears to be correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implemented based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
