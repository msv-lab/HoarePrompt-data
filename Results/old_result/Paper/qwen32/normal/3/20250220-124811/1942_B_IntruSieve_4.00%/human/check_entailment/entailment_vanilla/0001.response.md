Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
Given an array `a` of length `n`, where each element `a_i` is defined by `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, the task is to reconstruct the permutation `p` of length `n` using the array `a`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over the array `a` and constructing the permutation `p` based on the value of `a_i`. The key steps are:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the permutation `p`.
   - `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` is used to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation, while `maxx` is used to track the largest value in the constructed permutation.

2. **Iteration over `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in `a`:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` (the current smallest non-negative integer not yet used) and increments `minn`. If `minn` becomes equal to `maxx`, it increments `minn` further to ensure it is the smallest unused integer.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, it updates `maxx` to this new value.

3. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the constructed permutation `mex`.

### Correctness Analysis
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

- **Incorrect Handling of `arr[i] <= 0`**: The program uses `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to determine the next element of the permutation when `arr[i] <= 0`. This approach does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not ensure that the permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- **Logic for `minn` and `maxx`**: The logic to increment `minn` and update `maxx` is flawed and does not correctly maintain the MEX property of the permutation.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain a set of unused integers and update it as we construct the permutation. Here is a sketch of the correct approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a set `unused` to keep track of all integers from 0 to `n-1` that are not yet used in the permutation.

2. **Iteration over `a`**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in `a`:
     - Compute `mex_i`, which is the smallest unused integer in the set `unused`.
     - Set `p_i = mex_i - arr[i]`.
     - Remove `p_i` from the set `unused`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the constructed permutation `p`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to incorrect handling of the MEX property and logic for constructing the permutation.

**Correctness: False**
