Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `mex` is an empty list; `minn` is 0; `maxx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        minn += 1
        if minn == maxx:
            minn = maxx + 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
            maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` is a list containing the single element 0, and if `minn` equals `maxx`, then `minn` is set to `maxx` + 1. Otherwise, if `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `mex` is a list containing the value `-arr[i]`, `minn` is set to 0, and `maxx` is set to `-arr[i]` if the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`; otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index + 1. If `arr[i] > 0`, `mex` includes `minn` as its new last element, and if `minn` was equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is incremented by 1 to be `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, `mex` now includes an additional element `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, and if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -`n` <= `a_i` <= `n`; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index. If `arr[i]` > 0, `mex` contains the previous elements of `mex` plus `minn`. If `minn` was equal to `maxx`, then `minn` is now `maxx + 1`. Otherwise, `minn` remains unchanged. If `arr[i]` is not greater than 0, `mex` now includes an additional element equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. If `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
