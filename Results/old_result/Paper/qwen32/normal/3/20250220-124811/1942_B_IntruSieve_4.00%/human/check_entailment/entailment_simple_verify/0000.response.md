Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is correct or not.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it matches the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list to store the elements of the permutation \( p \).
   - `minn` is initialized to 0, representing the smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`.
   - `maxx` is initialized to 0, which seems to be used to track the maximum value in `mex` but is not necessary for the logic.

2. **Loop through each element in \( a \)**:
   - If \( a[i] > 0 \), the program appends `minn` to `mex`, then increments `minn` by 1. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it increments `minn` again. This step is intended to find the MEX of the current prefix of \( p \).
   - If \( a[i] \leq 0 \), the program appends \( \text{abs}(a[i] - \text{minn}) \) to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary. This step is intended to handle the case where \( a[i] \) is negative, which means \( p_i \) is not simply the MEX but is influenced by the value of \( a[i] \).

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Handling of \( a[i] > 0 \)**:
   - The logic to handle positive \( a[i] \) is flawed. It simply appends `minn` and increments `minn`, which does not correctly compute the MEX of the current prefix of \( p \). The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the current prefix of \( p \).

2. **Handling of \( a[i] \leq 0 \)**:
   - The logic to handle non-positive \( a[i] \) is also flawed. It appends \( \text{abs}(a[i] - \text{minn}) \) to `mex`, which is not the correct way to determine \( p_i \). The correct approach should be to determine \( p_i \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) from \( a \):
1. Maintain a set of used numbers to determine the MEX.
2. For each \( a[i] \):
   - Compute the MEX of the current prefix of \( p \).
   - Determine \( p_i \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX} - p_i \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \). The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not properly handle the calculation of the MEX value and the construction of the permutation \( p \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
