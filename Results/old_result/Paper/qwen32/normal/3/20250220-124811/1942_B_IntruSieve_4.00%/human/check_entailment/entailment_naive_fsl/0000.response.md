Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed, and it does not properly handle the calculation of the MEX value and the construction of the permutation `p`.

Here's a specific counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

The program incorrectly constructs the permutation `p` as `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` instead of a valid permutation like `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.

Let's break down why this happens:

1. The program initializes `minn` to 0 and `maxx` to 0.
2. For the first element `a[0] = 1`, it appends `minn` (which is 0) to `mex`, then increments `minn` to 1.
3. For the second element `a[1] = 1`, it again appends `minn` (which is 1) to `mex`, then increments `minn` to 2.
4. For the third element `a[2] = -2`, it appends `abs(-2 - 2) = 4` to `mex` and updates `maxx` to 4.
5. For the fourth element `a[3] = 1`, it appends `minn` (which is 2) to `mex`, then increments `minn` to 3.
6. For the fifth element `a[4] = 2`, it appends `minn` (which is 3) to `mex`, then increments `minn` to 4.

This results in `mex` being `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is not the correct permutation `p`. The program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the construction of `p` based on the given `a`.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
