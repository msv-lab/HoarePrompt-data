The provided code snippet includes a `print` statement that outputs the value of `itm`, followed by a space, without a newline at the end (`end=' '`). However, the initial state does not provide any information about a variable named `itm`. It only describes the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx`. 

Since `itm` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise description of what will be printed.

However, if we assume that `itm` is a variable that should be defined based on the context of the problem (which is not provided here), we can only describe the output in terms of `itm`.

Output: **itm (where itm is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state)**
