The code snippet sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`. This means that the value of `minn` is now one more than the value of `maxx`.

Given the initial state, all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `i` stay the same. The variable `mex` also remains unchanged as the code does not modify it directly. The only change is in the value of `minn`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is the current index; `mex` contains the previous elements of `mex` plus `minn`; `minn` is `maxx + 1`.**
