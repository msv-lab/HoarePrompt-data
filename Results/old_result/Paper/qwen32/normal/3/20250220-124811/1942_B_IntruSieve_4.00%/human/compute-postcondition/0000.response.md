Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.**

In this output state, `n` has been assigned the value of the integer input. The other variables, `t` and `a`, remain unchanged.
