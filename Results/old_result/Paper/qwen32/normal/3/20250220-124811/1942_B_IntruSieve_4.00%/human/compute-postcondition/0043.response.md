To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it affects the variables `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx`.

The provided loop iterates over each element in the list `mex` and prints it. The loop does not modify `mex`, `minn`, or `maxx` in any way. Therefore, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of `mex`, `minn`, and `maxx` will remain the same as they were initially.

Given:
- `mex` is a list of `n` integers.
- `minn` is the next smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`.
- `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.

Since the loop simply prints each element of `mex` and does not alter `mex`, `minn`, or `maxx`, the final state will be identical to the initial state.

Output State: **`mex` is a list of `n` integers, `minn` is the next smallest non-negative integer not used in `mex`, and `maxx` is the maximum value in `mex`.**

In simple terms, the output state after the loop finishes executing is that the list `mex` remains unchanged, along with the values of `minn` and `maxx`.
