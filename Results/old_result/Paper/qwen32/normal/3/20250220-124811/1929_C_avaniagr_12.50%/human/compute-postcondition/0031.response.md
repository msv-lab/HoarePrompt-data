Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then no specific change is described for `x` or `a` unless `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 3` or less than or equal to `x + 2`. Otherwise, `z` is `x + 1` if `k - 1` is 1, otherwise `z` is a value determined by the loop's iterative process, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`.**
