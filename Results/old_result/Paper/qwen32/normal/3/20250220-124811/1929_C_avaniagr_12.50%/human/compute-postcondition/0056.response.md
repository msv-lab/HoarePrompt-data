The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of `t`, `k`, `x`, or `a`. The loop simply runs `t` times, and the state of `t` determines whether the loop can execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer input such that `0 <= t < 1000`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, meaning `t` should be `t - 1`.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided in the input.**
