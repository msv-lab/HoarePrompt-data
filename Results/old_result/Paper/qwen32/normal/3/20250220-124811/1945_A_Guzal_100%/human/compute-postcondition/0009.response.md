Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. The current value of `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0.**

In natural language: The value of `k` has been incremented by 1, so `k` is now equal to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
