Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Introverts (a):** Each introvert wants to live alone, meaning each introvert will need one tent.
2. **Extroverts (b):** Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with exactly two others. Thus, each tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people.
3. **Universals (c):** These participants are flexible and can be accommodated in any tent configuration.

The goal is to find the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or determine if it's impossible.

### Key Observations:

- **Introverts:** Each introvert requires one tent.
- **Extroverts:** Extroverts must be in groups of three. If `b` is not divisible by 3, we need to see if we can use universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
- **Universals:** They can fill in any gaps created by introverts or extroverts.

### Conditions for Impossibility:

- If the number of extroverts `b` is not divisible by 3 and the remaining spots after forming as many groups of three as possible cannot be filled by universals, it is impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Solution Analysis:

Let's break down the provided solution:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)
```

1. **Impossibility Check:**
   - `if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:` This checks if the number of extroverts that cannot form a complete group of three (`b % 3`) plus the number of universals (`c`) is less than 3. If true, it's impossible to accommodate the remaining extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

2. **Calculating Tents:**
   - `k += a`: Each introvert needs one tent.
   - `k += (b + c) // 3`: This accounts for the number of complete groups of three people (extroverts and universals combined) that can be formed.
   - `if (b + c) % 3 != 0:` If there are leftover people after forming complete groups, an additional tent is needed to accommodate them.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution correctly handles the conditions for impossibility and calculates the minimum number of tents needed based on the given constraints. It checks if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with universals and correctly adds tents for introverts and groups of three.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
