The value of `k` is incremented by `a + (b + c) // 3`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, `b`, `c` <= 10^9; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `k` is `k + a + (b + c) // 3`.
