Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, then `k` remains 0. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k + a + (b + c) // 3`. If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, then `k` is further incremented by 1.**
