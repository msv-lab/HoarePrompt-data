The code snippet only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions `t` and the subsequent lines containing `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these are not affected by the given code snippet. The variable `n` is introduced and assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the next t lines contains three integers a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` is an input integer.**
