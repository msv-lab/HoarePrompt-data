The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Given that `d.get(i)` is not `None`, it means that the key `i` already exists in the dictionary `d` with some integer value. Therefore, after executing the code, the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` will be increased by 1. The other variables (`t`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary, and `d[i]` is the previous value of `d[i]` plus 1.**
