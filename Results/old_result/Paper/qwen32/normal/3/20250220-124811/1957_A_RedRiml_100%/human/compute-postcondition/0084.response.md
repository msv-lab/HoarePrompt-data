The code snippet provided is `pl = []`, which initializes the list `pl` as an empty list. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, or `palka`. Therefore, the only change is that `pl` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3; `w` is `w - 1`; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `pl` is an empty list.**
