Postcondition: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w - 1`, where `w` is greater than 1; `ln` is the new input integer; `palka` is a new list of integers from the input and must have at least 1 element; `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the value `i` (if `i` was not in `pl` before, it is now added); `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j] >= 3`. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d` is updated to contain the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, if `d.get(i)` is not `None`, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by `1`.**
