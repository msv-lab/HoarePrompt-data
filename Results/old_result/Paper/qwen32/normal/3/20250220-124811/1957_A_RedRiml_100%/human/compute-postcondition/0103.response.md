Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `d` is unchanged except `d[i]` is now `d[i] + 1`, `i` is the next element in `palka`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains unchanged, `shapes` is still the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is at least 3, `w` is decremented by 1, `ln` is still the input integer, `palka` remains a list of integers with at least one element, `d` is unchanged except that the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and `i` is still the next element in `palka`.
