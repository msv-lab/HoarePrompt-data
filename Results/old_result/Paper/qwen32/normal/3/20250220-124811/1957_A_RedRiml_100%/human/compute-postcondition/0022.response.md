The code snippet `d[i] = 1` modifies the dictionary `d` by setting the value of the key `i` to 1. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is overwritten to 1. If `i` was not a key in `d`, it is added with the value 1. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, or `w`. The value of `i` remains the same as it is used to index into the dictionary `d`.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is 1 (if `i` was not previously a key in `d` or was already a key and its value is now set to 1); `pl` includes the integer `i` if it was not already in `pl`; `i` is the next element in `palka` after the current `i`.**
