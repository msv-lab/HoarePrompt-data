Postcondition: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `pl` is an empty list; `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now has the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is the previous value of `d[i]` plus 1. Additionally, `i` is not in `pl`.**
