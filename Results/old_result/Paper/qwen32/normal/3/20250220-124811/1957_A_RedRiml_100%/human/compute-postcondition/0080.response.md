To determine the output of the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the calculation involved.

### Initial State:
1. **Variable `t`**: It is mentioned that `t` is unchanged, but it is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. **Variable `shapes`**: It is defined as the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

### Calculation Breakdown:
- `pl`: This is a list of indices.
- `d`: This is a list of integers.
- For each index `j` in `pl`, we check if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
- If the condition is met, we perform integer division of `d[j]` by 3 (`d[j] // 3`) and add the result to the sum.
- The final result of this sum is stored in the variable `shapes`.

### Example Calculation (Hypothetical):
Let's assume some hypothetical values to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `pl = [0, 2, 4]`
- Suppose `d = [5, 2, 9, 1, 12]`

For each index in `pl`:
- `j = 0`: `d[0] = 5`, which is greater than or equal to 3. So, `5 // 3 = 1`.
- `j = 2`: `d[2] = 9`, which is greater than or equal to 3. So, `9 // 3 = 3`.
- `j = 4`: `d[4] = 12`, which is greater than or equal to 3. So, `12 // 3 = 4`.

Summing these results: `1 + 3 + 4 = 8`.

Thus, `shapes` would be `8` in this hypothetical case.

### General Description:
Since the exact values of `pl` and `d` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, we can describe the calculation precisely.

### Output:
The `print(shapes)` statement will print the calculated sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of d[j] // 3 for all j in pl where d[j] is greater than or equal to 3)**
