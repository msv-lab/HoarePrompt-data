The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `pl` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `pl` will contain the value `i` as its first and only element.

The other variables (`t`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input that has at least 1 integer; `pl` is a list containing the integer `i`; `d` is a dictionary where if `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now has the key `i` with the value `1`. Otherwise, `d[i]` is the previous value of `d[i]` plus 1. Additionally, `i` is not in `pl` (this part is no longer valid as `i` is now in `pl`).**
