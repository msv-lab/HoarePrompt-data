The code snippet `shapes += d[j] // 3` adds the integer division of `d[j]` by 3 to the variable `shapes`. Given that `j` is the third element of the list `pl` and `pl` contains unique elements from `palka`, the value of `d[j]` can be determined based on the dictionary `d`.

Output State: **`pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` and must have at least three elements, `j` is the third element of `pl`, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`.**

In natural language: The list `pl` remains a list of unique elements from `palka` with at least three elements, and `j` remains the third element of `pl`. The variable `shapes` is updated to its previous value plus the integer division of `d[j]` by 3.
