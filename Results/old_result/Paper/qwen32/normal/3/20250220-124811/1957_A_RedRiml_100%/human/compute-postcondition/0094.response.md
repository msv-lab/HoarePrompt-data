Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `d` is a dictionary. If `i` was not in `pl` initially, `pl` now contains the element `i`, and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1 (or set to 1 if it was initially `None`). If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1 (or set to 1 if it was initially `None`).**
