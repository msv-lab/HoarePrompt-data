The code provided only initializes an empty dictionary `d`. None of the other variables (`t`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers from the input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.**
