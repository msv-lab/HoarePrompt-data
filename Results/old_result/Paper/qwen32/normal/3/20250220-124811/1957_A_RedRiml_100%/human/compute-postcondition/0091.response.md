Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
