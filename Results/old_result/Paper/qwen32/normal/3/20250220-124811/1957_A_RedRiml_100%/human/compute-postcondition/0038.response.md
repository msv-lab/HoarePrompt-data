Postcondition: **`t` is assigned the value of the input integer `w`, where `w` is greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers from the input; `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `palka`; `pl` is a list that contains each unique integer from `palka` in the order they first appear and must have at least two elements; `j` is the second element in `pl`. If `d[j] >= 3`, then `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`.**
