Output State: **`S` is `[[0, 0], ..., [count_0, count_not_0]]`; `ans` is 0; `satisfy` is 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `left` is `S[1][0]`; `lsum` is `left + S[1][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[1][1]`; `rsum` is `n - lsum`. If either `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` holds true, the condition remains as is. Otherwise, `ans` satisfies the condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values and conditions.
