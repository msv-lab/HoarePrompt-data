### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function is designed to determine the optimal position `i` to place the road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side of the village.
   - **Process**:
     - It reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1'.
     - It constructs a list `S` where `S[i]` keeps a running count of the number of '0's and '1's up to the `i-th` position.
     - It then iterates through each possible position `i` to check if the conditions are met:
       - `left * 2 < lsum` checks if the number of '0's to the left of `i` is at least half of the total elements to the left.
       - `right * 2 < rsum` checks if the number of '1's to the right of `i` is at least half of the total elements to the right.
     - It keeps track of the position `i` that satisfies these conditions and is closest to `n / 2`.
     - Finally, it prints the optimal position `i`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: This function handles multiple test cases.
   - **Process**:
     - It reads the number of test cases.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to determine the optimal position `i` and prints the result.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly constructs the running counts of '0's and '1's.
  - It correctly checks the conditions for each possible position `i` to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
  - It correctly finds the position `i` that is closest to `n / 2` among those that satisfy the conditions.
  - The output hints for `func_1` indicate that it behaves as expected.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
  - There are no issues indicated in the output hints for `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together meet the problem description and handle the input as required. Each test case is processed correctly, and the optimal position `i` is determined accurately.

**Correctness: True**
