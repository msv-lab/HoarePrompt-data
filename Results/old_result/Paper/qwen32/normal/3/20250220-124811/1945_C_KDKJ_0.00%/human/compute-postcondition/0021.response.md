Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of houses, `a` is a non-empty string input by the user with at least 3 characters, `s` is the third character of the string `a`. If `s` is '0', then `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x + 1, y]]`. Otherwise, `S` is `[[0, 0], [x, y], [x, y + 1]]`, where `x` and `y` are the values from the last sublist of `S` before the modification.**
