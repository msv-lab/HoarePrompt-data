Postcondition: **`S` is `[[0, 0], ..., [count_0, count_not_0]]`; `ans` is 0; `satisfy` is 0; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `left` is 0; `lsum` is 0; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`; `rsum` is `n`. If either `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` holds true, the condition remains as is. Otherwise, `ans` satisfies the condition `abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans)`.**
