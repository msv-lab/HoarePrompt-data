The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range function's arguments. The range function here is `range(1, int(w // 1))`. Since `w` is an integer greater than 1, `int(w // 1)` is simply `w`.

The loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `w - 1` (since the upper limit in the `range` function is exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, `i` should be adjusted to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1) and the last element is `q`. `i` is 2. If `q` modulo `i` is 0, and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` includes `i` as the second-to-last element if `q // i` is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
