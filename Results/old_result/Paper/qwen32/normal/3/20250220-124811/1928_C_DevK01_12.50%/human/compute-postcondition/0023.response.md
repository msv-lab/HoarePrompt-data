Let's analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

Initial State: 
- `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples.
- `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1). If `i >= x - 1`, then the second element of `M` is set to 3.
- `i` is 3.

Code Snippet:
```python
M += [q // i]
```

The code attempts to perform an operation `q // i`, but `q` is a list of tuples, and the `//` operator is not applicable to a list. This will raise a `TypeError`.

However, given the task's instructions to strictly follow the format and assume the code executes without error, we need to interpret the operation as if it were valid. The operation `q // i` would imply some form of integer division of `q` by `i`, but since `q` is a list, this operation is not valid in Python. 

For the sake of this task, let's assume the intention was to perform some operation on each tuple in `q` and then append the result to `M`. However, since the operation is not valid, we will consider the state as it would be if the operation were valid and resulted in an error or an undefined behavior. In this context, we will assume the operation does not change the state of `q` and only appends an undefined value (which we will denote as `undefined`) to `M`.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1), and the second element is 3 if `i >= x - 1`, and `M` now contains an additional element `undefined`; `i` is 3.**

In simpler terms, `q` remains unchanged, `M` has an additional element `undefined` appended to it, and `i` remains 3.
