You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and q contains between 1 and 100 tuples.
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list; a `TypeError` occurs because `math.sqrt` is called on a list.
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:

    #State: - `M` will start with `w` and will contain all divisors `i` of `q` such that `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `q // i` values.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:
    #
    #Output State:
    return M
    #The program returns a list `M` that starts with `w` and contains all divisors `i` of `q` such that `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `q // i` values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` for each tuple in `q` that contains all divisors `i` of `n` such that `i >= x - 1` and `n // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `n // i` values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not properly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case. The function `func_1` is intended to find divisors of a given number, but it does not correctly handle the logic for determining the valid `k` values based on Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x`.

Here are a few issues and test cases that demonstrate the incorrectness of the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but this does not align with the problem's logic for determining valid `k` values. The correct approach involves checking the periodicity of the sequence and the position within that sequence.

2. **Logic for Determining Valid `k` Values**: The program uses a function `func_1` to find divisors, but it does not correctly apply the conditions specified in the problem description. The conditions for `k` involve checking whether the position `n` falls within a segment of the sequence where the number `x` can appear.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is 1 or when `n` is small relative to `x`.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
For `n = 5` and `x = 3`, the valid `k` values are those where the sequence includes `3` at position `5`. The only valid `k` value is `3`:
- Sequence for `k = 3`: 1, 2, 3, 2, 1

However, the provided program would likely not output `1` for this case because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine valid `k` values.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to these issues.
