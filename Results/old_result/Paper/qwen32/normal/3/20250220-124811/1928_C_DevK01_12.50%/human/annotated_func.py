#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and q contains between 1 and 100 tuples.
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: `q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing the integer `w` if `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list; a `TypeError` occurs because `math.sqrt` is called on a list.
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
    #State: - `M` will start with `w` and will contain all divisors `i` of `q` such that `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `q // i` values.
    #
    #Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is:
    #
    #Output State:
    return M
    #The program returns a list `M` that starts with `w` and contains all divisors `i` of `q` such that `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `q // i` values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` for each tuple in `q` that contains all divisors `i` of `n` such that `i >= x - 1` and `n // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `n // i` values.
