The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is 3, the list `M` will now include 3 as its second element. The other variables, `q` and `i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing integers where the first element is `w` (an integer greater than 1) and the second element is 3; `i` is 3.**
