### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to ensure correctness:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the number of possible values of `k` for which Vasya's position `n` and received number `x` are consistent with the described settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from `1` to `k` and back to `2`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For a given `k`, the sequence of numbers assigned to positions will be:
     - `1, 2, 3, ..., k, k-1, k-2, ..., 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., k, ...` and so on.
   - The position `n` modulo `2k - 2` will determine which part of the sequence `n` falls into.
   - If `n % (2k - 2) <= k`, the number at position `n` is `n % (2k - 2)`.
   - If `n % (2k - 2) > k`, the number at position `n` is `2k - 2 - n % (2k - 2) + 1`.

3. **Approach in the Code**:
   - The code calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If not, it prints `0` because the pattern does not fit.
   - If `y` is even, it calculates `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` and calls `func_1` to find divisors that fit the criteria.
   - `func_1` is supposed to find divisors `i` of `q` such that `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1`.

4. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined to take a list of tuples `q` instead of an integer `q`.
   - The loop in `func_1` runs up to `int(w // 1)`, which is incorrect. It should run up to `int(w) + 1` to include all divisors.
   - The function `func_1` should be called with an integer, not a list of tuples.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the code, particularly with the incorrect parameter type and loop range in `func_1`, the program is not correctly implemented according to the problem description and the logic required to solve it.

**Correctness: False**
