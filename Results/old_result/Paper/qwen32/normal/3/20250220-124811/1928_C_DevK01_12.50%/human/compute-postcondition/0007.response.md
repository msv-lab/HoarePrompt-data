Postcondition: **`q` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, and `q` contains between 1 and 100 tuples; `M` is a list containing the integer `w` where `w` is an integer and `w > 1`; `i` is 1, and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. The current value of `q` modulo `i` is 0.**
