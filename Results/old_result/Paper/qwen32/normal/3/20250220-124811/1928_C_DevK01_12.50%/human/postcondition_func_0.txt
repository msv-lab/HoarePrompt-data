The function accepts a list `q` of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `x` such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and an integer `x`. It returns a list `M` for each tuple in `q` that contains all divisors `i` of `n` such that `i >= x - 1` and `n // i >= x - 1`, along with their corresponding `n // i` values.
