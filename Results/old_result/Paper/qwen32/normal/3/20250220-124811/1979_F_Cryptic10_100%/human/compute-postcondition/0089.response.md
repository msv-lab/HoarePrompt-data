Postcondition: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1` or `v3`), `ops` is a list that contains one tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the result of `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.**
