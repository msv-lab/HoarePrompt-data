Postcondition: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) removed, and `len(vx)` is greater than 2. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` contains the original elements plus the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `ops` contains the original elements plus the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, and `v3` is removed from `vx`. `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` and `v3` removed if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`. `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`. `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, and `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.**
