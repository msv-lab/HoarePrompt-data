The given code snippet involves a conditional operation that appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. Here's the breakdown of the operation and the resulting output state.

- If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, then `v1` is appended to `p2`.
- Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` are not provided, we will describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are the next pair in the reversed list `ops[::-1]`; if `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` is updated to `p2 + [v1]`, else `p1` is updated to `p1 + [v1]`.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `v1` is appended to `p2` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. Otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
