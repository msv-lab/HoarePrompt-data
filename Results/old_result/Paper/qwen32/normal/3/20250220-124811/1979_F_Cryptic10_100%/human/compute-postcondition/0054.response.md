The code snippet `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are not altered by this operation, but the list `ops` is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to an integer value greater than 2 with `v1` and `v3` (if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) removed and `v1` further removed, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, plus the newly added tuple `(v1, v2)`, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` (with `v1` and `v3` removed if `v2` is less than or equal to 0) and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0.**
