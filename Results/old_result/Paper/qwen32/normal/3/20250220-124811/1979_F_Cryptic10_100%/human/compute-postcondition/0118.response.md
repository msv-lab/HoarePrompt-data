Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph. For each test case, it interacts with an external system by sending queries and receiving responses to determine a Hamiltonian path in the graph. After processing all test cases, it outputs the Hamiltonian path for each graph.**
