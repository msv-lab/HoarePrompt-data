The code snippet provided appends two tuples to the `ops` list. The first tuple is `(v3, 0)` and the second is `(v1, 0)`. Here's the updated state of the variables after the code execution:

- `t` remains an integer from 1 to 1000.
- `vx` is a set of integers with at least 1 element after removing `v3` and `v1`.
- `ops` is no longer empty; it now contains the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.
- `v1` is the value that was removed from `vx`.
- `v2` remains a value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` and is less than or equal to 0.
- `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 1 element, `ops` is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `v1` is the value removed from `vx`, `v2` is a value returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)` and is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.**
