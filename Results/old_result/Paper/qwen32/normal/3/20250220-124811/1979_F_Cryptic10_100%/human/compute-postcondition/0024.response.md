The code snippet appends a tuple containing `v1` and `v2` to the list `ops`. The values of `t`, `vx`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1`), `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`, `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`**.
