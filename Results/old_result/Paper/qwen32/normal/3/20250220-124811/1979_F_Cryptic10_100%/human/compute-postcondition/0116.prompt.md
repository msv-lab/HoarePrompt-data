Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func()` does not take any input parameters. The input is handled through standard input as described in the problem statement: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines each containing a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of vertices in the graph for each test case. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function must interact with the system by outputting queries and reading responses as specified in the problem statement to determine a Hamiltonian path for each test case. The lambda function `q` is defined to print a query and read a response.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` and additional elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` is a list containing elements from `ops` where `p1[-1] == v2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set containing 2 or fewer integers, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: 




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
