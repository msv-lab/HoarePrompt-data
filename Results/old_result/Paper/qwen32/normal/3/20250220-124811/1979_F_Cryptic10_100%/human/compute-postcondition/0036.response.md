The given code snippet operates on the variables `t`, `vx`, and `ops`, with `(v1, v2)` being the next tuple in reverse order from `ops`. The code appends `v1` to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`.

Let's break down the impact of the code on the variables:

- `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000 and is not affected by the code snippet.
- `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements and is not affected by the code snippet.
- `ops` is a list of tuples, and `(v1, v2)` is the next tuple in reverse order from `ops`. This tuple is used in the condition and the append operation.
- `p1` and `p2` are lists that are part of the tuples in `ops`. Depending on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`, either `p1` or `p2` will have `v1` appended to it.

The condition `p1[-1] == v2` checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If true, `v1` is appended to `p2`; otherwise, `v1` is appended to `p1`.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` are not provided, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with 1 or 2 elements, `ops` is a list of tuples containing at least two more tuples before the one that was just processed, and `v1` is appended to `p2` if `p1[-1] == v2`, otherwise `v1` is appended to `p1`.**
