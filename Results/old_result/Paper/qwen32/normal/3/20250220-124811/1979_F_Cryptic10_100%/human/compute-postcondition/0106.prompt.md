Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers from 1 to the input value, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`.
Code of the loop:
while len(vx) > 2:
    v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
    vx.remove(v1)
    if v2 > 0:
        ops += [(v1, v2)]
    else:
        v3, _ = q(0)
        vx.remove(v3)
        ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1` or `v3`), `ops` is a list that contains one tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2` is greater than 0, or `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` if `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `p1` is a list containing the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` is a list containing any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the result of `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000. If `v2` is greater than 0, `vx` is a set of integers with exactly 2 elements after removing `v1`, `ops` contains an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`, `p1` includes the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` includes any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` is a set of integers with exactly 1 element after removing `v3`, `ops` contains `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `p1` includes the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`, `p2` includes any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`, and `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000; `v1` and `v2` are the values returned by `q(len(vx) - 2)`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `vx` is a set of integers with more than 2 elements after removing `v1`, `ops` contains an additional tuple `(v1, v2)`, and `p1` includes the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`; `p2` includes any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `vx` is a set of integers with more than 2 elements after removing both `v1` and `v3` (where `v3` is the value returned by `q(0)`), `ops` contains `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, and `p1` includes the initial elements of `vx` plus any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] != v2`; `p2` includes any `v1` values appended when `p1[-1] == v2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
