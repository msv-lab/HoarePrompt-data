Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set containing 2 or fewer integers, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`, and `p2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set containing 2 or fewer integers, `ops` is a list of tuples representing the operations performed and must contain at least one tuple, `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx` with `v1` appended if `p1[-1] != v2`, and `p2` is a list containing `v1` if `p1[-1] == v2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If `p1[-1] != v2`, then `p1` is updated to include `v1` at the end, and `p2` remains unchanged.
If `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` is updated to include `v1` at the end, and `p1` remains unchanged.

Given the conditions, the output state can be described as follows:
- If the last element of `p1` is not equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p1`.
- If the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, `v1` is appended to `p2`.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v1` and `v2` are the next pair in the reversed list `ops[::-1]`; if `p1[-1] == v2`, then `p2` is updated to `p2 + [v1]`, else `p1` is updated to `p1 + [v1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
