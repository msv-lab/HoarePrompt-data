Postcondition: **`t` is an integer from 1 to 1000, `vx` is a set of integers with at least 2 elements (after removing `v1`), `ops` is a list. If `v2` > 0, then `ops` includes the tuple `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is not greater than 0, then `vx` has an additional element `v3` removed, and `ops` includes two additional elements `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`. `v1` is `q(len(vx) - 2)[0]`, and `v2` is `q(len(vx) - 2)[1]`. If `v2` is not greater than 0, `v3` is the first element of the tuple returned by `q(0)`.**
