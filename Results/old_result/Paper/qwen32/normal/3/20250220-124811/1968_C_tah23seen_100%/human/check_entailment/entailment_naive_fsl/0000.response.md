Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to generate an array `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The function `func_1` attempts to construct the array `ans` but does not follow the correct method to ensure the modulo condition is met.

Here's a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
An array `a_1, a_2, a_3` such that:
- `a_2 % a_1 = 1`
- `a_3 % a_2 = 1`

Possible correct output:
```
2 3 4
```
Here, `3 % 2 = 1` and `4 % 3 = 1`.

**Actual Output from the Program:**
The program will output `1000000000 999999999` or similar, which does not satisfy the conditions:
- `999999999 % 1000000000 = 999999999` (not 1)
- The second condition is not checked because the first condition fails.

The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it subtracts `arr[i]` from `ans[i + 1]` to determine `ans[i]`, which does not guarantee that `ans[i] % ans[i + 1] = arr[i]`. Instead, a correct approach would involve setting `a_1` to a sufficiently large number and then setting `a_i` to `a_{i-1} + x_i` for all `i >= 2`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n  # Start with a large number for a_1
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]  # Ensure a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i
    return ans
```

This corrected function ensures that the modulo condition is met for all test cases.
