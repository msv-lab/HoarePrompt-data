Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We need to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
- \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).
- \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, we are given:
- An integer \( n \) (length of the array \( a \)).
- An array \( x \) of \( n-1 \) integers, where \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \).

The task is to construct an array \( a \) that satisfies the above conditions.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans
```

#### Key Points:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The array `ans` is initialized with \( 10^9 \) for all elements. This is a valid initial choice since \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).

2. **Backward Calculation**:
   - The program starts filling the array `ans` from the end (index \( n-2 \)) to the beginning (index 0).
   - For each index \( i \), it calculates `ans[i]` as `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.

#### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Modulo Calculation**:
  - The program uses subtraction (`ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`) instead of ensuring that `ans[i] % ans[i + 1] == arr[i]`.
  - This does not guarantee that the constructed array `ans` will satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \).

- **Initialization of \( a_1 \)**:
  - The value of \( a_1 \) is never set explicitly. It remains \( 10^9 \) by default.
  - This might not be a problem if the calculations for subsequent elements ensure the condition is met, but the current logic does not guarantee this.

### Correctness

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly ensure that the constructed array `ans` satisfies the required modulo conditions.

**Correctness: False**

To correct the program, one needs to ensure that for each \( i \), \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \). A possible approach is to start with a large value for \( a_1 \) and then calculate subsequent values such that the modulo condition holds. However, the current program does not implement this correctly.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
