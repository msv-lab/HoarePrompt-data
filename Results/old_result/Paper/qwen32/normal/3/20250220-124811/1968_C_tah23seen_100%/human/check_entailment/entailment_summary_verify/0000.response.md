### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **correct**. Let's break down the issues in the provided program and function `func_1`:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an array \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).
   - The values \( a_i \) must be within the range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `ans` with \( 10^9 \) for all elements.
   - It then iterates backward from \( n-2 \) to 0, setting `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.

3. **Issues in `func_1`**:
   - The logic used in `func_1` does not ensure that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \).
   - Subtracting `arr[i]` from `ans[i+1]` does not guarantee the modulo condition is met.
   - The function also fails to handle the initial value \( a_1 \) correctly.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach involves setting \( a_1 \) to a sufficiently large number (e.g., \( 10^9 \)).
   - For \( i \ge 2 \), set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \). This ensures \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \) because \( a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i \) for some integer \( k \).

5. **Example**:
   - For the input `[1, 1]`:
     - Correct output: `[2, 3]` (since \( 3 \mod 2 = 1 \) and \( 3 \mod 3 = 0 \), but we need \( 3 \mod 2 = 1 \)).
     - The provided function would output something like `[10^9, 10^9 - 1]`, which does not satisfy the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate as the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to generate the array \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) that satisfies the modulo conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
