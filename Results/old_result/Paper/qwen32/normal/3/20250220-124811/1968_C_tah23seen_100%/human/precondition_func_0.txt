arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 representing the number of elements in the array a (including the first element a_1 which is not provided in arr). The function is called for each test case, where the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
