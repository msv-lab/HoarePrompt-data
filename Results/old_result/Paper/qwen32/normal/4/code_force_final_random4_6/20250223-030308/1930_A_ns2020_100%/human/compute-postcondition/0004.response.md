The code sorts the list `A`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `A` is now in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `A` is a sorted list of integers.**
