The value of `bx` is set to `-1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `r`, `cx`, `ax`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` is -1.
