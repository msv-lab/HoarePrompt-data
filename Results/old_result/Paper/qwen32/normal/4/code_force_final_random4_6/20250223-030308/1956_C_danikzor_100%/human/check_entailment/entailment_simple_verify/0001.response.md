### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program to ensure it correctly maximizes the sum of the \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.

**Problem Analysis:**
- We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix.
- We can perform up to \( 2n \) operations, where each operation fills either a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

**Key Observations:**
- To maximize the sum, we want to place the highest numbers in as many positions as possible.
- The permutation \([n, n-1, ..., 1]\) ensures that the highest possible numbers are used.

**Program Analysis:**
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible sum using the formula:
     \[
     \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}
     \]
   - This formula correctly calculates the sum of the squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is the maximum sum achievable by filling each row and column with the permutation \([n, n-1, ..., 1]\).

3. **Operations:**
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations:
     - The first \( n \) operations fill each row \( i \) with the permutation \([n, n-1, ..., 1]\).
     - The next \( n \) operations fill each column \( i \) with the same permutation.
   - This ensures that each row and each column is filled with the highest possible permutation, thus achieving the maximum sum.

**Verification:**
- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The formula \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\) is correct for the maximum sum achievable.
- **Operations:**
  - The operations specified are valid and ensure that each row and column is filled with the permutation \([n, n-1, ..., 1]\).
  - This strategy ensures that the matrix is filled optimally to achieve the maximum sum.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The original assessment is accurate.
