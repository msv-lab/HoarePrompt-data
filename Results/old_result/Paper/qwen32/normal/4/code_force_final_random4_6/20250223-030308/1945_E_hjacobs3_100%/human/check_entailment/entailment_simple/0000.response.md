Reasoning: 

The provided program is intended to solve the problem by performing up to two swaps in the permutation array to allow a binary search to correctly identify the position of the target number `x`. However, the implementation in `func_1` does not guarantee that the binary search will correctly find the number `x` after at most two swaps. 

Here are the issues with the provided implementation:

1. **Binary Search Misuse**: The binary search is applied to the original array without ensuring that the array is sorted or that the swaps will result in a sorted array that allows the binary search to correctly identify the position of `x`.

2. **Incorrect Swap Logic**: The logic for determining the swaps is flawed. The current implementation checks if `l` (the index found by binary search) is equal to the index of `x` in the array. If not, it performs a single swap to bring `x` to the position `l`. However, this does not ensure that the array is in a state where binary search will correctly identify `x` in subsequent runs. It also does not consider the possibility of performing a second swap if needed.

3. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped, but the current implementation prints the number of swaps and the indices directly instead of returning them.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
