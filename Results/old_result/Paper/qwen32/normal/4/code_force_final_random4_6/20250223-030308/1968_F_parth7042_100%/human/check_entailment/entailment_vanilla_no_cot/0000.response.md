To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining whether a subarray can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. 

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the input data in one go and processes it.
   - It initializes the number of test cases, the size of the array, and the number of queries for each test case.
   - It constructs the prefix XOR array (`pf`) where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array.
   - It maintains a dictionary (`mp`) that maps each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where this prefix XOR occurs.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it immediately returns "YES" because a subarray with XOR `0` can be trivially split into parts with XOR `0`.
   - Otherwise, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate positions in the lists of indices in `mp` to determine if there exists a valid split.
   - If it finds a valid split, it returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".

### Correctness Check:
- **Prefix XOR Calculation:** The prefix XOR array is correctly computed, and it is used to efficiently compute the XOR of any subarray.
- **Dictionary of Prefix XORs:** The dictionary `mp` correctly maps each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where this value occurs.
- **Query Handling:** The logic to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR is based on finding appropriate indices in the dictionary. This logic is correct but can be improved for efficiency and clarity.

### Potential Improvements:
- The code uses `bisect_left` twice, which is unnecessary. We can simplify the logic by checking if there exists an index `i` in `mp[x^pf[l-1]]` such that `l <= i < r`.
- The use of `bisect_left` and manual index checks can be simplified by leveraging the properties of prefix XORs directly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is logically correct and should work as intended based on the problem requirements. However, it can be optimized for better readability and performance.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
