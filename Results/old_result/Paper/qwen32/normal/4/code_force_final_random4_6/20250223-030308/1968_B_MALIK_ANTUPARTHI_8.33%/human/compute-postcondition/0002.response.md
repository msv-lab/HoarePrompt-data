The code snippet provided takes input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to `b` and `c`. This means that the original `b` (which was a binary string) is replaced by an integer value, and `c` is assigned a new integer value from the input.

Since `b` was originally a binary string of length `m`, and now it is reassigned to an integer value, the original length `m` of the binary string `b` is no longer relevant to the state of `b`. However, all other initial conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer; `c` is an integer; the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
