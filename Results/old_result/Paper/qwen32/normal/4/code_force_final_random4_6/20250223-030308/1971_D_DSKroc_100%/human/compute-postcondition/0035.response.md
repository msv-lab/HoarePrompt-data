Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `s` is a new input string consisting only of the characters '0' and '1' with a length of at least 2, `flag` is 0, and `q` is incremented by 1. If the character at position `i` in `s` is different from the character at position `i + 1`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
