In this task, we need to ensure that the `while queue:` loop can execute at least once. The loop will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty. 

Given the state right before the loop:
- `start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS.
- `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree.
- The tree is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.
- The `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`.
- `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`.

The loop condition is `while queue:`, which means the loop will execute if the `queue` is not empty. Since the `queue` is already described as containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, it is not empty, and the loop can proceed.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree. The tree is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. The queue is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the single element `start`.**
