The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable that does not affect the loop's continuation. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the loop can still execute one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `n` is `q - 1`. `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `M` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element. `cost` is recalculated based on the new values of `L` and `M`. If `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
