The code snippet `x = b.index(i)` updates the value of `x` to the index of the first occurrence of `i` in the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is the input integer
- `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements
- `r` is the string `2 * a[x]`
- `b` is a list with the value at index `x` incremented by 1 (again)
- `x` is the index of `i` in `b`
- `i` is `s[j+1]` where `j` is the index of `s_next` in `s`

After executing `x = b.index(i)`, the value of `x` will be the index of the first occurrence of `i` in the list `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements; `r` is the string `2 * a[x]`; `b` is a list with the value at index `x` incremented by 1 (again); `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b`; `i` is `s[j+1]` where `j` is the index of `s_next` in `s`.**
