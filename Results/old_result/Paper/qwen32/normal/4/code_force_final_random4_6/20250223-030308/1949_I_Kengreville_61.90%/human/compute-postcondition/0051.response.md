The code snippet increments `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Given that `j` is `2` and `coef1[2]` is `None` (since it's not explicitly stated otherwise and `coef1` is a list of `None` values except for `coef1[1]` which is `1`), the operation `c1 += coef1[j]` will result in `c1` being incremented by `None`. However, since `None` cannot be added to an integer, this would typically raise a `TypeError`. Assuming the precondition that `coef1[j]` should be a valid integer, if we consider `coef1[2]` to be `0` (as a reasonable default or by some other means in the broader context), then `c1` would simply remain `1`.

Given the information and assuming `coef1[2]` is `0`, the updated value of `c1` would be `1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n` and `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[1]` which is `0`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[1]` which is `1`, `nodes` is a list containing the integers `[1, 2]`, `i` is 1, `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `1`, `j` is `2`**.
