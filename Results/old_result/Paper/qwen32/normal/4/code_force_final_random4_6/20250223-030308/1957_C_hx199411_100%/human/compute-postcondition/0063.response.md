Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 3, 4, 5, or 6, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is either 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, `num` is either 4, 5, or 6.**
