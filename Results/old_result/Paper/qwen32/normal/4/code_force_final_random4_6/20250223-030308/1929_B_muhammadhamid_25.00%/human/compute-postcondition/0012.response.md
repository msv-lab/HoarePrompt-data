The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that after the execution of the code, `n` and `k` will hold the integer values provided in the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, and the next input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.**
