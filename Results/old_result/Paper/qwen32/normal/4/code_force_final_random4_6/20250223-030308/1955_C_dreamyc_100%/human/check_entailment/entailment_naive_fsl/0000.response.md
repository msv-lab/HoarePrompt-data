Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly account for the alternating pattern of attacks (first ship, last ship, first ship, etc.) and the reduction in durability until a ship sinks.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Attack Simulation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships by dividing `k` into two parts (`a` and `b`), which is not how the Kraken's attacks work. The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on, until a ship sinks.
   - The function does not simulate the actual sequence of attacks and the sinking of ships correctly.

2. **Incorrect Sinking Logic**:
   - The function does not correctly handle the sinking of ships. It simply adds to `ans` whenever the cumulative durability of the first or last ships is less than or equal to the number of attacks, which does not reflect the actual sinking process.

3. **Cumulative Durability Calculation**:
   - The cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` are calculated, but they are not used correctly to simulate the sinking of ships in the alternating pattern described.

Here's a corrected version of the function that properly simulates the Kraken's attacks:

```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    
    nums = deque(nums)
    attacks = 0
    while k > 0 and nums:
        # Attack the first ship
        if nums[0] > 0:
            nums[0] -= 1
            attacks += 1
            if nums[0] == 0:
                nums.popleft()
        
        if k > attacks:
            # Attack the last ship
            if nums and nums[-1] > 0:
                nums[-1] -= 1
                attacks += 1
                if nums[-1] == 0:
                    nums.pop()
        
        k -= attacks
        attacks = 0
    
    return n - len(nums)

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version properly simulates the alternating attacks and correctly handles the sinking of ships. The original program does not do this and hence is incorrect.
