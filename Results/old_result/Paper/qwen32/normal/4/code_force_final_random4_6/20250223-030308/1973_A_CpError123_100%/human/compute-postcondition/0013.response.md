Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is the next iteration counter; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified, the state remains the same.
