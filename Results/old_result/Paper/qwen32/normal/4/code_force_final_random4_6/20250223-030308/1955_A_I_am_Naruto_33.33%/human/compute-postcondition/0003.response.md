Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 1, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, `ans1` is `a * n`.**

This means that the variable `ans1` has been assigned the value of `a` multiplied by `n`, while the other variables retain their initial states.
