The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the variable `ans` and the integer `1`. This operation will flip the least significant bit of `ans`. If `ans` was `0`, it becomes `1`, and if `ans` was `1`, it becomes `0`. However, since `ans` is not defined in the initial state, we'll assume `ans` starts at `0` for the sake of this example (as it is a common default value for such variables).

Given that `ans` is initially `0`, after the operation `ans ^= 1`, `ans` will be `1`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` which contains unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1**.
