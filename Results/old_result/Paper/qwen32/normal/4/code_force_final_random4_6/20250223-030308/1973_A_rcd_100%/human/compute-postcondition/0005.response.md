The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in the given code snippet, there is no loop, so the `continue` statement does not affect the execution in any meaningful way. Therefore, the values of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
