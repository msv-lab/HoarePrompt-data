To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it affects the `frequency_table` based on the input list `arr` and the integer `k`.

The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `arr`. For each `num`, it updates the `frequency_table` to count the occurrences of `num`. If the count of any `num` exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.

After all iterations, the `frequency_table` will have the frequency of each unique number in `arr`, but no frequency will exceed `k`.

### Output State:
- **`arr`**: Remains unchanged. It is still the list of integers as provided in the input.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged. It is still the integer representing the maximum allowed frequency.
- **`frequency_table`**: A dictionary where each key is a unique number from `arr`, and the value is the count of that number in `arr`, capped at `k`.

### Natural Language Description:
The output state after all iterations of the loop is that the `frequency_table` will have each unique number from the list `arr` as keys, and their corresponding values will be the counts of these numbers in `arr`, but no count will exceed `k`. The list `arr` and the integer `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with each unique number from `arr` as keys and their counts (capped at `k`) as values.**
