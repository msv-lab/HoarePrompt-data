The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings, converts each substring into an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `v`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
