Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers. The function calculates a list `pos` starting with an initial value and then adds `removals` additional values calculated as `s - 2 * s2` in each iteration. The function returns the maximum value in the `pos` list, which contains `removals + 1` elements.**
