The variables in the loop head are `j`, `m`, `b[j]`, and `a[i]`. According to the loop condition `while j < m and b[j] != a[i]`, the loop will execute as long as both conditions are true.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1
- `b[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that both conditions `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]` are satisfied.

1. **Adjust `j` and `m`**: Since `j` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `j < m`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 1.
2. **Adjust `b[j]` and `a[i]`**: Since `b[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`, we need to ensure that `b[j] != a[i]` for the current `j` value. Given that `j` is 1, we need to ensure that `b[1] != a[1]`.

No other states need to be adjusted according to the objects in the loop head.

State: **`t`, `n`, `m` must be greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `b[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`**
