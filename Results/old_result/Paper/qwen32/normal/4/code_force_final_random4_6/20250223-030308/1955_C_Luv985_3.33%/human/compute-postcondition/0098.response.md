Postcondition: **`t` is `k % 2`; `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`; `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. If `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
