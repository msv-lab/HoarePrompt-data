The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Given that `minn` is initially 1 and `same` is either 1 or 3, the minimum value between `minn` and `same` will be 1. Therefore, `minn` remains 1.

The other variables (`t`, `ar`, `n`, `i`, `num`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than or equal to 6; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 4, 5, or 6; `num` is `ar[i]`; `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` initially, otherwise `same` is 1; `minn` is 1.**
