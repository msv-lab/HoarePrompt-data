You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. The next line contains the binary string a of length n, and the following line contains the binary string b of length m. It is guaranteed that the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic step by step:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, the program reads the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b`, followed by the strings themselves.
3. It initializes two pointers: `k` to keep track of the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`, and `j` to traverse the string `b`.
4. It iterates through each character in `a` using a for loop with index `i`.
5. Inside the loop, a while loop is used to move the pointer `j` in `b` until it finds a character that matches `a[i]` or until `j` exceeds the length of `b`.
6. If a match is found (`j < m`), it increments `k` (indicating that the current prefix of `a` is a subsequence of `b` so far) and moves `j` to the next position.
7. If no match is found (`j >= m`), it breaks out of the loop, indicating that the current prefix of `a` cannot be a subsequence of `b`.
8. Finally, it prints the value of `k` for each test case.

This approach correctly identifies the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that can be found as a subsequence in `b` by maintaining the order of characters. The program efficiently handles the constraints given in the problem description, including multiple test cases and large input sizes.
