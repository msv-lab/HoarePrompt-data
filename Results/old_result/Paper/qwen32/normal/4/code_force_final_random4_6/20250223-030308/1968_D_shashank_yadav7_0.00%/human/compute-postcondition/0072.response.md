The code snippet `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Given the initial state, `bp` is initially set to `a[b]`. After the operation, `bp` will be `a[b] + a[b]`, which is `2 * a[b]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `max(0, a[s])`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`**.
