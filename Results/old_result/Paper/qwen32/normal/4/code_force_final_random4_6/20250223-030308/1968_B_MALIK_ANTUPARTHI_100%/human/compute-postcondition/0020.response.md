The values of the variables do not change except for the `break` statement indicating that we exit the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `k` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
