Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; n is an input integer; a is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; b is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; ans is a string starting with the first character of a followed by characters from b starting from the index where work was set to False or the end of a; i is len(a); work is False; j is len(a) - 1; counter is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string starting with the first character of `a` followed by characters from `b` starting from the index where `work` was set to `False` or the end of `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `j` is 0, and `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`. Otherwise, `counter` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string starting with the first character of `a` followed by characters from `b` starting from the index where `work` was set to `False` or the end of `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, `counter` is 3. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`; otherwise, `counter` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string starting with the first character of `a` followed by characters from `b` starting from the index where `work` was set to `False` or the end of `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
