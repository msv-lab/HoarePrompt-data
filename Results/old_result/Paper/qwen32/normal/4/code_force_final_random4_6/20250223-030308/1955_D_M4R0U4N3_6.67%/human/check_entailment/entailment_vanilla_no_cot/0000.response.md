Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in the handling of the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that elements in `a` can be categorized into `todo` and `extra` sets without considering the frequency of elements in `b`. This can lead to incorrect results when there are duplicate elements in `b`.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

- The `todo` set is initialized with the elements of `b`. When an element from `a` matches an element in `todo`, it is moved to the `done` set, and the corresponding element in `todo` is removed. However, this removal only works correctly if there is only one occurrence of each element in `b`.

- If `b` contains duplicate elements, the program should account for the frequency of each element in `b`. The current approach does not handle this, which can lead to incorrect counts of matching elements in subarrays of `a`.

To fix the program, we should use `Counter` from the `collections` module to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b` and `a` within the sliding window. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b_count = Counter(b)
        window_count = Counter(a[:m])
        matches = sum(min(window_count[x], b_count[x]) for x in b_count)
        ans = 1 if matches >= k else 0
        for r in range(m, n):
            old = a[r - m]
            window_count[old] -= 1
            if window_count[old] == 0:
                del window_count[old]
            new = a[r]
            window_count[new] += 1
            if old in b_count:
                matches -= min(window_count[old] + 1, b_count[old]) - min(window_count[old], b_count[old])
            if new in b_count:
                matches += min(window_count[new], b_count[new]) - min(window_count[new] - 1, b_count[new])
            if matches >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version uses `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of elements in `b` and the current window of `a`. It updates the count of matches correctly as the window slides through `a`.
