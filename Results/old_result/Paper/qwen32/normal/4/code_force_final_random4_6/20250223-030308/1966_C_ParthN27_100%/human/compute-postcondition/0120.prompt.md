Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) denoting the number of piles, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    s.sort()
    s = [0] + s
    ans = 1
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans ^= 1
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is either 1 if `n` is 2, or the last index reached before the loop ended, and `ans` is either 0 or 1. If `n` is 2, `i` is 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` indicates whether there are differences between consecutive elements in `s`: `ans` is 1 if there are differences, and `ans` is 0 if there are no differences.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr`, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is 1 if `n` is 2, otherwise `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the value of `i` where the loop breaks, and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2 or if the number of times the difference was `<= 1` is even; otherwise, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` which contains unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended, `i` is the integer input from the user. If `n` is 2, the program remains in the same state as the precondition. If `n` is not 2, `t` remains 1, and `ans` remains 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
