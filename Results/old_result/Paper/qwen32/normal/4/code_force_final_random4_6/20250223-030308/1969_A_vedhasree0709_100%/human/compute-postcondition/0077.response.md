Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 4999\).
2. `n` is at least 1.
3. `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `i` is initialized to 0.
5. `j` is initialized to 0.
6. `p` is the first element of `l`.
7. `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`.
8. It is stated that `q` is equal to `i + 1`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, or `q`. The statement `print(2)` will simply print the integer 2.

### Output:
The print statement will output the integer 2 regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q`.

Output: **2**
