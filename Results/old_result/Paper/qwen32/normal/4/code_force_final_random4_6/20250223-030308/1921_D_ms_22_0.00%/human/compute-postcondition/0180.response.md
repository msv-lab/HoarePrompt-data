The code snippet pushes a tuple into the `max_heap` list using `heapq.heappush`. The tuple consists of `-diff2`, `i`, and `m - 1`. Given that `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, the tuple being pushed is `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`. This operation modifies `max_heap` by adding the new tuple to it.

Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and is now sorted, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**
