Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program attempts to determine the maximum score by distributing the additional cards in a way that maximizes the number of permutations of the sequence [1, 2, ..., n] within the rearranged cards. However, the logic used is flawed and does not accurately account for the best way to distribute the cards to achieve the maximum score.

The main issues with the program include:
1. The program does not correctly handle the distribution of the additional `k` cards to maximize the number of permutations.
2. The calculation of the final score `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` does not correctly reflect the number of permutations that can be formed.
3. The program does not consider the optimal way to distribute the cards to ensure that the maximum number of permutations of [1, 2, ..., n] can be achieved.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed, such as using a greedy algorithm to distribute the additional cards in a way that maximizes the number of permutations within the constraints.
