The value of `old` is updated to `a[r - m]`. Given that `r` is `m + 2`, we can express `r - m` as `2`. Therefore, `old` is now `a[2]`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `k` is the integer provided by the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `j` is `m-1`, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[2]` and is not in `extra`, if the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 3**.
