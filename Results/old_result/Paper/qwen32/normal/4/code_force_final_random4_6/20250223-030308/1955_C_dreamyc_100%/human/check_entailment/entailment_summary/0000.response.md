Reasoning:
The given program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating how many ships are sunk after the Kraken's attacks. However, there is a fundamental flaw in the logic of the provided function `func_1`.

The function incorrectly calculates the number of ships sunk by using cumulative sums and thresholds (`s_a` and `s_b` compared to `a` and `b` respectively). This approach does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships until they sink.

The logic should involve simulating the attack process, decrementing the durability of the first and last ships in turn, and removing them from consideration once they sink. The provided function does not account for the alternating attack pattern correctly and does not accurately reflect the number of ships sunk.

For example, in the case of `n=4, k=5, a=[1, 2, 4, 3]`, the correct simulation would be:
1. Attack the first ship (durability becomes 0, remove it).
2. Attack the last ship (durability becomes 2, do not remove it).
3. Attack the new first ship (durability becomes 1, do not remove it).
4. Attack the last ship (durability becomes 1, do not remove it).
5. Attack the first ship (durability becomes 0, remove it).

After these attacks, 2 ships have sunk, which matches the first example in the problem statement. However, the given function would not produce this result.

Correctness: **False**
