The code snippet assigns the minimum and maximum of the `i`th elements of `a` and `b` to `x` and `y` respectively, after converting them to integers. Given that the `i`th elements of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` will be the smaller of the two digits, and `y` will be the larger of the two digits.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `kq1` is an empty string; `kq2` is an empty string; `vt` is 0; `i` is 0; `x` is the minimum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to integers; `y` is the maximum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to integers.**
