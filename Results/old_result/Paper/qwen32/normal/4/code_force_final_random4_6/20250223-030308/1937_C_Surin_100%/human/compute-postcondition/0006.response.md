To determine the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop will execute for `i` starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. This means the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute because the range `(1, n)` will be empty.

2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. We can adjust these variables to ensure the loop executes.

3. **Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts because it is automatically initialized by the `range` function.

4. **Adjusting `n`**: To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1. The current state does not specify a value for `n`, so we need to ensure `n` is set to a value greater than 1.

5. **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `g`, and `v1` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 1. The values of `t`, `g`, and `v1` remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0**
