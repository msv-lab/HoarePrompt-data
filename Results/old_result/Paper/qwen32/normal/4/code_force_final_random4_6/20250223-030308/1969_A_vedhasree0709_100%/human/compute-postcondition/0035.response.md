The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`, which means that the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided by the input. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is `0`.**
