Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the first element, the element at index `g`, and the element at index `d` have been decreased by 3, `g` is incremented by 2 if `a[g]` was 0 after the first decrement, `d` is decremented by 1 if `a[d]` was 0 after the first decrement, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space minus 1, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space and remains unchanged, `k` is at least 2 and not equal to any of the specified forbidden values, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the variable `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[g]` was 0 after the first decrement, `g` is incremented by an additional 1, making it a total increment of 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
