You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < 2^30. For each query, l and r are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0; `n` and `q` are the integers from the last test case processed; `a` is the list of integers from the last test case processed; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is the position in `data` after processing all test cases; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the queries from all test cases, either 'YES' or 'NO'.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: 'YES\nNO\nYES\n...' (where each line is either 'YES' or 'NO' corresponding to the results of the queries from all test cases)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each integer in the list `a` satisfies the condition `0 <= a_i < 2^30`. For each query, it accepts two integers `l` and `r` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`. The function processes these inputs and returns the result of each query, which is not specified in detail here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
