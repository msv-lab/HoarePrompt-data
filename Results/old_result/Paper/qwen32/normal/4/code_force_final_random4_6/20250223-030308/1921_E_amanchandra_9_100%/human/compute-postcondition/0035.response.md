To determine what will be printed, let's break down the code step by step using the given initial state.

### Given Variables:
- `t`: An input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `_`: Incremented by 1 (not directly used in the print statement)
- `r`: Calculated as `min(w, d + x)`
- `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`: Integers read from the input
- `x`: Calculated as `abs(a - c) // 2`
- `l`: Calculated as `max(1, d - x)`

### Key Calculations:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   \[
   x = \frac{|a - c|}{2}
   \]
   - `x` is the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2.

2. **Calculate `r`:**
   \[
   r = \min(w, d + x)
   \]
   - `r` is the minimum value between `w` and `d + x`.

3. **Calculate `l`:**
   \[
   l = \max(1, d - x)
   \]
   - `l` is the maximum value between 1 and `d - x`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement uses a conditional expression to select between two lists:
- `['Draw']` if the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is `False`
- `['Alice']` if the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is `True`

### Condition Breakdown:
- `abs(l - b) <= x + 1`: This checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
- `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`: This checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `b` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

### Output Determination:
The output depends on whether both conditions are `True`:
- If both `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are `True`, the output will be `['Alice']`.
- Otherwise, the output will be `['Draw']`.

### Final Output Description:
Based on the given initial state and the calculations, the output of the print statement will be either `['Alice']` or `['Draw']` depending on the values of `l`, `r`, `b`, and `x`.

Output: **['Alice'] if abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1, otherwise ['Draw']**
