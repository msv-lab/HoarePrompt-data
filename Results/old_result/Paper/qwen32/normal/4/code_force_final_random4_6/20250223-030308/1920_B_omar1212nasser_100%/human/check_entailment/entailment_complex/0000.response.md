### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It then sorts the list `a`.

2. **Computing the Result:**
   - The function `func_2` is called with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - `func_2` calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their optimal moves.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice removes at most `k` elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob multiplies at most `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
   - The function `func_2` considers all possible numbers of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `k`).
   - For each number of elements Alice removes, it calculates the sum of the remaining elements and adjusts it based on the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1.

4. **Detailed Steps in `func_2`:**
   - It initializes the sum `s` of all elements in the array.
   - It calculates the sum `s2` of the last `x` elements (these are the candidates for Bob to multiply by -1).
   - It computes the initial value of `pos` as `s - 2 * s2` (this accounts for the sum of the array minus twice the sum of the elements Bob can flip, because flipping an element twice cancels out the effect).
   - It iteratively removes elements from the end of the sorted list (these are the smallest elements, which Alice should remove to maximize the sum).
   - For each removal, it updates `s` and `s2` and appends the new value of `s - 2 * s2` to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`, which represents the best possible sum after both players make their optimal moves.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the described strategy. It ensures that Alice removes the smallest elements to maximize the sum, and it considers all possible numbers of elements Bob can flip to minimize the sum. The calculations and logic in `func_2` are consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after both Alice and Bob make their optimal moves.
