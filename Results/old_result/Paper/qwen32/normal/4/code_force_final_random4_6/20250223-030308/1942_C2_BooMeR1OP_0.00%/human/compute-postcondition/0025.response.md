Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, `gaps` is an empty list, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`**

Explanation: The variable `next_elem` is calculated based on the given expression, but the values of `ans`, `gaps`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
