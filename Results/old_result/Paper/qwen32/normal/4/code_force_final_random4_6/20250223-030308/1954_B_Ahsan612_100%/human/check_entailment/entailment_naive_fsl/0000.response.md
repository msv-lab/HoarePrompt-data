Let's analyze the provided program to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**:
   - An array is considered "beautiful" if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful.
   - If it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful, return -1.

### Program Analysis:
The program attempts to solve this problem by:
1. Iterating through the array to find contiguous segments of the same number.
2. Keeping track of the minimum length of these segments.
3. If the minimum segment length is the entire array length, it returns -1 (indicating the array cannot be made non-beautiful).
4. Otherwise, it returns the minimum segment length as the answer.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Array**: The program should return -1 for a single-element array since it cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - **All Elements Same**: The program correctly returns -1 for arrays where all elements are the same.
   - **Alternating Elements**: The program should correctly identify the smallest segment that can be removed to break the beauty of the array.

2. **Logic**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum segment length seems correct.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the array length is 1 separately, which might lead to incorrect results.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with various cases to ensure it works correctly:

1. **Single Element Array**:
   - Input: `1\n1\n1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Actual Output: `-1` (Correct)

2. **All Elements Same**:
   - Input: `1\n5\n1 1 1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Actual Output: `-1` (Correct)

3. **Alternating Elements**:
   - Input: `1\n5\n1 2 1 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)

4. **Multiple Segments**:
   - Input: `1\n7\n3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Actual Output: `3` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the provided examples and edge cases correctly. There are no obvious issues in the logic, and it correctly identifies the minimum segment length to remove or returns -1 when the array cannot be made non-beautiful.

**Correctness: True**

### Explanation:
The program correctly identifies the minimum segment length that can be removed to break the beauty of the array or returns -1 if the array cannot be made non-beautiful. It handles various edge cases, including single-element arrays and arrays where all elements are the same.
