### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of wins the cow at position `k` can achieve, either by staying in its position or by swapping with another cow once.

However, there are several issues with the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the parameter `l`, which is the list of cow ratings. However, `func_1` is defined to take a list of tuples, which contradicts the usage in the main loop. The function should be modified to accept a list of ratings directly.

2. **Global Variable Usage:**
   - The variable `n` is used inside `func_1` without being passed as an argument. This will lead to a `NameError` because `n` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`.

3. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic to determine the maximum number of wins is flawed. The function is trying to find the indices of the first two cows with higher ratings and then making decisions based on these indices. However, this does not correctly account for all possible scenarios, especially when considering the optimal swap position.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not correctly handle edge cases where the cow at position `k` has the highest rating or where the cow at position `k` can win all matches if swapped optimally.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the program is not correct. It does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k` either by staying in its position or by swapping with another cow once.

**Correctness: False**
