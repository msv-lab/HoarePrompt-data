The code snippet `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, we can calculate the new value of `res` as follows:

1. Calculate the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`:
   - `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15`
2. Add this result to `res`:
   - `res` was initially 7, so `res` becomes `7 + 15 = 22`

The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and the initial value of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 22, `i` is 2**
