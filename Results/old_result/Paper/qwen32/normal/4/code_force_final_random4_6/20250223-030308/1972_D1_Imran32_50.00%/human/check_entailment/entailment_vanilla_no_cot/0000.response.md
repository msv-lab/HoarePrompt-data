Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The function `func_1` appears to be calculating something related to divisors or square roots, but it does not implement the logic required to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and check whether the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) is satisfied. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This program correctly implements the logic to count the valid pairs for each test case. However, this approach may not be efficient enough given the constraints (up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\) for the sum of \(n\) and \(m\)). A more optimized approach would be necessary for such large inputs, potentially involving number-theoretic insights or optimizations.
