### Reasoning:

The provided solution is designed to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized by making at most \( 3n \) queries. Let's break down the logic and correctness of the provided functions.

#### Function `func_1(a, b, c, d)`:
- This function sends a query to the interactor asking for the comparison result of \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).
- It returns the result of this comparison, which can be `<`, `>`, or `=`.

#### Function `func_2(n)`:
- **Finding `max_item_idx`**:
  - The function iterates through all indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) and uses `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` to determine if the current `max_item_idx` is smaller than index `i` when compared using bitwise OR.
  - If the result is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
  - This process ensures that `max_item_idx` is the index of the maximum element in the permutation based on bitwise OR.
- **Finding `pair_idx`**:
  - The function then iterates through all indices to find the best `pair_idx` that maximizes the XOR with `max_item_idx`.
  - For each index `i`, it compares \( (p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx}) \) and \( (p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_i) \).
  - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
  - If the result is `=`, it performs an additional comparison to ensure that `pair_idx` is indeed the maximum element when compared with itself.
- **Output**:
  - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` which are expected to maximize the XOR operation.

### Analysis:
- The logic for finding `max_item_idx` is correct as it ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the maximum element in terms of bitwise OR.
- The logic for finding `pair_idx` is also correct as it ensures that `pair_idx` is the best possible index to pair with `max_item_idx` to maximize the XOR.
- The number of queries made by the function is \( 2n - 1 \) (one for finding `max_item_idx` and one for each comparison to find `pair_idx`), which is well within the limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the pair of indices that maximize the XOR operation within the allowed number of queries.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The solution correctly identifies the indices that maximize the XOR operation by first finding the maximum element in terms of bitwise OR and then finding the best pair to maximize the XOR. The number of queries is within the allowed limit.
Correctness: **True**
