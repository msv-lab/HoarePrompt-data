Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integer scores in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it determines and prints a specific value based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even and the highest score is at least the sum of the other two scores, it prints the sum of the two lower scores. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the largest possible value that satisfies a certain condition involving the scores, or the highest score if no such value exists.**
