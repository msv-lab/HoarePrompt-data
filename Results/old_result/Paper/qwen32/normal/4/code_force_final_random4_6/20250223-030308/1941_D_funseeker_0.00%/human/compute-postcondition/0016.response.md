The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. This element is calculated as `(q - r) % n`. Since `temp` already contains `((q + r) % n)` if `c` was '1' or '?', and potentially `((q - r) % n)` if `c` was originally '1' or '?', adding `(q - r) % n` will not change `temp` if `c` was already '1' or '?'. If `c` was originally '0' or '?', `temp` will now contain both `((q + r) % n)` and `((q - r) % n)`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the values `x` and potentially other values, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans` that hasn't been processed yet. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the elements `((q + r) % n)` and `((q - r) % n)`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', `temp` contains `((q - r) % n)`.**
