The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to both `st` and `end`. This means that the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start (`st`) and from the end (`end`) is now `1`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 1; `ans` retains its original value, which is `le - max(st, end)` if the first and last elements of `a` are not equal, or `max(0, le - (st + end))` if they are equal.**
