To determine the output, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is some value (the exact value is not provided).
- `prev` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1 (the exact value of `n` is not provided).
- The variables `v1` and `i` are not explicitly defined in the initial state.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is a formatted string that includes the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1` again, and `prev`.
- `prev` is explicitly given as 0.
- `v1` and `i` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can include them in the output description as variables.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output a string starting with a question mark followed by the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1` again, and `prev` (which is 0).

Since `v1` and `i` are not provided, we describe them as variables with unknown values.

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] 0 (where v1 and i are variables with unknown values)**
