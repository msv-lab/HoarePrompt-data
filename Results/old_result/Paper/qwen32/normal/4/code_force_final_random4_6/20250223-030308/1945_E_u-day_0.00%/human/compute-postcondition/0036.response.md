To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop is essentially performing a binary search to find the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, but in a way that is not typical for binary search since it does not directly update `pos`. Instead, it narrows down the range defined by `low` and `high` and records the midpoints in the set `st`.

The loop continues until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. This means that the loop will terminate when the range defined by `low` and `high` is reduced to a single element.

Given the behavior described in the problem, the final state of `low` and `high` will be such that `low` and `high` are consecutive indices, and `mid` will have been the last midpoint calculated before the loop terminates. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the loop.

Since the loop narrows down the range by half in each iteration, the final values of `low` and `high` will be two consecutive indices that define the smallest possible range that could contain `k`. The value of `pos` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is not updated within the loop.

### Final Output State:
- `pos` remains the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` and `high` will be two consecutive indices such that `low + 1 == high`, defining the smallest possible range that could contain `k`.
- `st` will be a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop.

### Natural Language Explanation:
The loop will continue to narrow down the search range until it is as small as possible, consisting of two consecutive indices. The variable `pos` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints that were calculated during the iterations of the loop.

Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` and `high` are two consecutive indices such that `low + 1 == high`; `st` is a set containing all the midpoints calculated during the loop.**
