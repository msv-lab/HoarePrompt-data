### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it meets the problem requirements and achieves the desired outcome.

1. **Calculation of the Sum:**
   - The program calculates the sum `s` for each test case. This sum is essentially the sum of the first `n` cubes, which can be derived from the formula:
     \[
     s = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2
     \]
   - The program's loop calculates this sum in a different manner, but it should yield the same result:
     ```python
     sum = 1
     for i in range(2, n + 1):
         sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
     This loop is effectively adding up the cubes of numbers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program prints `2 * n` operations. Each operation is either of Type 1 or Type 2, and it applies a permutation `p` to either a row or a column.
   - The operations are defined as follows:
     ```python
     for j in range(1, n + 1):
         print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
         print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
     - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, it first applies a Type 1 operation on row `n - j + 1` and then a Type 2 operation on column `n - j + 1`. The permutation used is simply the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Verification of the Operations:**
   - The operations described in the code will fill the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum of its elements. Specifically, the sequence of operations will ensure that each row and each column is filled with the numbers from 1 to `n` in some order, which maximizes the sum.
   - The Type 1 and Type 2 operations, when applied in the manner described, will result in a matrix where each number from 1 to `n` appears exactly `n` times, leading to the maximum possible sum.

4. **Number of Operations:**
   - The program ensures that the number of operations is `2 * n`, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and outputs the operations required to achieve this sum within the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
