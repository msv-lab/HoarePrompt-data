The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line. According to the initial state, `r` is a list containing the results of processing each test case. Each test case contributes either a 0 (if `bx > ax`) or the count of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` excluding those in `cx` (if `bx <= ax`).

To break it down:
- If `bx > ax`, the result for that test case is `0`.
- If `bx <= ax`, the result for that test case is the count of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` excluding those in `cx`.

Since the exact values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` for each test case are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values in the list `r`. However, we know the structure and logic behind the values in `r`.

Therefore, the output will be each element of the list `r` printed on a new line, where each element is either `0` or the count of integers in a specified range excluding certain values.

Output: **Each element of the list `r` on a new line, where each element is either 0 or the count of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` excluding those in `cx` for each test case.**
