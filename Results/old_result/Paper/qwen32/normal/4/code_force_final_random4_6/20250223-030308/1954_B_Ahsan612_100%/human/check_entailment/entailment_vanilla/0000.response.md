Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array with all identical elements using a specific operation (replacing an element with its adjacent identical element). The goal is to identify the smallest group of consecutive identical elements and remove it, unless all elements are identical, in which case it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.

### Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating through the array and counting consecutive identical elements. It keeps track of the smallest group of consecutive identical elements (`minn`). If all elements are identical, it outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the size of the smallest group.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of the current group of identical elements.
   - `num` is set to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is set to infinity to find the minimum length of any group of identical elements.
   
2. **Iteration**:
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as the previous one, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different from the previous one:
     - It increments the index (`i`) and updates `num` to the current element.
     - It updates `minn` with the minimum of its current value and `same`.
     - It resets `same` to 1 for the new group.
   - The index `i` is incremented again to move to the next element.

3. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time to account for the last group of identical elements.

4. **Output**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it means all elements are identical, and the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`, the size of the smallest group of identical elements.

### Correctness Evaluation
The logic of the program is correct for the problem statement. It correctly identifies the smallest group of consecutive identical elements and determines whether the array is entirely composed of identical elements.

#### Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `3 2 2 2`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: All elements are identical, so it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   
2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `5 1 2 1 2 1`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing any single element (e.g., the middle `2`) makes the array non-beautiful.
   
3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: Single element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful.
   
4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Removing the first three `3`s results in a non-beautiful array.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or determine that it's impossible.

**Correctness: True**
