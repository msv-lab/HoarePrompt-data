The code snippet increments the value of `end` by 1. Therefore, `end` will now be `end + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is `k-1` where `k` is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`
- `r` is `l`
- `st` is `k`
- `end` is 3
- `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`

After executing `end += 1`, the new value of `end` will be 4.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input with the last two elements being equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `k-1` where `k` is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`, `r` is `l`, `st` is `k`, `end` is 4, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`**

In simple terms, the value of `end` has been incremented by 1, making it 4, while all other variables remain unchanged.
