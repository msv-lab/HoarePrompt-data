Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers corresponding to the input values; `r` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `r` is a string containing the value of `a[x]`; `x` is the index of `n` in the list `s`; `b[x]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `r` is a string containing the value of `a[x]` concatenated with the value of `a[x]` again; `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`; `b[x]` is incremented by 1; `i` is the next element in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `r` is the original `r` concatenated with `a[x]` again, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1, `i` is the next element in the list `s`. `b[x]` has been incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
