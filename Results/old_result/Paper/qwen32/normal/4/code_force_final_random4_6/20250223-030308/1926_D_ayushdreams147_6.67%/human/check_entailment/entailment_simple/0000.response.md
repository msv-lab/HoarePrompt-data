Reasoning: The given program is attempting to solve the problem by using a dictionary to count occurrences of numbers and their "flipped" counterparts. However, the logic within the function `func_1` is incorrect for determining the minimum number of groups required.

The key requirement of the problem is that no two numbers in the same group can share any bit values among their least significant 31 bits. This means that each bit position from 1 to 31 must be unique across all numbers in the same group.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it uses a bitwise XOR operation with `(1 << 31) - 1` to flip all the bits of the number, but this operation does not help in determining the minimum number of groups required based on the problem's constraints.

A correct approach would involve checking each bit position across all numbers and determining the maximum number of groups required by considering the distribution of bits. Specifically, for each bit position, the maximum number of groups required would be the maximum number of times any bit value (0 or 1) appears across all numbers at that position.

Given the incorrect logic in the provided function, the program will not produce the correct results for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
