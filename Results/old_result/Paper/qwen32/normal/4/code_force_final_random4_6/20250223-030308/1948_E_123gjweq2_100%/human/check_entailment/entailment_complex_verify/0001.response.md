### Reasoning:

Let's review the original assessment and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
1. **Assign distinct integers from 1 to n to the vertices of a graph.**
2. **Add edges between vertices (i, j) if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| â‰¤ k.**
3. **Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.**
4. **Print the assignments, the number of cliques, and the partitioning.**

#### Program Analysis Recap:

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Assign values to vertices, determine the number of cliques, and print the required outputs.
   - **Issues**:
     - **Global Variables**: Uses global variables `arr` and `cliquess` without defining them within the functions.
     - **Incorrect Clique Calculation**: Calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required.
     - **Incorrect Array Population**: Does not correctly populate the array `arr` and `cliquess` to ensure the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
     - **Output Format**: Prints output directly from within the function.

2. **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Populate the array with values and assign clique numbers.
   - **Issues**:
     - **Incorrect Array Population**: The function does not ensure that the graph formed by these values can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **State Analysis**:
  - **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
    - **State Before Function Call**: `n` and `k` are valid integers within the given constraints.
    - **State Inside Function**:
      - `cliques` is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
      - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized as lists of zeros.
      - The `make_array` function is called for each segment of `k` elements.
      - After the loop, `arr` and `cliquess` are printed.
    - **State After Function Call**: The function prints the values of `arr`, `cliques`, and `cliquess`.

  - **Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
    - **State Before Function Call**: `left`, `right`, and `clique` are valid integers.
    - **State Inside Function**:
      - `small_element` and `big_element` are calculated.
      - `mid` and `not_mid` are calculated.
      - The first half of the segment is filled with ascending values.
      - The second half of the segment is filled with descending values.
      - All elements in the segment are assigned the same clique number.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment identified several issues with the program:
- **Global Variables**: The use of global variables `arr` and `cliquess` is problematic.
- **Incorrect Clique Calculation**: The calculation of `ceil(n / k)` does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques.
- **Incorrect Array Population**: The way `arr` and `cliquess` are populated does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

The annotations confirm that the program does not correctly populate `arr` and `cliquess` to ensure the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The function `make_array` fills segments with alternating ascending and descending values, but this does not guarantee that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in the original assessment and confirmed by the annotations, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Final: False**
