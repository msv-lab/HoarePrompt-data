The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to have executed. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` should still be greater than 0 after the previous iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `num_tests` remains greater than 0.

State: **`start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last number in `nums` that is greater than the cumulative effect of all previous iterations, effectively the least common multiple (LCM) of all numbers in `nums` adjusted by the loop's logic, and `num_tests` must be greater than 0**.
