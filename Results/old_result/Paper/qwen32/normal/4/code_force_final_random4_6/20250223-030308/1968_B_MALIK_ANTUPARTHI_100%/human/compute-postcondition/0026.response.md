To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the given code snippet on the variables. The code snippet is:

```python
k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
```

Here's the breakdown of what this code does:
- `d[j]` retrieves the `j`-th character of the string `d`.
- `e[k:]` slices the string `e` starting from index `k` to the end.
- `.index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the sliced string `e[k:]`.
- `+ 1` adjusts the index to be 1-based instead of 0-based.
- `+ k` shifts the index to be relative to the original string `e` rather than the sliced version.

Thus, `k` is updated to the position of the `j`-th character of `d` in `e`, starting from the current `k` position.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5
- `a` is an integer greater than 0
- `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0
- `c` is an integer read from input
- `d` is an input string
- `e` is a string read from input
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value

The only variable that changes is `k`, as it is reassigned a new value based on the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is an integer read from input; `d` is an input string; `e` is a string read from input; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `k` is the position of the `j`-th character of `d` in `e`, starting from the current `k` position.**
