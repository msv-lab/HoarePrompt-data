You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.

    #State: t is 0, n, f, k, a, and x are the values from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines and prints whether the `k`-th largest element in the sorted list is greater than, less than, or potentially equal to the element at index `f` in the original list. The output for each test case is either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to ensure it adheres to the problem description for every potential case.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it performs the following steps:
1. Reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of cubes to be removed `k`.
2. Reads the values on the cubes.
3. Identifies the value of the favorite cube.
4. Sorts the cubes in non-increasing order.
5. Compares the value of the favorite cube with the value of the cube at the `k`-th position after sorting.
6. Determines whether the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left.

### Potential Cases to Test

1. **Favorite Cube is Removed in All Cases:**
   - The value of the favorite cube is less than the value of the cube at the `k`-th position after sorting.
   
2. **Favorite Cube is Not Removed in Any Case:**
   - The value of the favorite cube is greater than the value of the cube at the `k`-th position after sorting.
   
3. **Favorite Cube May Be Either Removed or Left:**
   - The value of the favorite cube is equal to the value of the cube at the `k`-th position after sorting.
   - The cube at the `k`-th position is not the last cube, and the cube at the `(k+1)`-th position has a value less than the favorite cube.

### Verification

Let's verify the program against these cases.

1. **Favorite Cube is Removed in All Cases:**
   - If `a[k] > x`, the program correctly prints "NO".
   
2. **Favorite Cube is Not Removed in Any Case:**
   - If `a[k] < x`, the program correctly prints "YES".
   
3. **Favorite Cube May Be Either Removed or Left:**
   - If `a[k] == x` and `k == n - 1` or `a[k + 1] < x`, the program correctly prints "MAYBE".

### Edge Cases

- **When `k` is equal to `n`:**
  - This means all cubes are removed, and the favorite cube will always be removed. The program should handle this correctly by printing "YES".
- **When `f` is 1 and `k` is 1:**
  - This means the first cube after sorting is removed. The program should handle this correctly by comparing the first cube after sorting with the favorite cube.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that it correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios that the program does not address properly.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies whether the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left, for all potential test cases as described in the problem statement.
