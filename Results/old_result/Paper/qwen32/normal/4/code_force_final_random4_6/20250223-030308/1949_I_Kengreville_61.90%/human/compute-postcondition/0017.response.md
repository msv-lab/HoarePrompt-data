Postcondition: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and `visited[j]` is True. `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is False and `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, then `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`, and the function `dfs(j)` has been called. Otherwise, no changes are made to `coef0[j]`, `coef1[j]`, or the function `dfs(j)` is not called.**
