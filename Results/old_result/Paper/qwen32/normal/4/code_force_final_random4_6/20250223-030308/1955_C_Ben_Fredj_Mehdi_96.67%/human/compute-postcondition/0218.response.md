Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces.
3. `z` is incremented by 1 (though `z` is not used in the provided code snippet).
4. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
5. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('200')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'200'`.
- The variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` are defined based on the initial state but are not used in the provided code snippet.
- Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'200'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k`, the output will always be `'200'`.

### Output:
Output: **200**
