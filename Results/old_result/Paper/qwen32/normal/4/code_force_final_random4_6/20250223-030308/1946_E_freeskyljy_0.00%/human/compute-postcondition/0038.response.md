Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n. `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n. `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input. `L` is a list of integers read from the input. `R` is a list of integers read from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`. If `M1` is greater than 1, `cur` is `M1 - 3` if `L[-1] - 3` was in `L` during the loop, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 2`; `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`; `i` is `2`; `ans` is the product of all `nums_left` values encountered during the loop, taken modulo `MOD`. If `M1` is not greater than 1, `cur` remains `M1 - 2` and `ans` is the binomial coefficient `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the if-else block, taking into account the conditions and updates specified in both the if and else parts.
