Postcondition: **`t` is either 0 or 1; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of integers; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`; `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. If `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
