Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description
The task is to determine the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. A sequence `a` is a subsequence of a sequence `b` if `a` can be obtained from `b` by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

### Program Analysis
Here is the provided program:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
```

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's go through the program step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `k` is initialized to 0, representing the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, representing the current index in string `b`.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over each character in string `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`).

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner `while` loop searches for the current character of `a` in string `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If the character `a[i]` is found in `b` at index `j`, it increments `k` (indicating that this character can be part of the subsequence) and increments `j` to move to the next character in `b`.
   - If the character `a[i]` is not found in the remaining part of `b` (i.e., `j` reaches `m`), the loop breaks, as no further characters of `a` can form a subsequence.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the value of `k` is printed, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Testing Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases to ensure the program handles them correctly:

1. **All Characters Match**:
   - `a = "100"`, `b = "100"`.
   - Expected Output: `3`.
   - The program correctly outputs `3`.

2. **No Characters Match**:
   - `a = "111"`, `b = "000"`.
   - Expected Output: `0`.
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

3. **Partial Match**:
   - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`.
   - Expected Output: `2`.
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.

4. **Single Character Match**:
   - `a = "1"`, `b = "111"`.
   - Expected Output: `1`.
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

5. **Single Character No Match**:
   - `a = "1"`, `b = "0"`.
   - Expected Output: `0`.
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

6. **Empty Prefix**:
   - `a = ""`, `b = "111"`.
   - Expected Output: `0` (though the problem specifies `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5`, this edge case is not explicitly tested but logically should return `0` if `a` is empty).
   - The program would not handle this case as it assumes `n` is at least 1.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the given problem description for the provided examples and edge cases. It correctly identifies the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. 

However, the problem specifies that `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5`, and the program does not handle the case where `a` is an empty string, which is not explicitly mentioned but logically should return `0` if `a` is empty. Since the problem description specifies `1 <= n`, this edge case is not relevant here.

Therefore, based on the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**.
