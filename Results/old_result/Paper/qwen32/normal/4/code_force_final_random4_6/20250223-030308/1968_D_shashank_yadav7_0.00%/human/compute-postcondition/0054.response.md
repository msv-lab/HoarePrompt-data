The code snippet provided updates the variable `p` by reading a list of integers from the input. None of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `a`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) are directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is the number of iterations completed (min(n, number of iterations until `k` becomes 0)) + 1; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `b` is the third integer from the input; `s` is the fourth integer from the input; `p` is a list of integers from the input; `a` remains unchanged; `bm` is updated `i` times to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated `i` times to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `i` iterations; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `i` iterations; `bm` is either less than `sm` or greater than or equal to `sm`.**
