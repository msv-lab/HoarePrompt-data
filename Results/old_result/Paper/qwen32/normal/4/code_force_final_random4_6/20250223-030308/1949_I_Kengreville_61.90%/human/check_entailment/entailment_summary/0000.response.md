Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to determine whether it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks such that disks that were tangent remain tangent, no two disks overlap, and the sum of the radii strictly decreases. Let's analyze the logic and implementation of the given functions to see if they correctly address the problem.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The main function `func_1()` reads the number of disks `n` and initializes arrays `x`, `y`, `r` for storing the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - It also initializes arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to manage the DFS process and store coefficients for each disk.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The DFS function `dfs(i)` starts from a disk `i` and explores all disks that are tangent to it (i.e., where the distance between centers equals the sum of radii).
   - During the DFS, it marks disks as visited, and updates `coef0` and `coef1` for each disk based on the tangency condition. These coefficients are used to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii as required.
   - The DFS ensures that all disks in the same connected component of tangencies are processed together.

3. **Checking the Condition:**
   - After the DFS completes for each unvisited disk, the main function `func_1()` checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the nodes in the current connected component is non-zero (`c1 != 0`).
   - If this condition holds for any connected component, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to adjust the radii as required. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic of the DFS and the condition check (`c1 != 0`) is based on the idea that if the sum of `coef1` values is non-zero, there exists a way to adjust the radii to meet the problem constraints.
   - However, the provided code does not explicitly ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. The condition `c1 != 0` might be a heuristic or a necessary but not sufficient condition for the problem.
   - The problem requires that the sum of radii strictly decreases, and the provided code does not explicitly address this requirement.

Given the above analysis, while the code seems to follow a logical approach to detecting connected components of tangent disks and checking a condition related to the problem, it does not guarantee that the sum of the radii will strictly decrease, which is a crucial requirement of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the provided implementation based on the problem description is questionable.

Correctness: **False**
