### Reasoning:
Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move can either add one cube or remove one cube.
- The initial number of cubes is 0.

#### Key Observations:
1. **If `n` (number of moves) equals `m` (number of cubes):**
   - We can simply add one cube in each of the `n` moves to reach `m` cubes.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing 'YES'.

2. **If `n` is less than `m`:**
   - It's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves because each move can add at most one cube.
   - The program correctly handles this case by printing 'NO'.

3. **If `n` is greater than `m`:**
   - We need to consider if we can reach `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes.
   - The key observation here is that the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` matters:
     - If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it's possible to reach `m` cubes by carefully adding and removing cubes.
     - If `n` and `m` have different parities, it's impossible to reach `m` cubes because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
- For each test case, it reads `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes).
- It then checks:
  - If `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES'.
  - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'.
  - If `b` and `c` have the same parity, it prints 'Yes'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly implements the logic described above. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
