Postcondition: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the deque `q`, `q` has the first element `ver` followed by the previous elements of `q` and now includes `node` at the end if `vis[node]` was 0. `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, and `vis[node]` is 1 after the execution if `vis[node]` was 0. `graph[ver]` must have at least one node. If `vis[node]` was already 1, `q` and `vis` remain unchanged.**
