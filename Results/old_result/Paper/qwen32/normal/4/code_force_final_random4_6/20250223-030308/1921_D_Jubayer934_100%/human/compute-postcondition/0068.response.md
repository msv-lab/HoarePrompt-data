Output State: **`temp` is -1; `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `temp - 1` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n - 1` if `temp` is not -1, otherwise `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `n - 1`; `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input.**

In this output state, the value of `temp` is set to -1, and the contents of `ans` remain as described based on the initial conditions. The values of `n` and `m` are unchanged and still hold the values read from the input.
