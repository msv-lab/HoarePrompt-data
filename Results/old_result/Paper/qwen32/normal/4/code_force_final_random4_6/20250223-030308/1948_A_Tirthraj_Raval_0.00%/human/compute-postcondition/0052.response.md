Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
2. `n` is another input integer.
3. `pattern` is a list with \(2 \times \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\) elements where the elements alternate between 'A' and 'B'.

### Key Points:
- The length of the `pattern` list is \(2 \times \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\). This means the length is always even, specifically \(n\) if `n` is even.
- If `n` is odd, the length of the `pattern` list would be \(n - 1\) because the pattern only contains pairs of 'A' and 'B'.
- The elements in the `pattern` list alternate between 'A' and 'B'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(pattern))
```

### Analysis:
- The `join` method concatenates all the elements of the `pattern` list into a single string.
- Since the `pattern` list alternates between 'A' and 'B', the resulting string will also alternate between 'A' and 'B'.

### Examples:
- If `n = 4`, the `pattern` list would be `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`, and the output would be `'ABAB'`.
- If `n = 5`, the `pattern` list would be `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']` (since the length is \(2 \times \left(\frac{5}{2}\right) = 4\)), and the output would be `'ABAB'`.

### General Case:
- For any even `n`, the `pattern` list will have `n` elements, alternating between 'A' and 'B'.
- For any odd `n`, the `pattern` list will have `n - 1` elements, alternating between 'A' and 'B'.

### Final Output:
The output will be a string of 'A's and 'B's that alternates, with a length of \(2 \times \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\).

Output: **a string of 'A's and 'B's that alternates, with a length of \(2 \times \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\)**
