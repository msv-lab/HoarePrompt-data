The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans2` to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first x elements of a)` plus `a[x]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first x elements of a)`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged as the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first x elements of a)` plus `a[x]`. `k` must be greater than 0; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**
