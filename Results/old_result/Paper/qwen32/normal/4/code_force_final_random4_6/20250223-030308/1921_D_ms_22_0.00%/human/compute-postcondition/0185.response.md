The code snippet pushes a new tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto `max_heap`. Given the initial state, `max_heap` already contains a tuple, and now it will contain one more tuple.

Here's the updated state:

- `max_heap` now contains two tuples. The first tuple is `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` was greater than `diff2` before, otherwise it was `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. The second tuple is `(-diff1, i, 0)`, which has just been pushed.
- All other variables (`tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `diff1`, `diff2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains two tuples, the first being `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` was greater than `diff2` before, otherwise `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, and the second being `(-diff1, i, 0)`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with at least one element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `i` is the next element in `a` if there are more elements to process, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
