The code calculates the sum of the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. The initial conditions about `n` and the elements of `a` remain unchanged, except that `total_water` now holds the specific value of the sum of the elements in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`.**
