Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 3`, `i` is 2, `k` is 0, and `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `y` is either 0 or `n - 2`, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, and `r` is `a[3]`.**
