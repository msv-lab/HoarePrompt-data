To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided.

### Initial State and Conditions:
1. **t**: An integer input such that \(0 \leq t \leq 499\).
2. **p1, p2, p3**: Integers obtained from the input.
3. **Sum of p1, p2, and p3**: Odd.
4. **low**: The minimum of \(p3 - p1\) and \(p3 - p2\).
5. **high**: Must be at least `cur`.
6. **cur**: 
   - If \(p1 - \text{cur} \leq p2 - (p3 - \text{cur})\), then `cur` remains equal to `low`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.

### Analysis:
The value of `cur` is dependent on the comparison between \(p1 - \text{cur}\) and \(p2 - (p3 - \text{cur})\). However, the value of `cur` is not explicitly given in the initial state, so we need to infer its value based on the conditions.

Let's break down the conditions:
- `low` is the minimum of \(p3 - p1\) and \(p3 - p2\).
- `cur` is initially set to `low` if \(p1 - \text{cur} \leq p2 - (p3 - \text{cur})\). Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

### Determining the Output:
To determine the exact value printed, we need to consider the value of `cur`. However, since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables and the conditions given.

Given the conditions, `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`. Let's consider both cases:

1. **Case 1: \(p1 - \text{cur} \leq p2 - (p3 - \text{cur})\)**
   - In this case, `cur` remains `low`.
   - The expression becomes \(p1 - \text{low} + p3\).

2. **Case 2: \(p1 - \text{cur} > p2 - (p3 - \text{cur})\)**
   - In this case, `cur` is incremented by 1, so `cur` becomes `low + 1`.
   - The expression becomes \(p1 - (\text{low} + 1) + p3 = p1 - \text{low} + p3 - 1\).

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not provided, we cannot determine which case applies. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables and conditions.

### Final Answer:
The print statement outputs the value of \(p1 - \text{cur} + p3\), where `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` based on the given conditions.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where cur is either low or low + 1 based on the conditions given)**
