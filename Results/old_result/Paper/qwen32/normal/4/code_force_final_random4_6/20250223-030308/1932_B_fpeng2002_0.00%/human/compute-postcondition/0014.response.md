The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is greater than 0 or `num_tests` is 0 if it was initially 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, `start_year` is the result of the loop's final calculation.**
