Postcondition: **`kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was initially 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `str(x)`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with `str(y)`. If `vt` was initially 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with `str(x)`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`, and `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with `str(x)`. In all cases, `vt` is set to 1 if it was initially 0 and `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, and remains unchanged otherwise. `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is `q + 1`, `a` remains a sequence with at least one element, `b` remains the user input, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
