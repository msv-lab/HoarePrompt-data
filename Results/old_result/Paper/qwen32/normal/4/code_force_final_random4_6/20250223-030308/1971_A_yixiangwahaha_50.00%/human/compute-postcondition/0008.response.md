The code snippet `xylist = input().split(' ')` will overwrite the existing `xylist` with a new list of substrings obtained from the input, split by spaces. The variables `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `xylist` is a new list of substrings from the input split by spaces, `i` is 4.**
