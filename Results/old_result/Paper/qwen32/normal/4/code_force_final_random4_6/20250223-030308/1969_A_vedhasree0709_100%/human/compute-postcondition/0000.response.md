In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times. The variables `n` and `p` are defined within each test case, but they are not part of the loop head; they are part of the loop body. Therefore, the only variable we need to adjust to ensure the loop executes is `t`.

Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 5000`, the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. No adjustments are needed for `t` itself because it is already within the valid range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
