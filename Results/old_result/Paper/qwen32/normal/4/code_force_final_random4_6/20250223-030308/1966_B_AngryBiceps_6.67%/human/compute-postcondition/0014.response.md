The code appends a new string to the list `a` by taking an input. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is also unchanged. The list `a` now contains three strings instead of two.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is 2**.
