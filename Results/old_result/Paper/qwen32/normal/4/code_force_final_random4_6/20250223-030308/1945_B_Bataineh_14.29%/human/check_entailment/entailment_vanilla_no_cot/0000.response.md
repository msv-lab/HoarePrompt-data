Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic used in the program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. The condition `if m < a or m < b: print(2)` is not correct. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time depends on the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and how fireworks overlap within the visibility period `m`.

2. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is not accurate for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. This formula does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculate the number of fireworks visible from each installation within the visibility period `m`, taking into account the overlap.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        count_a = (m + a) // a
        count_b = (m + b) // b
        overlap = (m + lcm_ab) // lcm_ab
        print(count_a + count_b - overlap)

func()
```

This program calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation within the visibility period `m` and subtracts the overlap (fireworks that are visible at the same time due to the LCM of `a` and `b`).
