Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `kq1` is `kq1 + a[i]`; `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of `i`, `kq1`, or `kq2`. Instead, it skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
