Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is 0, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is the first new input integer, `c` is the second new input integer, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is either `e.index(d[j]) + 1` if the character at index `j` of `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, or `k` is `j` if the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`. In both cases, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second new input integer, `d` is the new input string, and `e` is the new input string. Additionally, if `k` equals `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, then either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is either `e.index(d[j]) + 1` or `j + 1`, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second new input integer, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new input string, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is specifically `j + 1`. `j` is `j + 1` in all cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `j + 1`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` was equal to `c` or `j` was equal to `b - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is set to `e.index(d[j]) + 1`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
