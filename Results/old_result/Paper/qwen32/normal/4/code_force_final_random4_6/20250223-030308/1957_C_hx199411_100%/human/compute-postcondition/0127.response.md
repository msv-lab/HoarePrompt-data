To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the initial state and the provided output states after the first three iterations. The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, decrementing `t` by 1 in each iteration.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that:

1. `t` starts as an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
2. In each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1, and the loop continues until `t` becomes 0.
3. For each iteration, `n` and `k` are read from the input, and `num` is calculated based on the values of `c` and `r`.
4. The value of `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
5. Depending on the value of `m`, the program either prints 1 or calculates and prints the value of `dp[m]` using a dynamic programming approach.

Since `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop continues until `t` becomes 0, the final state of `t` will be 0 after all iterations have finished.

The values of `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration and the calculations performed within the loop. However, since the problem does not specify the exact inputs for each iteration, we can only describe these variables in terms of their roles within the loop.

The `dp` list will be calculated and printed only if `m` is greater than 1. The exact values in the `dp` list will depend on the value of `m` and the calculations performed during each iteration.

Output State: **`t` is 0; `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` are determined by the inputs and calculations within the loop; `dp` is calculated and printed only if `m` is greater than 1.**

In natural language: After all iterations have finished, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` will be determined by the inputs and calculations performed in each iteration of the loop. The `dp` list will be calculated and printed only if `m` is greater than 1, with its values depending on the specific calculations within the loop.
