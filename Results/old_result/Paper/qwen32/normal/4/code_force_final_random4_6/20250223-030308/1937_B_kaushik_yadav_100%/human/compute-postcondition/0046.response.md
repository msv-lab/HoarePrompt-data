Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string that is being built based on the conditions described and now includes `b[i]` at the end; `i` is less than `len(a)` and has been incremented by 1; `work` is a boolean flag that determines how `ans` is updated and whether `i` is incremented.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has been increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
