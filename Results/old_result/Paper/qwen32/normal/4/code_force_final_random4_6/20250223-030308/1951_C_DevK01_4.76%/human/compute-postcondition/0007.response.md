Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `q` is calculated as the integer ceiling of the division of `k` by `m`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `L`, and `M` are still valid.
