Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob can cut an `a x b` rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. He can then rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle should be different from the original one (after considering 90-degree rotations as the same).

### Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:
1. **Cutting Along the Width (a):** If Bob cuts the rectangle along the width, he gets two rectangles of size `(a/2) x b`. For these to be rearranged into a new rectangle, `a` must be even, and the resulting rectangle should not be the same as the original (i.e., `(a/2) x b` should not be the same as `b x (a/2)` after rotation, which is always true for different `a` and `b`).
2. **Cutting Along the Height (b):** Similarly, if Bob cuts the rectangle along the height, he gets two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)`. For these to be rearranged into a new rectangle, `b` must be even, and the resulting rectangle should not be the same as the original (i.e., `a x (b/2)` should not be the same as `(b/2) x a` after rotation, which is always true for different `a` and `b`).

### Conditions for Not Forming a New Rectangle:
1. **Both Dimensions Odd:** If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. **Cut Results in Same Rectangle:** If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, the resulting rectangles after the cut would be `b x b` or `a x a`, respectively, which is the same as the original rectangle after rotation.

### Program Analysis:
The given program checks:
1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "NO".
2. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, it prints "NO".
3. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

Let's verify these conditions:
- **Condition 1 (Both Dimensions Odd):** If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
- **Condition 2 (Cut Results in Same Rectangle):** If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, the program correctly prints "NO" because the resulting rectangles after the cut would be the same as the original rectangle after rotation.
- **Otherwise:** If neither of the above conditions is met, the program correctly prints "YES" because Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can obtain a new rectangle from the given `a x b` rectangle based on the provided conditions.

**Correctness: True**
