The value of `m` is recalculated as `n - num`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration), `m` is `n - num`.**
