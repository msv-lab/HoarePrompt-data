Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The program calculates the total number of games played as `(a + b + c) // 2` because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw). Then, it calculates the maximum possible number of draws as `min(x, y)`, where `x` is the total number of games and `y` is the sum of the two lower scores.

However, the logic does not correctly account for the possibility of all games being win/loss and not allowing for the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the scores can be achieved through a valid combination of wins, losses, and draws.

Let's consider the test case `1 1 10`:
- The total points are `1 + 1 + 10 = 12`, which means `6` games were played.
- The sum of the two lower scores is `1 + 1 = 2`.
- The program outputs `min(6, 2) = 2`.

However, it is impossible to achieve the scores `1 1 10` with only 2 draws. Let's see why:
- If there are 2 draws, that accounts for `4` points (2 points per draw).
- The remaining `8` points must come from wins and losses.
- For the scores to be `1 1 10`, the player with `10` points must have won `5` games (since `5 * 2 = 10` points).
- But if one player won `5` games, the other two players must have lost `5` games in total, which contradicts the scores `1 1 10` because the other two players can only have `1` point each.

Thus, the correct output for `1 1 10` should be `-1`, indicating that these scores are not possible. The provided program does not handle this case correctly and outputs `2` instead of `-1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
