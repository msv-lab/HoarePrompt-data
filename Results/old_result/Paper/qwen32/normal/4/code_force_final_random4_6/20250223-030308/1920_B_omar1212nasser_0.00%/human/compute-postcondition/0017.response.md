The `IndexError` in the provided code could occur at the line `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the index `-(negatives + i)` or `-i` is out of bounds for the list `elements`. Specifically, if `negatives + i` or `i` is larger than the length of the list `elements`, it would lead to an `IndexError`.

Summarizing the behavior of the try-except statement:
- If the indices `-(negatives + i)` and `-i` are within the bounds of the list `elements`, the program will successfully update `n` by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]`.
- If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is set to 0.

Therefore, the output state of the program after the complete execution of the try-except statement is:
Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `s - elements[-i]`. If the indices are within bounds, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`; otherwise, `n` is 0.**
