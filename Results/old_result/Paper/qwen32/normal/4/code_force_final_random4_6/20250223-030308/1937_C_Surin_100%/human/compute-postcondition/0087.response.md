To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1.
3. `g` is initialized to 0.
4. `v1` is set to `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0.
5. `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`.
6. `kp` is incremented by 1.
7. `v2` is set to `i + 1`.
8. `r` is an input string.
9. `i` is incremented by 1.

The `print` statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

We need to determine the values of `v1` and `v2` to understand what will be printed.

- `v1` is either `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise it is 0.
- `v2` is `i + 1`.

Since the exact values of `i` and `r` are not provided, we can describe the printed output in terms of these variables:

- If `r` is `'<'`, then `v1` will be `i`.
- If `r` is not `'<'`, then `v1` will be 0.
- `v2` will always be `i + 1`.

Given these conditions, the output will be:

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [v2] [v2] (where v1 is i if r is '<', otherwise 0, and v2 is i + 1)**
