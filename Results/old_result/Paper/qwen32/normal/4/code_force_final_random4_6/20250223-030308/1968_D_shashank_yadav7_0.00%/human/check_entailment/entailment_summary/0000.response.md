Reasoning:
The provided program seems to have logical issues in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the logic for updating the scores and making the moves does not correctly simulate the game rules as described in the problem statement.

Here are the key issues:
1. The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The scores should be updated by adding `a[x]` for each player's position `x` on each turn, and then the player can choose to stay or move to `p[x]`. However, the program does not correctly implement this logic.
2. The program incorrectly uses `max` to update the scores, which is not needed based on the game rules.
3. The program does not correctly handle the case when `k` is very large (up to \(10^9\)). It attempts to simulate each turn, which is inefficient and incorrect for large `k`.
4. The program does not correctly handle the case where players might enter cycles in the permutation. The game rules do not specify what happens in such cases, but the program does not handle cycles appropriately.
5. The program does not correctly account for the fact that players can choose to stay in their current position or move to `p[x]` optimally to maximize their score.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game and determine the winner as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
