The code appends the value of `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `temp`, and `temp` is the index where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, the new element added to `ans` will be `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`.

Output State: **`temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, and `temp` is not `-1`, `n` must be greater than `temp`, `i` is `temp`, `ans` is a list of the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to and including the index `temp`, and `ans` now includes `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])` as its last element.**
