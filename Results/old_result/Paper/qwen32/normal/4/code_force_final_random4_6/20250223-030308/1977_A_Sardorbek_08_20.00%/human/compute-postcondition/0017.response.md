The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `b` is the first input integer, `c` is the second input integer, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`**
