The given code snippet `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`.
- `k` is the third integer provided by the input.
- `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input.
- `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[m-1]` removed.
- `done` is a set containing `a[m-1]` if `a[m-1]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set.
- `extra` is an empty set if `a[m-1]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains `a[m-1]`.
- `j` is `m`.
- `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

After executing `done.add(a[j])`, the set `done` will now include the element `a[j]`. Since `j` is `m`, `a[j]` is `a[m]`. Therefore, `done` will include `a[m]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`, `k` is the third integer provided by the input, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input, `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[m-1]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[m-1]` and `a[m]` if `a[m-1]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[m]`, `extra` is an empty set if `a[m-1]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains `a[m-1]`, `j` is `m`, `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.**
