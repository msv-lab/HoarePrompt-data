Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ `n`. The array `a` contains `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the integers read from the input.
- `a` remains the sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `i` will be `k - 1` after the loop completes.
- `ans1` will be the final value after all `k` iterations of the loop.
- `ans2` will be the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x + k - 1`; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first x elements of a)` plus the sum of `a[i]` for `i` from `x` to `x + k - 1`, minus `2 * a[i + x]` for each `i` where `i + x < n`; `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged; `a` remains the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `k - 1`; `ans1` is the sum of the initial `ans1` plus the sum of `a[i]` for `i` from `0` to `k-1` minus twice the sum of `a[i + x]` for `i` from `0` to `k-1` where `i + x < n`; `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
