The code snippet provided is:
```
v2 = i
```
This line of code assigns the current value of `i` to `v2`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the value of `i` is `i + 1` from a previous operation, but since we are not given the specific value of `i` before this operation, we can only state that `v2` will be `i + 1` after this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`, otherwise `v1` remains 0, `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `v2` is `i + 1`, `r` is the input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.
