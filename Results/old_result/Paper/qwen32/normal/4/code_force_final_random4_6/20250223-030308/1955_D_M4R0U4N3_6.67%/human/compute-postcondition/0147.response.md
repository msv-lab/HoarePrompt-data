The code snippet provided updates the `todo` set by reading a new set of integers from the input. This does not affect the values of the other variables directly. Therefore, the only change is that `todo` is now set to the new set of integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input; `done` is a set of integers that have been in the sliding window and have been moved from `todo` to `done` at least once; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the sliding window that were not in `todo` initially and have not been moved to `done` or `todo` during the loop; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.**
