The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given the initial state, if `c` equals `r`, `num` was initially 2, and if `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was initially 4. 

- If `c` equals `r`, `num` was 2, and after the increment, `num` becomes 4.
- If `c` does not equal `r`, `num` was 4, and after the increment, `num` becomes 6.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `c` and `r` are the new integers obtained from the input, If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 4 and `m` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `num` is 6 and `m` is `n - 2`. `i` is 4.**
