Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input. If `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is set to `a * n` and `ans2` is set to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is equal to 1, no additional variables `ans1` and `ans2` are calculated.**
