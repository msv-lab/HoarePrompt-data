Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes the value `abs(a[0] - b[0])`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `temp` or the loop continues.**
