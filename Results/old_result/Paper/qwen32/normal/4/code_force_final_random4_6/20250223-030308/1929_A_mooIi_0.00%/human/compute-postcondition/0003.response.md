Let's break down the given information and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. This variable `t` represents the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly affect the given code snippet.
- `n` is an input integer. This variable represents the number of elements in the list.
- `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string representations of integers from the input. This means that `ar` is a map object that will contain string representations of integers, and these strings are sorted lexicographically.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Map Object `ar`**: The map object `ar` contains the string representations of integers from the input, sorted lexicographically. For example, if the input integers are `[3, 10, 2]`, their string representations are `['3', '10', '2']`, and sorting them lexicographically results in `['10', '2', '3']`.

2. **Joining the Map Object**: The `join` method concatenates the elements of the map object `ar` into a single string, with each element separated by a space. So, if `ar` contains `['10', '2', '3']`, the result of `' '.join(ar)` will be the string `'10 2 3'`.

### Output:
Since the exact integers in the input are not specified, we can't provide the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **' '.join(ar) (where ar is a map object containing the lexicographically sorted string representations of the input integers)**

To make it more precise and understandable:
- The map object `ar` contains the string representations of the integers from the input.
- These string representations are sorted lexicographically.
- The `join` method concatenates these sorted strings with spaces in between.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **a string of lexicographically sorted string representations of the input integers, separated by spaces**
