The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means that the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input, while the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `a` or `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either at least `n` or less than `n`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `t` remains the same, while `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values provided in the input. The conditions related to `a` and `b` remain as described in the initial state.
