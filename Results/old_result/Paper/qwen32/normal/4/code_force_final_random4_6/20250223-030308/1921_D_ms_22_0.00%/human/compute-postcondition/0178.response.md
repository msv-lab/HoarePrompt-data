The code snippet pushes a tuple into the `max_heap` using the `heapq.heappush` function. The tuple consists of `-diff1`, `i`, and `0`. Given that `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `-diff1` will be a negative value with a larger absolute value compared to `-diff2`. This means that in the context of a max-heap implemented using Python's `heapq` (which is a min-heap by default), `-diff1` will be treated as a higher priority.

The variables `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `max_heap` is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of integers read from the input and is now sorted, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**
