The code snippet modifies the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`. According to the initial state, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is initially `left + 1 + i`. After the execution of the code, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is updated to `small_element + i`. Since `small_element` is defined as `left + 1`, the new value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, which is the same as its initial value. Therefore, the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` remains unchanged.

The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, `i`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`, `cliquess[left + i]`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `i` is 1, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**
