Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. Each integer `p_i` in the list `p` is distinct, satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` is not equal to `i`, and `t` is between 1 and 5000. The function returns a value for each test case based on these inputs.**
