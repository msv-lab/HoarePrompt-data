The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables. It only exits the nearest enclosing loop or `switch` statement. Since there is no loop or `switch` statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement does not change any of the variables' values or the program's state.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is 0; `s`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are as described in the initial state.**
