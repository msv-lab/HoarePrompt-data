To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the `pattern` list is being constructed.

The loop runs for `n // 2` iterations. In each iteration, it appends two characters to the `pattern` list: the first character alternates between 'A' and 'B', and the second character is the opposite of the first character. This means that the loop appends 'A' followed by 'B', then 'B' followed by 'A', and so on.

Given the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can see the pattern forming:
- After 1 iteration: `pattern` is ['A', 'B']
- After 2 iterations: `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A']
- After 3 iterations: `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B']

The loop will continue to add pairs of characters ('A', 'B') or ('B', 'A') until it has run `n // 2` times. Therefore, the final `pattern` list will have `2 * (n // 2)` elements.

Since `t` is not directly involved in the loop's execution and its value is only constrained by the precondition (0 <= t-1 <= 49, which simplifies to 1 <= t <= 50), its value remains unchanged.

The final output state is:
- `t` remains the same as the initial input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `n` remains the same as the initial input integer.
- `pattern` will be a list with `2 * (n // 2)` elements, alternating between 'A' and 'B'.

In natural language, the final output state is that `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and `pattern` is a list with `n // 2` pairs of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters.

Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, n is the new input integer, pattern is a list with 2 * (n // 2) elements where the elements alternate between 'A' and 'B'.**
