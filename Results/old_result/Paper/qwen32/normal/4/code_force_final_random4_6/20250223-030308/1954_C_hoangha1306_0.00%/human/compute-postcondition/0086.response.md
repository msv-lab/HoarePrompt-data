Postcondition: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, and the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal. If `vt` was 0, then `vt` is now 1, and `kq1` is the string representation of `x` while `kq2` is the string representation of `y` if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `b[i]`; otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**
