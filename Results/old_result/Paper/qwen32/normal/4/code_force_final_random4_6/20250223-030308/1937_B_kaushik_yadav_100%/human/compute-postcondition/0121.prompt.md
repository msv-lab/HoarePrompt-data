Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is equal to 0; `work` is True; `j` is `len(a) - 1`; `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[i]` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `b`; `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `i` is equal to 1; `work` is False; `j` is `len(a) - 1`; `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is constructed based on the conditions: if `work` is True, `ans` is the initial `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, otherwise `ans` is the initial `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` only. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[i]` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `ans` is the first character of `b`, and now `ans` has `b[i]` appended to it; `i` is `len(a) - 2` if `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `i` is 1 if `i + 1` does not equal `len(a)` and `len(a)` is greater than 1, or `i` is 2 if `i + 1` equals `len(a)` and `len(a)` is greater than 1, or `i` is `len(a) - 1` if `work` is False and `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `i` is 2 if `work` is False; `work` is False; `j` is `len(a) - 1`; `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the conditions and includes either the second-to-last character of `a` or `b[i]`. If `work` is True, then `ans` includes the second-to-last character of `a`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `i` remains `len(a) - 2`, `work` is False, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, and `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop. If `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` also includes the character at index `i` of `b`, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] >= a[i + 1]`, `i` is set to `len(a) - 1`, `work` is False, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, and `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop. If `work` is False, `ans` includes `b[i]`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `work` is False, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, and `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
