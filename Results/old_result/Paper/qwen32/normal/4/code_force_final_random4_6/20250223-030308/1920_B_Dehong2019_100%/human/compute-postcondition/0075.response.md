The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is `x - 1`, this means `ans1` is increased by the value of the `x-th` element in the sorted list `a` (since list indices start at 0).

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input with `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x - 1`; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]`; `ans2` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `k` must be greater than 0.**
