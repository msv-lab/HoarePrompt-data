The code snippet `gaps.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `gaps`. This means that `gaps` will now contain the value of `gap` as its first element. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, `gaps` is a list containing `[gap]`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `gap` is greater than 0.**
