The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
2. The variable `n` must be greater than 0, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
3. For each test case, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 1,000,000,000, and both are odd.
4. The `print` statement outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables, the output will always be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
