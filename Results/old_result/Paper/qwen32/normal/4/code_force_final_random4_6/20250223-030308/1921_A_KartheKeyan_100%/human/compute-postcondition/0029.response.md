Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing two tuples `((x1, y1), (x, y))`; `res` is 0; `i` is 1; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**

Natural language: The `coord` list now contains two tuples, the original `(x1, y1)` and the newly appended `(x, y)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
