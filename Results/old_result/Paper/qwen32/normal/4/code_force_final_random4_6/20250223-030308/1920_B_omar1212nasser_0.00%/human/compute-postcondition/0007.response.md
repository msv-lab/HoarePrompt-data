To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head is defined by the `for` statement:

```python
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `removals` is at least 1, because `range(1, removals + 1)` will generate at least one value (1) if `removals` is greater than or equal to 1. If `removals` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted in the loop head is `removals`. The other variables (`negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`, `n`) do not affect the execution of the loop directly, as they are not part of the loop head.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing one element `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`**
