Let's break down the print statement and the preconditions to understand what will be printed:

1. **`'2 %d' % i`**:
   - The string `'2 %d'` is a format string where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - `i` is given as 2 in the initial state.
   - Therefore, `'2 %d' % i` will be replaced with `'2 2'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - `n` is given as 5 in the initial state.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, so `range(1, 5 + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments to the `print` function, so it will print the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 separated by spaces.

Combining these, the `print` statement will output:
- `'2 2'` (from the formatted string)
- Followed by the unpacked range `1 2 3 4 5`

Thus, the complete output will be:
Output: **2 2 1 2 3 4 5**
