The `while` loop condition is `high >= cur`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur`.

Given the information:
- `cur` can be `low` or `low + 1` or `low + 2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and must be greater than `low + 1`.

From the problem, we know:
- `high` must be greater than `low + 1`.
- `cur` can be `low`, `low + 1`, or `low + 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `cur` should be less than `high`. Given that `high` must be greater than `low + 1`, `cur` can be `low` or `low + 1` and the loop will still execute one more time.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `cur` is not yet equal to `high`. Since `cur` can be `low + 2` and we need to ensure the loop can still execute, we need to make sure `cur` is not yet `high`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and must be greater than `low + 1`; `cur` is less than `high`**

This ensures that the loop condition `high >= cur` is satisfied, and the loop can execute one more time.
