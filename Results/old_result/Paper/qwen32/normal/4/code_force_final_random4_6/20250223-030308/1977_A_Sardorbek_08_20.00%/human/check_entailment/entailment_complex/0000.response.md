### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, given that each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes).

2. **Logic:**
   - If `n == m`, the program prints "YES" because Nikita can simply add one cube at a time for `m` moves.
   - If `n < m`, the program prints "NO" because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves available.
   - If `n >= m`, the program checks if `n % 2 == m % 2`. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The last condition `n % 2 == m % 2` is crucial. Here's why:

- **Parity Check:** The parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m` must match for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because:
  - Adding or removing one cube at a time changes the parity of the number of cubes.
  - If `n` is odd, the final number of cubes will have a different parity compared to the initial number of cubes (which is 0, an even number).
  - If `n` is even, the final number of cubes will have the same parity as the initial number of cubes.

Thus, the condition `n % 2 == m % 2` ensures that the parity of the final number of cubes matches the parity of the number of moves.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
