The code snippet reads an input string and assigns it to the variable `b` after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, or `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace.**
