Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1.
3. `g` is initialized to 0.
4. `v1` is initialized to 0.
5. `v2` is initialized to `i`.

### Key Points:
- The value of `t` and `n` are not directly used in the print statement.
- `g` is not used in the print statement.
- `v1` is explicitly set to 0.
- `v2` is set to `i`, but `i` is not defined in the initial state. Given the context, it's reasonable to assume that `i` is a variable that has been previously set to some value, but since it's not provided, we will treat it as an unknown value `i`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is explicitly 0.
- `v2` is `i`, which is an unknown value based on the given information.

### Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `v1` and `v2`.

Output: **? 0 0 [i] [i] (where i is the value of v2)**

This output reflects that `v1` is 0 and `v2` is `i`, which is an unknown value `i` based on the information provided.
