Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a`, a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n`. The function returns 'Yes' if a certain condition is met; otherwise, it returns 'No' in four different cases. However, based on the provided output, the function always returns 'No' in the first four cases and 'Yes' in the fifth case.**
