Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` must be at least 4; `x` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `x` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial conditions and constraints.
