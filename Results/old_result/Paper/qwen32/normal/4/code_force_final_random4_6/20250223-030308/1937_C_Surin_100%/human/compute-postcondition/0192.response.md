Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i+1`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is `i`, `r2` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, the output buffer is flushed.**

In natural language: The value of `prev` is now set to the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
