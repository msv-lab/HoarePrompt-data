Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` and `y` are such that `y >= x` and `y` is now `y - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `y` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd still holds, and the relationship between `x` and `y` is now `y >= x` with `y` being one less than its previous value.
