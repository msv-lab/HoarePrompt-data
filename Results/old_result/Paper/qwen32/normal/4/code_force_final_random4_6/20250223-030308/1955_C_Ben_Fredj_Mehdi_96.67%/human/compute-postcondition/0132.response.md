Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `a` is a list of integers.
3. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
4. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
5. `z` is incremented by 1.

### Print Statement
```python
print('1')
```

### Analysis of the Print Statement
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `z`) mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'1'`.

### Output
Since the print statement is not influenced by any of the variables or their values, it will always print `'1'`.

Output: **1**
