Output State: **The `dp` matrix is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. The value at `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the LCS between the entire lists `a` and `b`. `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. `l` is a list containing the element `a[0]`. The value at `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value at `dp[i][j - 1]`, and the value at `dp[i][j]` is not equal to the value at `dp[i - 1][j]`.**

In simpler terms: The `dp` matrix remains the same. The list `l` now contains the first element of list `a`. The values of `i` and `j` remain 0. The conditions regarding the values in the `dp` matrix at positions `[i][j]`, `[i][j - 1]`, and `[i - 1][j]` still hold.
