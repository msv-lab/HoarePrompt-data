The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('2')`. This statement explicitly prints the string `'2'`. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are provided in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is printing a hardcoded string.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('2')`.
2. The string `'2'` is a literal and does not depend on the values of any variables.
3. The initial state provides details about the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but these are not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
