The provided code snippet `a = int(input())` changes the variable `a` by assigning it the integer value of the input received. The initial state specifies that `a` is a binary string of length `n`. After the execution of the code, `a` is no longer a binary string but an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer; `b` is a binary string of length `m`; the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
