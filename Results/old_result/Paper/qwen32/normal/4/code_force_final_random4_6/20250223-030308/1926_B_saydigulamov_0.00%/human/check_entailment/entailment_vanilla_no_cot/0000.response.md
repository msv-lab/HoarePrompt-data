Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Counting '1's in each row**: The program counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. However, it does not store the positions of the '1's, which is crucial for determining whether they form a square or a triangle.

2. **Checking for square or triangle**: The program only checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. It does not check the pattern of '1's in subsequent rows.

3. **Output**: The program prints the list of counts of '1's in rows that contain '1's, which is not the expected output. It should print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the shape.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify the rows that contain '1's.
- Check if the counts of '1's in these rows form a consistent pattern for either a square or a triangle.
- Ensure that the '1's are centered for a triangle or aligned at the same distance from the left edge for a square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for row in grid:
        count = row.count('1')
        if count == 0:
            continue
        first_one = row.index('1')
        if count != n or row.count('0', first_one + count) != 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    k = 0
    for row in grid:
        count = row.count('1')
        if count == 0:
            continue
        if k == 0:
            k = count
        elif count != k:
            return False
        first_one = row.index('1')
        if count != 2 * (first_one + 1) - 1 or row.count('0', first_one + count) != 0:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        if is_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        elif is_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")  # This line should not be reached given the problem constraints

func()
```

This program correctly identifies whether the shape in the grid is a square or a triangle based on the described patterns.
