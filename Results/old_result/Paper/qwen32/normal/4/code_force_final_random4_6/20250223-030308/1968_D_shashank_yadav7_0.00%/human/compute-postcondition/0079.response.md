To determine the new value of `bm` after the given operation, we need to evaluate the expression `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.

Given:
- `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`
- `bp` is `2 * a[b]`
- `k` is `-1`
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`

The expression inside the `max` function becomes:
- `a[b] * k + bp` = `a[b] * -1 + 2 * a[b]` = `-a[b] + 2 * a[b]` = `a[b]`

Thus, `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` simplifies to `max(bm, a[b])`.

Since `bm` is already `max(0, a[b])`, the expression `max(bm, a[b])` will simply be `bm` if `bm` is greater than or equal to `a[b]`, or `a[b]` if `a[b]` is greater than `bm`. However, `bm` is already the maximum of `0` and `a[b]`, so `bm` will remain `bm` if `a[b]` is less than or equal to `bm`.

Therefore, the updated value of `bm` will be:
- `bm` if `a[b] <= bm`
- `a[b]` if `a[b] > bm`

Since `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, it will not change if `a[b] <= bm`. If `a[b] > bm`, `bm` will be updated to `a[b]`.

Given that `bm` is initially `max(0, a[b])`, the value of `bm` will not change after the operation.

Thus, the Output State remains:
Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `max(0, a[s])`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`.**
