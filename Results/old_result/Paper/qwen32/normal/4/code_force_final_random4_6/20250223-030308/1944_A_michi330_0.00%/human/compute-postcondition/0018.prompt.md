Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, t, 1):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k >= n - 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(n - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value, and `i` must be less than `t`; `n` and `k` are the two integers provided as input. The value of `k` is compared to `n - 1`, but the values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged regardless of the comparison result.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input. The condition `k >= n - 1` determines whether the if block or the else block is executed, but both blocks result in the same state of variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
