The only variables in the loop head are `itest` and `t`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for itest in range(0, t, 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `itest` is 0, and `t` is at least 1. Since the loop increments `itest` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `itest` should be incremented by 1.

The loop will continue to execute as long as `itest` is less than `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `itest` should be 1 (since it was 0 at the end of the previous iteration), and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`itest` is 1, `t` is at least 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. Either `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`.**
