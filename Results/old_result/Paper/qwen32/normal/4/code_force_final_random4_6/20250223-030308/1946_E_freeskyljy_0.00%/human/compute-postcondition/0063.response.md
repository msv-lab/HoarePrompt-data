To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve over time.

### Key Points:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs while `i < N`. Initially, `i` is set to `N + 1`, which means the loop does not execute at all because the condition `i < N` is not satisfied.
2. **Loop Body**:
   - If `i == R[cur]`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * nums_left % MOD`, and `nums_left` is decremented by 1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned values from the input.
- `L` and `R` are lists read from the input.
- `nums_left` is initialized to -1.
- `M2` is greater than 1.
- `cur` is initialized to 1.
- `i` is initialized to `N + 1`.

### Observations:
- Since `i` starts at `N + 1`, the loop condition `i < N` is never satisfied, and the loop does not execute even once.
- Therefore, the values of `nums_left`, `cur`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

### Final Output State:
- `nums_left` remains `-1`.
- `cur` remains `1`.
- `i` remains `N + 1`.
- `ans` remains unchanged (since the loop did not execute).

### Conclusion:
The loop does not execute because the initial value of `i` is `N + 1`, which is greater than `N`. Therefore, the state of the variables remains exactly as it was at the start.

Output State: **nums_left is -1; cur is 1; i is N + 1; ans is unchanged.**

In natural language: The loop does not execute because the starting value of `i` is `N + 1`, which is greater than `N`. Therefore, the values of `nums_left`, `cur`, and `i` remain `-1`, `1`, and `N + 1`, respectively, and `ans` remains unchanged.
