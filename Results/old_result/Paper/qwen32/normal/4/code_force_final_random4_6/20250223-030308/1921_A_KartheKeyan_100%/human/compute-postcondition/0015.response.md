The code snippet sorts the list `coord` which contains four tuples. Sorting will order the tuples based on the default tuple comparison, which compares the first element of each tuple, and if they are equal, compares the second element, and so on.

Given that `coord` initially contains four tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))`, after sorting, the order of these tuples will change based on their values. The specific order depends on the values of `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4`.

Since the exact values of these coordinates are not provided, we can't determine the specific new order of the tuples. However, we know that `coord` will be a sorted list of the original four tuples.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a sorted list of the original four tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3.**
