Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of different final configurations for the given problem. The logic for calculating the number of possible configurations is flawed, particularly in how it handles the dynamic programming (DP) array and the transitions between states.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **DP Transition Formula**: The DP transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is incorrect. The correct formula should account for the fact that for each new rook placement, you can either place it on a diagonal (which doesn't allow the computer to mirror it) or off the diagonal (which does allow the computer to mirror it). The transition should correctly reflect the combinatorial choices available.

2. **Base Cases**: The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are not necessarily correct for all scenarios. The value of `dp[2]` should reflect the number of ways to place two rooks on a 2x2 board, considering the mirroring rule.

3. **Handling of m**: The variable `m` represents the number of remaining positions that can be filled with rooks. The program correctly calculates `m`, but the DP array and transitions need to be adjusted to correctly handle the placement of rooks.

4. **Output for m == 0 and m == 1**: The program correctly outputs `1` for `m == 0` and `m == 1`, but this should be derived from the correct DP logic rather than hardcoded.

To fix the program, the DP logic needs to be reconsidered and implemented correctly to count the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions on the board. The correct approach involves understanding the combinatorial choices and constraints imposed by the mirroring rule.
