Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a pair of friends who are best friends with each other (i.e., `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it correctly concludes that only 2 invitations are needed since both friends in the pair will attend the party. However, the program incorrectly assumes that if no such pair is found, then 3 invitations are always needed. This is not necessarily true.

Consider the following counterexample:
- For `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the program will output `3` because it does not find any `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`. However, Monocarp can send invitations to friends `1` and `2`, and both `1` and `2` will attend because `1` and `2` are best friends with `2` and `3` respectively, and `2` and `3` are best friends with `3` and `4` respectively, and `4` and `1` are best friends with `1` and `2` respectively. Thus, only 2 invitations are needed.

The program does not consider other possible pairs or configurations that could allow fewer than 3 invitations to be sent while still having at least 2 friends attend the party. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this reason.

Correctness: **False**
