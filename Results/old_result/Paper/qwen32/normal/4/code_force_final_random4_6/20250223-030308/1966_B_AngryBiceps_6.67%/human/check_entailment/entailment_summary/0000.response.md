### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the described operations. The program checks if the first row is uniform and different from the last row or if the first column is uniform and different from the last column. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', otherwise 'YES'.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. **First Row and Last Row Check**:
   - If the first row (`a[0]`) is uniform (i.e., all characters are the same) and different from the last row (`a[-1]`), it implies that there's no way to change the color of the first row to match the last row or vice versa using the described operations, because the operation can only change the color of a subrectangle between two squares of the same color.
   
2. **First Column and Last Column Check**:
   - Similarly, if the first column (`first_row`) is uniform and different from the last column (`last_row`), it implies the same issue as above.

If neither of these conditions is met, it means there is a way to potentially make all squares the same color through a series of operations.

### Correctness:
The given program correctly implements the logic described above. It checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. If the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or the first column is uniform and different from the last column, it correctly prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
