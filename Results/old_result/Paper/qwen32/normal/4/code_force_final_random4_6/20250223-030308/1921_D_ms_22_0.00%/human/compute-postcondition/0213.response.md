Postcondition: **`max_heap` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` with one tuple removed, `ans` is `ans + diff`, `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. `item` is a tuple `(-diff, i, index)` where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is an element from list `a`, and `index` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which difference was maximum. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, then `tp1` is set to `1` and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` remains `0` and `tp2` is set to `m - 2`.**
