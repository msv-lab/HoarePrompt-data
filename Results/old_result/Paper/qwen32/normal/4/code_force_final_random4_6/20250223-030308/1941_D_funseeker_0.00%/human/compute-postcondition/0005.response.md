The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `temp` as an empty set. This operation does not affect the existing variables `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, or `c`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.**
