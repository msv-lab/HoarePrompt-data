Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups needed to satisfy the given condition. The logic in `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the program is attempting to use bitwise operations in a way that does not correctly account for the requirement that no two numbers in the same group can have matching bits in the 1st to 31st positions.

The correct approach involves recognizing that each unique pattern of bits from 1st to 31st positions in the binary representation of the numbers dictates the need for a separate group. Essentially, the problem is about counting the unique 31-bit patterns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    unique_patterns = set()
    for num in a:
        # Mask to consider only the first 31 bits
        pattern = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        unique_patterns.add(pattern)
    return len(unique_patterns)
```

In this corrected version, `unique_patterns` is a set that stores the unique 31-bit patterns found in the input numbers. The length of this set is the minimum number of groups needed.
