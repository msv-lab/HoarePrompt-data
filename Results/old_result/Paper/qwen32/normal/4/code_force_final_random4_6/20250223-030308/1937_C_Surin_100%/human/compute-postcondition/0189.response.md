Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

- `t` is unchanged (we don't know its value, but it's not used in the print statement).
- `n` is greater than `i+1` (we don't know the exact values of `n` and `i`, but we know the relationship between them).
- `kp` is incremented by 1 (we don't know its initial value, but it's not used in the print statement).
- `g` is 0 (we don't use this in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant here).
- `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received).
- `v2` is `n-1` (we don't use this in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant here).
- `r` is an input string. Depending on the value of `r`, the following actions are taken:
  - If `r` equals `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`.
  - If `r` does not equal `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains 0.
  - If `r` equals `'='`, `r2` is the new input string, and `i` is `i+1`.

### Print Statement Analysis

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received).
- `i` is the current value of `i` (which might have been incremented if `r` was `'='`).
- `prev` is set based on the value of `r`:
  - `prev` is set to `i` if `r` is `'<'` or `'>'`.
  - `prev` remains `0` if `r` is not `'<'` or `'>'`.

### Output Determination

The output will be in the format `? v1 i v1 prev`, where:
- `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received).
- `i` is the current value of `i`.
- `prev` is `i` if `r` is `'<'` or `'>'`, otherwise `prev` is `0`.

### Final Answer

Without specific values for `v1`, `i`, and `r`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is the last value of i for which the input was '<' or 0 if no '<' was received, i is the current value of i, and prev is i if r is '<' or '>', otherwise prev is 0)**
