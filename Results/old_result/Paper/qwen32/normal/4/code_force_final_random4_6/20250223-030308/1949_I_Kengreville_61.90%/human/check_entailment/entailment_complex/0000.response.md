### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine if we can adjust the radii of disks such that they remain tangent to each other, do not overlap, and the sum of the radii strictly decreases.

The provided code uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. The key idea is to determine if there exists a way to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii decreases. The DFS function explores all disks that are tangent to a given disk and updates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) that are used to determine if a valid adjustment is possible.

The main function (`func_1`) initializes the necessary data structures, reads the input, and then iterates over each disk. If a disk has not been visited, it starts a DFS from that disk, updating the `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists. After the DFS, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the disks in the current connected component is non-zero. If so, it sets `ok` to `True`, indicating that a valid adjustment is possible.

The DFS function (`dfs`) checks each disk to see if it is tangent to the current disk (`i`). If it is, it updates the coefficients and recursively visits the tangent disk.

The correctness of the program depends on whether the DFS correctly identifies connected components and whether the coefficient updates correctly reflect the conditions needed to adjust the radii. The provided code seems to follow the correct approach, but let's analyze the specific logic:

1. **DFS Correctness**: The DFS function correctly identifies tangent disks and updates the coefficients. The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` ensures that disks `i` and `j` are tangent.
2. **Coefficient Updates**: The updates to `coef0` and `coef1` are designed to ensure that the sum of the radii can be adjusted while maintaining tangency and non-overlap. The condition `c1 != 0` in the main function ensures that there is a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases.
3. **Output**: Based on the value of `ok`, the program correctly outputs "YES" or "NO".

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the logic appears to be correct. The DFS ensures that all tangent disks are considered, and the coefficient updates are designed to reflect the necessary conditions for adjusting the radii.
