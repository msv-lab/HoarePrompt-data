The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state of `n`, `a`, and `b` is not specified, but after the execution of the code, these variables will hold the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `_` is 1.**

In plain terms: The value of `t` remains unchanged as an input integer representing the number of test cases, which is greater than or equal to 2. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are now assigned the values read from the input. The variable `_` remains 1.
