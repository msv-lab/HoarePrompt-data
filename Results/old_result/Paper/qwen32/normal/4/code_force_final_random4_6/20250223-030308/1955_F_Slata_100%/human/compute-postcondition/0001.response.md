The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into four parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input.**
