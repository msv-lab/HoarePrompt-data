The `print('NO')` statement in the given code snippet will print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `n` and `k`. The initial state provides information about the constraints and relationship between `n` and `k`, but these do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement is explicitly printing the string 'NO'.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`, and the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.
2. **Code Execution**: The `print('NO')` statement is executed.
3. **Output**: The string 'NO' is printed.

Since the print statement is hardcoded to print 'NO', the values of `n` and `k` do not influence the output.

Output: **NO**
