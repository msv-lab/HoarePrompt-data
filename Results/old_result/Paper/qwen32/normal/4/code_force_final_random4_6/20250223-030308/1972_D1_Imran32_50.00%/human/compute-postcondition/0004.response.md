The code snippet `cnt = i * i` assigns the value of `i` squared to `cnt`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific value of `cnt` without knowing `i`. The values of `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `root` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^6), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6), `ans` is `n`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, `cnt` is `i * i`**
