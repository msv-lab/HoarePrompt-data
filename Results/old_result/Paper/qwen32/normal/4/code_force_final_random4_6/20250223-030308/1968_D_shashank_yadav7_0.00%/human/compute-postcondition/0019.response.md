Output State: **`t` is the integer value obtained from the input, which must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, and `sm` remain as described in the initial state; if `k` is 0, `bm` is `max(bm, bp)`; if `k` is not 0, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains the same as it was initially, being the integer input greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `k` remains 0 if it was initially 0.
- `s` remains `p[s] - 1`.
- `b` remains `p[b] - 1`.
- The arrays `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, and `sm` remain unchanged except for `sm`.
- If `k` was 0, `bm` remains `max(bm, bp)`.
- If `k` was not 0, `bm` remains `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
