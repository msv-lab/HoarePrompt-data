Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it assumes there are always 10 test cases, regardless of the input value `t`. The problem description clearly states that the number of test cases `t` can be between 1 and 100 inclusive. Therefore, the program should read `t` and iterate `t` times instead of always iterating 10 times.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  3 5
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program would wait for 9 more inputs and then output:
  ```
  5 3
  ```

To fix the program, the loop should iterate `t` times instead of always 10 times. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```
