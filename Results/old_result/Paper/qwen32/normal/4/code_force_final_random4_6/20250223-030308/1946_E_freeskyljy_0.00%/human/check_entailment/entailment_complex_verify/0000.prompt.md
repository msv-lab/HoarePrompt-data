You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases and potential scenarios correctly. Let's examine a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2 2
1 3
2 4
```
According to the problem description, we need to find the number of permutations of length 4 where the prefix maximums are at indices 1 and 3, and the suffix maximums are at indices 2 and 4.

- The prefix maximum at index 1 means the first element is the maximum up to that point.
- The prefix maximum at index 3 means the third element is the maximum up to that point.
- The suffix maximum at index 2 means the second element is the maximum from that point to the end.
- The suffix maximum at index 4 means the fourth element is the maximum from that point to the end.

The only permutation that satisfies these conditions is `[3, 4, 2, 1]`. Therefore, the correct output should be `1`.

However, the provided program would return `0` for this input. Here's why:

In the provided program, the condition `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]):` is used to check for certain conditions. For the test case above, `L[-2]` is `1` and `R[1]` is `2`, so this condition is not met. However, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where there are multiple prefix and suffix maximums.

The main issue lies in the logic that calculates the number of valid permutations. The program uses combinations and multiplication to calculate the number of valid permutations, but it does not correctly account for all possible valid permutations, especially when there are multiple prefix and suffix maximums.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases and potential scenarios correctly.
