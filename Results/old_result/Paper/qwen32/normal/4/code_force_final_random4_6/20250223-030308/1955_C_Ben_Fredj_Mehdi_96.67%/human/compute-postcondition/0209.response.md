To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **a**: A list of integers obtained from an input line, split by spaces.
3. **z**: Incremented by 1 (though it is not used in the given print statement, it's part of the initial state).
4. **n**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
5. **k**: The integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement directly prints the string `'1'`. None of the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, or `k` are used in this specific print statement. Therefore, the output is independent of the values of these variables.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
