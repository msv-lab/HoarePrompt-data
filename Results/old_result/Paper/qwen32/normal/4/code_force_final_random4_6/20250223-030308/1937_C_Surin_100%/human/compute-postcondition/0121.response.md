The value of `prev` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged. `i` is already incremented by 1 in the initial state, so no further change is necessary for `i` itself in this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, `i` is incremented by 1, `prev` is equal to `i`**.
