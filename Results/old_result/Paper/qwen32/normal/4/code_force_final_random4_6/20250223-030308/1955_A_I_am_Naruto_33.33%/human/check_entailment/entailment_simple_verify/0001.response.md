### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and example test cases.

#### Problem Analysis
Maxim needs to buy `n` yogurts with the following options:
1. Buy one yogurt for `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts for `b` burles.

The goal is to find the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

#### Program Analysis
The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` and calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: Cost if all yogurts are bought individually, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2`: Cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible:
       - `b * (n // 2)`: Cost for the full pairs of yogurts.
       - `a * (n % 2)`: Cost for any remaining yogurt that cannot form a pair.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n == 1`, the program simply prints `a` because buying one yogurt individually is the only option.

#### Correctness Check
- **Case 1: `n > 1`**
  - The program correctly computes the cost of buying all yogurts individually (`ans1`).
  - It also correctly computes the cost of buying yogurts in pairs (`ans2`), accounting for any remaining yogurt.
  - The program then selects the minimum of these two costs, which is the optimal solution.

- **Case 2: `n == 1`**
  - The program correctly handles the case where only one yogurt is needed by simply buying it individually at price `a`.

#### Example Validation
Let's validate the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9`
  - Minimum cost is `9`.

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 18 + 5 = 23`
  - Minimum cost is `15`.

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 22 + 5 = 27`
  - Minimum cost is `15`.

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 22`
  - Minimum cost is `20`.

The program produces the correct output for all test cases.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
