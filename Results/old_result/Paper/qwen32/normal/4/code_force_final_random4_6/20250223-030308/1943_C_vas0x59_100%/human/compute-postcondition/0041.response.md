The code snippet appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Given the initial state, `path_ba` initially contains `[b, n, n]`. After the code executes, `path_ba` will contain `[b, n, n, n]`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the tree, as returned by the `bfs` function; `a` is assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree from vertex `a`, as returned by the `bfs` function; `b` is assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, n, n, n]`; `n` is `previous[n]`. If `n` is equal to -1, the program does not modify `path_ba` further.**
