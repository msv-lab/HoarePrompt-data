Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `a[i] * 4`, `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`, `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i] * 2`, making it the sum of all elements in `a` minus `a[i] * 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
