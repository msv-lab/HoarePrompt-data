To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input string representing the number of test cases. However, this variable is not used in the print statement.
- `x` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[0]` from ten different inputs.
- `y` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[1]` from ten different inputs.
- `i` is set to 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

Given that `i` is 2, the print statement will output the element at index 2 of the `y` list followed by a space and the element at index 2 of the `x` list.

Since the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values to be printed. However, we know the exact positions in the lists that will be accessed.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **y[2]  x[2] (where y[2] is the third element of the y list and x[2] is the third element of the x list)**
