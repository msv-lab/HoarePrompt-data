To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the code.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `1`**:
   - The number `1` is explicitly printed as the first element.
   
2. **Value of `i`**:
   - The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, it is not possible to determine its value based on the given information. We'll assume `i` is a variable that has been defined elsewhere in the code, and we'll represent its value as `[i]`.

3. **`range(n, 0, -1)`**:
   - This generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.
   - For example, if `n` is `5`, the sequence generated by `range(5, 0, -1)` will be `5, 4, 3, 2, 1`.

### Putting it all together:
- The `print` function will output `1`, followed by the value of `i`, and then the sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)`.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we'll represent it as `[i]`. The sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)` will be a decreasing sequence starting from `n` down to `1`.

Output: **1, [i], n, n-1, ..., 2, 1 (where [i] is the value of i and n is at least 1)**
