To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations.

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2` (since the range is `range(1, n - 1)`). The loop checks if the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1. If it is, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it toggles the value of `ans` (i.e., `ans ^= 1`).

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
1. After 1 iteration (`i = 1`), `ans` is toggled if `s[1] - s[0] <= 1`.
2. After 2 iterations (`i = 2`), `ans` is toggled if `s[2] - s[1] <= 1`.
3. After 3 iterations (`i = 3`), `ans` is toggled if `s[3] - s[2] <= 1`.

The loop will continue until either:
- It encounters a pair `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` where `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, and it breaks.
- It completes all iterations from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2`.

### Analysis:
- **If the loop breaks during the iterations**: The final value of `ans` is determined by the number of times the difference was `<= 1` before the break.
- **If the loop completes all iterations**: The final value of `ans` is determined by the number of times the difference was `<= 1` from `i = 1` to `i = n - 2`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains 1.
- `n` remains the length of `arr` and is greater than 2.
- `arr` remains the new list of integers from the input.
- `s` remains a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it.
- `i` will be `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the value of `i` where the loop breaks.
- `ans` will be 1 if the number of times the difference was `<= 1` is even; otherwise, it will be 0.

### Conclusion:
The final output state depends on whether the loop breaks or completes all iterations. However, in either case, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `i` and `ans` will be determined by the loop's execution.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr`, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the value of `i` where the loop breaks, and `ans` is 1 if the number of times the difference was `<= 1` is even; otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
