Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is greater than 0 or `num_tests` is 0 if it was initially 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is incremented by 1, `start_year` is ((`start_year` + 1) // `nums[x]` + 1) * `nums[x]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` is incremented by 1, and `start_year` is recalculated based on the new value of `x` using the formula provided. All other variables remain unchanged.
