The loop head in the provided `for` loop is `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means that the only variable that can be adjusted for the next iteration is `i`. The value of `i` is determined by the range function, which is controlled by the input provided to the `range` function.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input.

The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we assume it was `i` (some integer value). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

However, since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` is incremented by 1 from whatever its value was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

To make this more concrete, if we assume `i` was `0` at the start of the first iteration, then at the start of the second iteration, `i` would be `1`. But without the exact previous value of `i`, the most accurate statement is that `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

If we need to provide a specific example, let's assume `i` was `0` at the start of the first iteration, then the state at the start of the second iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is 1**.

But the general answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
