Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version to determine the correctness of the program. 

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers.
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.

### Key Observations:
- Bob wins if the count of numbers with odd parity (1, 3) is even and the count of numbers with even parity (2, 4) is irrelevant for the XOR being zero.
- If there are three odd counts among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (ignoring \(d\) because it's even), Bob can win one additional time.

### Program Analysis:
The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win using the formula:
\[ \text{Bob wins} = \left(\frac{a}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{c}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{d}{2}\right) + \left(\text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)\right) \]

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Divide each count by 2**: This part ensures that if there are an even number of ones, threes, twos, and fours, then they can be paired up, and Bob can win in those pairs.
2. **Check for three odd counts**: If there are three odd counts among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), then Bob can win one additional time by leaving the remaining odd number (which will be 1 or 3) and making the XOR zero.

### Verification with Examples:
1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{0}{2} + \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{0}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{2} + \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 0 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: \( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{0}{2} + \text{int}(2 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3 \)
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: \( \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{0}{2} + \text{int}(3 \% 2 + 3 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 \)
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

5. **Input**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: \( \frac{0}{2} + \frac{9}{2} + \frac{9}{2} + \frac{9}{2} + \text{int}(0 \% 2 + 9 \% 2 + 9 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 12 \)
   - Output: `12` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given examples and aligns with the logic described in the problem statement. The formula used in the program ensures that Bob wins the maximum number of times by pairing up numbers with even counts and considering the scenario with three odd counts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
