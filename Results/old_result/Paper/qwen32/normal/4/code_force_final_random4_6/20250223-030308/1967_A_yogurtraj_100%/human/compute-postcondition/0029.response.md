Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either 0 or n - 2, `i` is 2, `k` is either 0 or decreased by 2 * (a[2] - a[1]), `r` is a[2] + k // 3`.**

In this output state, the value of `rem` is updated to be the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1` (which is 3 in this case). All other variables retain their initial values or expressions as given in the initial state.
