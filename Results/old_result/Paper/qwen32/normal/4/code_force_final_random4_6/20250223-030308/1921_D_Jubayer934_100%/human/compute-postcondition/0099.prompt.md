Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing Petya's array, and m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) representing the integers Vasya can choose from. The total number of integers m across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    temp = -1
    ans = []
    a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
    for i in range(n):
        if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
            temp = i
            break
        ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
    if temp != -1:
        for i in range(temp, n):
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
    print(sum(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains the first integer from the input, `m` remains the second integer from the input, `temp` is either -1 if the loop completes all iterations without finding an `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, or it is the index `i` where this condition was first met. `ans` contains the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations. `a` remains the sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` remains the first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `temp - 1` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n - 1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, or `-1` if it never becomes true. If `temp` is not `-1`, `n` must be greater than `temp` and `ans` includes the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `temp`, and the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` from `temp` to `n-1`. If `temp` is `-1`, `ans` includes the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
