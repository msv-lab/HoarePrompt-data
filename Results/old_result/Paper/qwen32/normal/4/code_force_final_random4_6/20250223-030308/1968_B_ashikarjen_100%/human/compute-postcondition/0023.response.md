The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The initial state specifies that `j` is 1, so after the execution of the code, `j` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` is at least 2, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `b[1]` is not equal to `a[i]`**.
