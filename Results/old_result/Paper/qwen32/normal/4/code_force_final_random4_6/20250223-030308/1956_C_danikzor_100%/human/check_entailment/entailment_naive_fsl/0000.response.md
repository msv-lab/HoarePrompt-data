Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix as per the problem description. Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to maximize the sum of an n x n matrix using at most 2n operations.
- Operations can be of two types:
  1. Assign a row `i` with a permutation `p` such that `a[i, j] = p[j]`.
  2. Assign a column `i` with a permutation `p` such that `a[j, i] = p[j]`.

### Provided Program:
The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and performs 2n operations by filling each row and each column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the sum is not correct for maximizing the sum of the matrix. The maximum sum should be `n * n * n` because we can fill each cell with the highest possible value in a permutation, which is `n`.
2. **Incorrect Operations**: The operations described in the program do not maximize the sum. By filling each row and column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, the program does not ensure that each cell gets the highest value possible. Instead, it should fill each row and column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to maximize the sum.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum, we should fill each row and column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This way, each cell will be filled with the value `n`, resulting in a maximum sum of `n * n * n`.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * n * n
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
