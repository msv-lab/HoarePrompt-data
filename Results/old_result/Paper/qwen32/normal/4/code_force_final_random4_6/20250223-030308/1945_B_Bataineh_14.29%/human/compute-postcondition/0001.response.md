The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those for the loop to execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 (which is the default starting point for `range(t)`).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is the frequency of launching for the first installation, `b` is the frequency of launching for the second installation, and `m` is the time the firework is visible in the sky**
