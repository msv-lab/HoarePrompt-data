To determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement is executed, let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 49\).
2. `n` is an integer.
3. If `n` is odd, no additional changes are made to the variables.
4. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list with `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `pattern` (if `n` is even). The `print` statement is straightforward and will output `'YES'` regardless of the input values of `t` and `n`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
