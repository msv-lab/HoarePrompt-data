The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to be the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100
- `ii` is 2
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input
- `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`
- `r` is `a[0]`
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0
- It is not the case that ((`i` + 1) * (`a[i + 1]` - `a[i]`) > `k`)

The value of `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and it is not the case that ((`i` + 1) * (`a[i + 1]` - `a[i]`) > `k`).**
