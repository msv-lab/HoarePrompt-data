The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means the previous value of `n` is replaced by the new input integer. The other variables `t`, `a`, and `A` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 4999, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 â‰¤ `a_i` â‰¤ 10^7, `A` is a sorted list of integers.**
