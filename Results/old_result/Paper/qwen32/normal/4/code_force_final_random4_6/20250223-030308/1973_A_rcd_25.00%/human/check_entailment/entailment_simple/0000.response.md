### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, ensuring that the scores are consistent with a valid set of games. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Sum Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is because each game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2 to the winner and 0 to the loser, or 1 to each in case of a draw). If the sum of scores is odd, it is impossible to achieve these scores through a valid set of games, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.

2. **Direct Draw Calculation**:
   - If `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it implies that the highest-scoring player could have drawn all games against the other two players. This is because the maximum points `p3` could have earned by winning all games against `p1` and `p2` would be `p1 + p2` (if `p1` and `p2` lost all their games to `p3`). Hence, the number of draws is `p1 + p2`.

3. **Iterative Draw Calculation**:
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program iteratively tries to find the maximum number of draws. It calculates the range within which the number of draws (`cur`) could lie, defined by `low` and `high`. The program then checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. This condition ensures that the remaining points for `p1` and `p2` after accounting for `cur` draws are consistent with a valid set of games. If such a `cur` is found, the program calculates the total number of draws as `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop. If no such `cur` is found, it defaults to `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when no games are played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`), when there is exactly one game resulting in a draw (`p1 = 0, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`), and when the scores are impossible to achieve (`p1 = 1, p2 = 1, p3 = 1`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify if the scores are inconsistent with a valid set of games. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
