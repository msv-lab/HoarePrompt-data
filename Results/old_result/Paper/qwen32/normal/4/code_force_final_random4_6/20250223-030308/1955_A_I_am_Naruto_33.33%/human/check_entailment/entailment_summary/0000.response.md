### Reasoning:

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case involves determining the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts given the individual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Let's break down the logic used in the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - When `n` (number of yogurts) is greater than 1:
     - It calculates `ans1` as the cost if all yogurts are bought individually, i.e., `a * n`.
     - It calculates `ans2` as the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible using the promotion, i.e., `b * n // 2` (cost for the pairs) plus `a * n % 2` (cost for any remaining yogurt if `n` is odd).
     - It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - When `n` is 1, it directly prints `a` because there's no discount available for a single yogurt.
3. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case on a separate line.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program's logic with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `9` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 5 = 18`
   - Minimum cost: `15` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 5 = 21`
   - Minimum cost: `15` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `20` (Correct)

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is sound and it correctly handles the given problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
