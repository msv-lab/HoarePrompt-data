The code snippet provided is:

```python
prev = i
```

This line of code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `r`, `r2`) are not affected by this line of code. 

The initial state tells us that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration (implied by the context, though not explicitly stated in the given code snippet). Since we don't have the value of `i` before this assignment, we can only state that `prev` will now hold the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `i`. If `r` is `'='`, `prev` is set to `i` if `r2` is `'<'`, otherwise `prev` remains unchanged. If `r` is neither `'>'` nor `'='`, `prev` remains unchanged. `r` is the user's input, `i` is incremented by 1; `r` is the input received from the user, `prev` is now equal to `i`.**
