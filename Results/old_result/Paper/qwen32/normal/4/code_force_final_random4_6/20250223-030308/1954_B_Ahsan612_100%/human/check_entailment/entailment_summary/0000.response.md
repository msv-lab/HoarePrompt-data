### Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given "beautiful" array to make it stop being beautiful. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, it initializes variables `same` to count consecutive identical elements, `num` to track the current number being counted, and `minn` to keep track of the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Iterating through the array**:
   - It iterates through the array, updating `same` when it encounters consecutive identical elements.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and `same`, then resets `same` to count the new sequence starting from the new element.

3. **Final check**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` with the last counted sequence length.
   - If `minn` is either `inf` (which means the array had only one element) or equal to the length of the array (which means all elements were the same), it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`, which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It efficiently calculates the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and uses this to determine the minimum number of deletions required. The edge cases, such as arrays with all identical elements or arrays with only one element, are also correctly handled.
