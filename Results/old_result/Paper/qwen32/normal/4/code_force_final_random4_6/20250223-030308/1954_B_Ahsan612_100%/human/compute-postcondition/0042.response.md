The code snippet `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `ar`. This operation changes the value of `ar` but does not affect the other variables.

Since the code does not provide an input value, we assume that the input is a space-separated list of integers. Let's denote this input list as `[a1, a2, ..., an]`.

Given the initial state, `ar` is reassigned to this new list, and the length of `ar` will be the number of integers in the input list. The variables `i`, `same`, `num`, and `minn` are not directly affected by this assignment unless they are recalculated based on the new `ar` in subsequent code (which is not provided here).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]`; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `num` is the value of the last element in the list `ar` or the value of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, it retains its value. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
