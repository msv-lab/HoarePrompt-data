Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Global Variables in DFS Function**:
   The `dfs` function uses global variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` without explicitly declaring them as global. This can lead to undefined behavior or incorrect results if these variables are not properly initialized or accessed.

2. **DFS Logic**:
   The DFS logic in the `dfs` function is intended to traverse the graph of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the requirement that the sum of all radii strictly decreases. The DFS function calculates `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` but does not ensure that the new radii will result in a strictly decreasing sum of radii.

3. **Condition for Tangency**:
   The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` checks for exact tangency. However, due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic and the problem constraints, it is more appropriate to check if the distance between centers is within a small tolerance of the sum of radii. The current implementation does not account for potential floating-point precision issues.

4. **Handling of Non-Connected Components**:
   The main function `func_1` checks for connected components using DFS but does not handle the logic to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases across all components. The variable `ok` is set to `True` if any component has a non-zero `c1`, but this does not guarantee that the sum of radii will strictly decrease.

5. **Output**:
   The output is based on the variable `ok`, which is set if any component has a non-zero `c1`. However, this condition does not ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases. The problem requires a more comprehensive approach to check if the radii can be adjusted to meet all the conditions.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
4 0 1
```
In this case, the disks are tangent to each other in a line. The current implementation might incorrectly determine that it is possible to adjust the radii to meet the conditions, but in fact, it is not possible to strictly decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Ensuring that the DFS correctly handles the tangency condition with proper precision checks.
- Ensuring that the logic for adjusting radii strictly decreases the sum of radii while maintaining tangency.
- Handling multiple connected components and ensuring the sum of radii decreases across all components.

Given these issues, the current implementation is incorrect.
