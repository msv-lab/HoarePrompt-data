To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop:

```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
    print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration `i`, it prints two lines:
1. `1 i n (n-1) (n-2) ... 2 1`
2. `2 i n (n-1) (n-2) ... 2 1`

The loop will execute `n` times, once for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`.

**Output State after all iterations:**

- The loop will execute exactly `n` times.
- For each iteration `i` from 1 to `n`, two lines will be printed.
- The first line of each iteration will be `1 i n (n-1) (n-2) ... 2 1`.
- The second line of each iteration will be `2 i n (n-1) (n-2) ... 2 1`.

**Output State: **The loop will output `2n` lines in total. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, there will be two lines printed: the first line starting with `1` and the second line starting with `2`, both followed by `i` and the sequence `n, n-1, ..., 2, 1`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the output will consist of `n` pairs of lines. Each pair corresponds to a value of `i` from 1 to `n`, with the first line in the pair starting with `1` and the second line starting with `2`, both followed by `i` and the numbers from `n` down to `1`.
