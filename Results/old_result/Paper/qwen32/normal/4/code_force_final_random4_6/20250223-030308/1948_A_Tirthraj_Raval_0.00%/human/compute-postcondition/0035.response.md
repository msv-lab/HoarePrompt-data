Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 49\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `pattern` is a list with `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(pattern))
```

### Analysis:
- The `pattern` list is constructed such that it alternates between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.
- The length of the `pattern` list is `n`.
- The `''.join(pattern)` expression will concatenate all the elements of the `pattern` list into a single string.

### Example Pattern Construction:
- If `n = 1`, `pattern` will be `['A']`.
- If `n = 2`, `pattern` will be `['A', 'B']`.
- If `n = 3`, `pattern` will be `['A', 'B', 'A']`.
- If `n = 4`, `pattern` will be `['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']`.
- And so on...

### General Pattern:
The pattern can be described as:
- If `n` is even, the pattern will have an equal number of 'A's and 'B's.
- If `n` is odd, the pattern will have one more 'A' than 'B'.

### Output:
The output will be a string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.

### Final Output:
Output: **A string of length n that alternates between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'**.
