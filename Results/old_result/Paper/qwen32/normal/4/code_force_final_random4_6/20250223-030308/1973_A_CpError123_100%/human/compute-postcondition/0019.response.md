The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are being updated based on the new input, while the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are not recalculated in the given code snippet, so they retain their previous values, which are based on the old values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2; `_` is 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the new input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2` (using the old values of `a`, `b`, and `c`); `y` is `a + b` (using the old values of `a` and `b`).**
