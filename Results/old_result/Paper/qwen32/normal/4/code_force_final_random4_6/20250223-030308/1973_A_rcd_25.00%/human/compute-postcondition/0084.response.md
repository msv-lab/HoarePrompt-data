Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 499; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` >= `p1` + `p2`, the program does not specify a change in the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. Otherwise, the output will be `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met during the loop execution; otherwise, it will be `p3`.**
