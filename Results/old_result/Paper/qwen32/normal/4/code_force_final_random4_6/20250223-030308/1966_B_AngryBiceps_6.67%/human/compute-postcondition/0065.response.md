The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `first_row`. 

Given the initial state, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a`. After the execution of the code, `first_row` will be updated to include this new character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a`, `i` is 1**.
