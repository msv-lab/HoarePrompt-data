The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `i`, we can only determine that `pattern` will have one additional element that is either 'A' or 'B'. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 2, `pattern` is a list with one additional element that is either 'A' or 'B'**.
