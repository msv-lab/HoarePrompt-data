### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all the numbers in an \(n \times n\) matrix using Type 1 and Type 2 operations, where each operation involves assigning a permutation to a row or column. The goal is to achieve the maximum sum with no more than \(2n\) operations.

The provided program calculates the maximum sum as the sum of squares of the first \(n\) natural numbers, which is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\). However, the program incorrectly uses the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), which does not represent the sum of squares. The correct formula should be \(\frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\).

Additionally, the operations described in the program are to assign the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1]\) to each row and column. This operation does not maximize the sum of the matrix. To maximize the sum, each cell in the matrix should ideally contain the highest possible value, which would be \(n\) if we could place \(n\) in every cell. However, due to the constraints of the operations, we can achieve the maximum sum by placing the values \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) in each row and column in a way that maximizes the sum.

The correct approach would be to assign the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) to each row and column. This can be done by performing:
1. Type 1 operation for each row \(i\) with permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
2. Type 2 operation for each column \(i\) with permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

This will result in each cell of the matrix having the value \(n\), thus maximizing the sum to \(n^3\).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because:
1. It uses the wrong formula for the maximum sum.
2. It assigns the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 2, 1]\) to each row and column, which does not maximize the sum.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
