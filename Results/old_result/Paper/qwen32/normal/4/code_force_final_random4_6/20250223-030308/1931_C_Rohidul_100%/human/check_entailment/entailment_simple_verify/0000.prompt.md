You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the program and find a case where it fails.

The program's logic is to find the longest prefix and suffix of the array that are the same and then calculate the minimum number of burles needed to make the entire array equal by replacing the middle part. However, this logic does not always yield the correct answer.

Consider the following test case:

```
1
6
1 2 3 2 1 1
```

For this input, the program will calculate the longest prefix and suffix that are the same. In this case, the longest prefix and suffix that are the same are both of length 1 (the first and last elements are 1). Therefore, it will calculate the answer as `6 - max(1, 1) = 5`. However, the correct answer should be 2, as we can make the entire array equal to 1 by selecting `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1`, which costs `5 - 2 + 1 = 4` burles, but we can do better by selecting `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `4 + 1 = 5`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` which costs `4` burles, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` and then `i = 4`, `j = 6`, and `x = 1` which costs `3 + 3 = 6`, but the optimal solution is to select `i = 2`, `j = 5`, and `x = 1` and then `i = 5`, `j =
