The function calculates and returns the maximum value from a list of `removals + 1` elements. This list is generated based on the input list `elements` and the integers `removals` and `negatives`. The first element of the list is derived from the sum of `elements` and the subsequent elements are calculated by iteratively adjusting the sum of `elements` and a subset of its last elements.
