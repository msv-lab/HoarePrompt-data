The value of `kq1` is updated to be the concatenation of its current value and the character at index `i` of the string `a`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged. The variables `q` and `i` are incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[i]`**.
