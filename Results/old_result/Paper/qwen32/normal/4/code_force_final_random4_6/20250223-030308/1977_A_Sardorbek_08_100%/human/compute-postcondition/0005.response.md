The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of these variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. The variable `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
3. The variable `a` is greater than or equal to 1.
4. The variable `b` is the first integer from the input.
5. The variable `c` is the second integer from the input.
6. The variable `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`.
7. The current value of `b` is equal to `c`.

Despite these details about the variables, the `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **YES**
