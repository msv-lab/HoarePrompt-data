Let's carefully analyze the provided solution and the annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an `n x n` matrix using no more than `2n` operations. The operations available are:
1. Type 1: Choose a row `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. Type 2: Choose a column `i` and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

The maximum possible sum for the matrix is `n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`, which is the sum of all numbers from 1 to `n` repeated `n` times.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution calculates the maximum sum for the matrix and performs `2n` operations. Let's break down the solution:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated as `1 + (2^2 - 1^2) * 2 + (3^2 - 2^2) * 3 + ... + (n^2 - (n-1)^2) * n`.
   - Simplifying, this becomes `1 + 3*2 + 5*3 + ... + (2n-1)*n`.
   - This is not the sum of the first `n` squares but rather a specific summation formula that does not match the expected maximum sum of the matrix.

2. **Operations**:
   - The solution performs `2n` operations by applying Type 1 and Type 2 operations on each row and column.
   - However, the specific operations do not guarantee that the matrix will be filled with the largest possible numbers in each row and column.

### Verification

Let's verify the solution step-by-step:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The correct maximum sum for the matrix is `n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - The provided formula `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` does not match this formula.
   - For example, for `n = 2`, the correct sum is `2^2 * (2 + 1) / 2 = 6`. The provided formula calculates `1 + (4 - 1) * 2 = 7`, which is incorrect.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))` and `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))` fill each row and column with the permutation `1, 2, ..., n`.
   - While these operations fill the matrix, they do not ensure that the matrix will have the maximum possible sum.

### Conclusion

The solution incorrectly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix and does not guarantee that the matrix will be filled with the largest possible numbers in each row and column. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The solution incorrectly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and does not guarantee that the matrix will be filled with the largest possible numbers in each row and column.
Final: **False**
