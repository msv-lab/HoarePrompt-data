To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `k` and `j` change with each iteration.

The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration `i`, it searches for the character `a[i]` in the string `b` starting from index `j`. If it finds `a[i]` in `b`, it increments `k` and moves `j` to the next position. If it doesn't find `a[i]` in the remaining part of `b`, it breaks out of the loop.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce the final state after all iterations:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - `a` and `b` are binary strings of lengths `n` and `m` respectively.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.

2. **After 1st iteration**:
   - If `j < m` and `b[j] == a[0]`, then `k` becomes 1 and `j` is incremented by 1.
   - If `j == m` or `b[j] != a[0]` for all `j < m`, then `k` remains 0 and `j` becomes `m`.

3. **After 2nd iteration**:
   - If `j < m` and `b[j] == a[1]`, then `k` becomes 2 and `j` is incremented by 1.
   - If `j == m` or `b[j] != a[1]` for all `j < m`, then the loop breaks.

4. **After 3rd iteration**:
   - If `j < m` and `b[j] == a[2]`, then `k` becomes 3 and `j` is incremented by 1.
   - If `j == m` or `b[j] != a[2]` for all `j < m`, then the loop breaks.

**General behavior**:
- The loop continues until it either finds all characters of `a` in `b` in order or until it runs out of characters in `b` to check against `a`.

**Final Output State**:
- After all iterations, `k` will be the number of characters in `a` that were found in `b` in order, starting from index `j`.
- `j` will be the index in `b` where the search stopped.

Given the loop's behavior, the final output state can be described as follows:

- If all characters of `a` are found in `b` in order, `k` will be equal to `n` and `j` will be the index in `b` right after the last matched character.
- If not all characters of `a` are found in `b` in order, `k` will be the number of matched characters and `j` will be `m` (indicating that the search reached the end of `b`).

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` and `b` are binary strings of lengths `n` and `m` respectively; `k` is the number of characters from `a` found in `b` in order; `j` is the index in `b` where the search stopped (either `m` if the loop broke early or the index right after the last matched character if all characters were found).**
