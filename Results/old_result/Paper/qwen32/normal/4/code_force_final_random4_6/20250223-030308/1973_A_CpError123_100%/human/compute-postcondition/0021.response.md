Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2; `_` is 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the new input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2` (using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`); `y` is `a + b` (using the new values of `a` and `b`).**

The `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables. It simply passes control to the next iteration of the loop, if the code is inside a loop. Therefore, the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` retain their current values, with `x` and `y` recalculated based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` if the code is part of a loop that updates these values on each iteration.
