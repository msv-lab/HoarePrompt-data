Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15. The loop has finished executing all iterations, and `result` contains the values determined for each iteration.**

In simpler terms: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the variable `n` is now 0, indicating no more iterations will occur. The `result` list contains the calculated values for each iteration based on the inputs `x` and `y` provided for each test case. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen`) reflect the state after the final iteration.
