Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string that is being built based on the conditions described and now includes the character `a[i]`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than `len(a)`. `work` is a boolean flag that determines how `ans` is updated and whether `i` is incremented.**
