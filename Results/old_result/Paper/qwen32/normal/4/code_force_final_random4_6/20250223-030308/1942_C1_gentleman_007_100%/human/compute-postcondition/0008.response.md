The code appends the `node` to the deque `q`. This changes the state of `q` by adding `node` to it. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque containing `node`, `vis[ver]` is 1, and `node` is a vertex such that `vis[node]` is 0.**
