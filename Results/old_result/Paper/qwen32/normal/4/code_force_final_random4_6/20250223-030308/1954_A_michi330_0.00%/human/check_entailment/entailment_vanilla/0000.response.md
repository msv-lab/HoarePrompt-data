Let's break down the problem and the program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that Alice and Bob are painting a ribbon of `n` parts using `m` colors. Bob can repaint up to `k` parts to make all parts the same color. Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

For Alice to achieve her goal:
- She must paint the ribbon in such a way that no single color can dominate even after Bob repainted up to `k` parts.

### Key Observations

1. **Single Color Case (`m = 1`)**: If there is only one color, Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is `NO`.

2. **Small Ribbon or Few Colors (`n <= k` or `n / m <= k`)**: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color. Similarly, if the number of parts `n` divided by the number of colors `m` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. In both cases, the answer is `NO`.

3. **General Case**: If `n > k` and `n / m > k`, Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no single color can dominate even after Bob repainted `k` parts. This is because there will always be a color that is not frequent enough to be completely repainted by Bob. Therefore, the answer is `YES`.

### Program Analysis

The given program uses these observations to determine the answer:

- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It checks the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`:
  - If either condition is true, it prints `NO`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `YES`.

### Correctness Verification

- **Single Color Case (`m = 1`)**: The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` simplifies to `n - n < k` which is always false. However, the condition `n <= k` will correctly identify this case and print `NO`.

- **Small Ribbon or Few Colors (`n <= k` or `n / m <= k`)**: The condition `n <= k` directly covers the case where Bob can repaint all parts. The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` ensures that Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color if the parts are distributed among multiple colors.

- **General Case**: If neither of the conditions `n <= k` nor `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true, the program correctly prints `YES`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
