The provided Python code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is a function call to flush the output buffer. This operation does not affect the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, and `v2` are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `g` is 0; `v1` is 0; `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`; `kp` is incremented by 1; `v2` is `i`**.
