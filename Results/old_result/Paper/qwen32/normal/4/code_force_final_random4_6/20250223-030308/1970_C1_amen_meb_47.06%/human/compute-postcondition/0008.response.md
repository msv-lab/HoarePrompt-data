The code snippet appends a list containing `num1` and `num2` to the `numbers` list. Therefore, the `numbers` list will now contain one list element, which is `[num1, num2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is a list containing one element `[num1, num2]`; `nums` is a list of strings; `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`; `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`.**
