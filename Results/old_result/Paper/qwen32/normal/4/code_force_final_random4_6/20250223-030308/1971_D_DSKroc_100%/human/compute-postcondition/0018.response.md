The code snippet `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `s` is a string of length between 2 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', `i` is `i + 1`, `count` is incremented by 1**.
