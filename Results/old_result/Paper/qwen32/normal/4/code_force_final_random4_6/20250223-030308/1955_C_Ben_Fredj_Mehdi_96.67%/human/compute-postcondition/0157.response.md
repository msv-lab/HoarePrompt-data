Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[0]` is decremented by 1. If `a[d]` was 0, then `d` is `len(a) - 2`; otherwise, `d` remains `len(a) - 1`. The last element `a[d]` is decremented by 1 and is 0 if the if condition was true. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is an integer value of at least 2; `z` is incremented by 1; `g` is 1 if `a[g]` (which is `a[0]`) was 0, otherwise `g` remains 0; `i` is 0; the current value of `a[g]` (which is `a[1]` if `g` became 1) is unchanged.**
