The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Given that `i` is 1, `i % 2` equals 1, which means 'B' will be appended to the `pattern` list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an even integer and `n` is at least 2, `pattern` is a list with three elements, the last of which is 'B', `i` is 1**.
