Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it constructs the string for even values of `n`. The code attempts to create a pattern where each pair of characters alternates between 'A' and 'B', but the logic for generating the pattern is incorrect.

Here's an example of where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
2
2
4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
AB
YES
ABAB
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
AB
YES
ABBA
```

In the actual output for `n=4`, the string "ABBA" is generated. However, this string does not meet the criteria of having exactly 4 special characters. The special characters in "ABBA" are at positions 1 and 4, so there are only 2 special characters, not 4.

The correct pattern for `n=4` should be "ABAB" or any other string that has exactly 4 special characters.

The problem lies in the line:
```python
pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
```
This line does not correctly alternate the characters. Instead, it uses bitwise XOR (`^`), which is not the correct approach for alternating characters.

A correct approach to generate the pattern would be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('A')
                pattern.append('B')
            print(''.join(pattern))
```

This corrected version ensures that the pattern alternates correctly between 'A' and 'B', resulting in a string with the correct number of special characters.
