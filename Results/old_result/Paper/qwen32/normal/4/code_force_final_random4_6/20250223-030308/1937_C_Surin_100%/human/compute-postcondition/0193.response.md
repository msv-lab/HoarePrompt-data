Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: Unchanged, but its value is not specified.
2. **`n`**: Greater than `i + 1`, indicating `n` is some integer larger than `i + 1`.
3. **`kp`**: Incremented by 1, but its value is not specified.
4. **`g`**: Set to 0.
5. **`v1`**: The last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received).
6. **`v2`**: Set to `n - 1`.
7. **`r`**: The new input string, but its value is not specified.
8. **`prev`**: Unchanged, but its value is not specified.
9. **`r2`**: Unchanged, but its value is not specified.
10. **`i`**: Unchanged, but its value is not specified.
11. **Output buffer**: Flushed, meaning any previous output is cleared.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```
This statement will print a formatted string with the following components:
- `?`: A literal question mark.
- `{i}`: The value of `i` (repeated twice).
- `{prev}`: The value of `prev` (repeated twice).

### Determining the Output:
From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is unchanged, but its exact value is not given.
- `prev` is unchanged, but its exact value is not given.

Since the exact values of `i` and `prev` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output a string that starts with `?`, followed by the value of `i` twice, and then the value of `prev` twice.

Output: **? [i] [i] [prev] [prev] (where [i] is the unchanged value of i and [prev] is the unchanged value of prev)**
