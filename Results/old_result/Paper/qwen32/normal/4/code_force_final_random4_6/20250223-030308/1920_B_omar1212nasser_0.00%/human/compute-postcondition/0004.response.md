The code snippet calculates the sum of the elements in the list `elements` and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variables `removals`, `negatives`, and `pos` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`removals` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, `elements` is a list of integers representing the array, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements`.**
