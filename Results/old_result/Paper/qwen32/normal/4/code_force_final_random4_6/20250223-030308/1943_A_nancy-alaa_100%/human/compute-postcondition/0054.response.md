Given the initial state:
- `n` is at least 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `mpp` and `first` remain unchanged (though they are not used in the print statement, so we can ignore them for this task).

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the value of `i` based on the given precondition. Since `i` is defined as `n - 1`, the value of `i` depends on the value of `n`.

- If `n` is 0, then `i` will be `0 - 1`, which is `-1`.
- If `n` is 1, then `i` will be `1 - 1`, which is `0`.
- If `n` is 2, then `i` will be `2 - 1`, which is `1`.
- And so on...

Since `n` is at least 0, the value of `i` will be `n - 1`, which could be any integer from `-1` upwards depending on the specific value of `n`.

However, without a specific value for `n`, we can only describe `i` in terms of `n`.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is at least 0)**
