Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the integer value of the first input; `k` is the second input value (converted to an integer); `t` is 5 if the loop breaks due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `t` is `k % 2` from the last iteration; `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1; `k` is the remaining value after all possible reductions; `a` is the list of integers from the input; `l` is 0; `ans` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `ans` is increased by 1, and if `a[0]` was 0, `l` is set to 1, `a[l]` is set to `a[1]`, and `ans` is 1; otherwise, `l` remains 0. If `a[r]` is not 0, the state remains as described without changes to `r`, `l`, or `ans`. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[l] == 0` or `a[r] == 0` in the if part, or if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0` in the else part. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are decreased by `mi`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is `k % 2` and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r] == 0`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are decremented by `mi`. If `a[l] == 0`, `l` is set to 1; otherwise, `l` remains 0. If `a[r] == 0`, `r` is set to `n - 2`; otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1`. If `mi * 2 > k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
