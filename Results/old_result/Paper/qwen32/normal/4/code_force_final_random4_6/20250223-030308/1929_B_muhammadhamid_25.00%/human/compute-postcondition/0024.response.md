To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- If `k` is equal to 1, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. 
- There is no else part to handle cases where `k` is not equal to 1, meaning `n` and `k` remain unchanged regardless of the value of `k`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. The `math.ceil()` function rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
2. The expression inside the `math.ceil()` function is `k / 2`, which is the division of `k` by 2.
3. The value of `k` can be any integer, as no specific constraints are given other than it being the second input integer.
4. The result of `k / 2` will be a float.
5. The `math.ceil()` function will then round this float up to the nearest integer.

### Specific Cases:
- If `k` is 1:
  - `k / 2` is `0.5`.
  - `math.ceil(0.5)` is `1`.
- If `k` is 2:
  - `k / 2` is `1.0`.
  - `math.ceil(1.0)` is `1`.
- If `k` is 3:
  - `k / 2` is `1.5`.
  - `math.ceil(1.5)` is `2`.
- If `k` is 4:
  - `k / 2` is `2.0`.
  - `math.ceil(2.0)` is `2`.
- And so on...

### General Case:
- For any integer `k`, `math.ceil(k / 2)` will return the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print` statement will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is the second input integer)**
