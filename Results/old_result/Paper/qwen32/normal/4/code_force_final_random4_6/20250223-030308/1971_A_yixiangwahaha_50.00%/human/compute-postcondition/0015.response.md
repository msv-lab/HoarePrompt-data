Output State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[0]` from ten different inputs, `y` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[1]` from ten different inputs, `i` is 10.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all 10 iterations, `x` and `y` will each contain 10 integers, each pair of which corresponds to the two integers read from each of the 10 inputs. The variable `i` will have reached the value 10, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases, remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
