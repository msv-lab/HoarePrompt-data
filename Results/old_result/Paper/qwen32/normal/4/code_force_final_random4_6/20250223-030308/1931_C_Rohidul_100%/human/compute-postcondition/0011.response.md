The code increments the variable `st` by 1. Therefore, the value of `st` changes from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is at least 3; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 2; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 3; `end` is 1.**
