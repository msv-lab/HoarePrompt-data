To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

The loop is defined as:
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop definition, we can see that `j` is the loop variable and it iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is `n + 1`, indicating that the previous iteration completed with `j` equal to `n`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` was `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has already completed all its iterations. Therefore, to start the loop again, `j` should be reset to its initial value, which is 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\)**
