The code snippet `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the `queue`, which is a tuple containing the current node and its distance. This tuple is then unpacked into the variables `current` and `dist`.

Given the initial state:
- `queue` must contain at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances.
- `visited` contains all visited nodes.
- `current` is `start`.
- `dist` is 0.
- `start` and `target` remain unchanged.

After executing the code:
- The leftmost element of `queue` is removed and assigned to `current` and `dist`.
- The `queue` now has one less element than before.
- `current` and `dist` are updated to the values of the first element in the `queue`.

Output State: **`queue` contains at least one less tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, `visited` contains all visited nodes, `current` is the first node from the `queue`, `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged.**
