Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values, `m` is `n - num`.**

In this output state, the variable `m` has been updated to be equal to `n - num`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `num`) retain their initial values and states as described.
