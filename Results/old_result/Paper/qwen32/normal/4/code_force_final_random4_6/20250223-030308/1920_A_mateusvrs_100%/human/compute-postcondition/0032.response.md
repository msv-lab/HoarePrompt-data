To determine the final state after the loop has executed all `n` iterations, we need to consider how the variables `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` are updated based on the input values `a` and `x` during each iteration.

1. **Variable `ax`**: This variable keeps track of the minimum value encountered when `a` is 2. It starts with a very large number (1000000007) and is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x` whenever `a` is 2.

2. **Variable `bx`**: This variable keeps track of the maximum value encountered when `a` is 1. It starts with -1 and is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x` whenever `a` is 1.

3. **Variable `cx`**: This is a set that collects all values of `x` when `a` is neither 1 nor 2.

After `n` iterations, the final values of `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` will be:

- `ax` will be the smallest `x` value encountered when `a` was 2.
- `bx` will be the largest `x` value encountered when `a` was 1.
- `cx` will be a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2.

The variables `t`, `n`, `r`, and the precondition constraints about the types of constraints will remain unchanged.

**Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is the minimum `x` value encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, and `cx` is a set of all `x` values encountered when `a` was neither 1 nor 2.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations:
- `ax` holds the smallest value of `x` from all type 2 constraints.
- `bx` holds the largest value of `x` from all type 1 constraints.
- `cx` is a set of all `x` values from constraints that are neither type 1 nor type 2.
