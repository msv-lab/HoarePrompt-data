The value of `ans1` is decreased by `a[i] * 2`. The value of `i` is already `i + 1` from the initial state, so `a[i]` refers to the next element in the sorted list `a` in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` remain unchanged, only `ans1` is modified.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input where `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans1` is decreased by `a[i] * 2`.**
