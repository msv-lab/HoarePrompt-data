Let's break down the given print statement and understand what it will output based on the initial state provided.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Integer Division (`//`)**:
   - `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` will perform integer division of each variable by 2, effectively halving the value and discarding any remainder.

2. **Modulo Operation (`%`)**:
   - `a % 2`, `b % 2`, `c % 2` will give the remainder when `a`, `b`, and `c` are divided by 2, respectively. The result will be either 0 (if the number is even) or 1 (if the number is odd).

3. **Sum of Remainders**:
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2` will sum the remainders from the modulo operations.
   - The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` will evaluate to `1` if the sum of the remainders is exactly 3, otherwise it will evaluate to `0`.

4. **Combining the Results**:
   - The final result will be the sum of the integer divisions plus the result of the condition `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`.

### Explanation of the Condition:
- The condition `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3` will only be true if all three numbers (`a`, `b`, and `c`) are odd. In this case, each modulo operation will yield 1, and their sum will be 3. If any of the numbers are even, the sum will be less than 3, and the condition will be false.

### Final Output:
Given that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, the output will be the sum of their halved values plus 1 if `a`, `b`, and `c` are all odd, otherwise it will be the sum of their halved values.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)) (where a, b, c, and d are integers)**
