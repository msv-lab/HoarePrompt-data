Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `s` is 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input value that must have at least 1 element; `j` is 0; `b[j]` is equal to '*'. If `b` is not empty, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `b[j + 1]` is equal to '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.**

To simplify: **`t`, `n`, `path`, `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, and `j` retain their initial values. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `b` is not empty or if `b[j + 1]` is equal to '*'. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.**
