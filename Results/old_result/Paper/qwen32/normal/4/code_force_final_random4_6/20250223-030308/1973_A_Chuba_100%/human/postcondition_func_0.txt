The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integer scores in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it prints either `-1` if the sum of the scores is odd, or a calculated value representing half the sum of the scores minus the maximum of zero or the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.
