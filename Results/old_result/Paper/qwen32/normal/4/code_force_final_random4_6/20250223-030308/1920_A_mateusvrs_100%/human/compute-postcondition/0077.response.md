The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` is a set, it will contain unique elements only. The values of `n`, `a`, `bx`, `ax`, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than the current value of `_` + 1 remain unchanged. The only change is that `x` is added to `cx`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than the current value of `_` + 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input; `bx`, `ax` remain unchanged; `cx` contains the previous elements plus `x`.**
