Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), which represents the length of a permutation `p`. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided permutation `p`.**
