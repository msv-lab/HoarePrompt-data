Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v`, the list at index `v` contains the values `v` and `u`, and all other lists remain empty; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1. `u` and `v` are now assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

In simpler terms, the list `u2vs` and its initial structure remain unchanged. The variables `u` and `v` are updated to be the first and second integers from the input, respectively, each minus 1.
