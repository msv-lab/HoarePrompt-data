#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values representing the number of disks and their respective coordinates and radii. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) to process each disk, updating coefficients and marking disks as visited. The function determines if there is at least one iteration where a specific condition (c1 != 0) is met and prints "YES" if true, otherwise prints "NO".

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search starting from a given disk index `i` to identify all disks that are part of the same connected component. It updates the `visited` list to mark these disks as visited, appends their indices to the `nodes` list, and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for these disks based on their radii and positions.
