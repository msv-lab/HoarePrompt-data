The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts `2 * a[i]` from the current value of `ans1`. Given that `i` is `x - 1`, this means `a[i]` refers to the `x`-th element in the list `a` (considering 1-based indexing for `x`).

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input with `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x - 1`; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `4 * a[i]`; `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations.**

In natural language: The value of `ans1` is now the sum of the list `a` minus four times the `x`-th element of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
