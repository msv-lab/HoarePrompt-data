The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range specified by `n`. The loop decrements `i` in each iteration, starting from `n` down to `1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is \(n-1\). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 to \(n-2\). The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\), `i` is \(n-2\)**
