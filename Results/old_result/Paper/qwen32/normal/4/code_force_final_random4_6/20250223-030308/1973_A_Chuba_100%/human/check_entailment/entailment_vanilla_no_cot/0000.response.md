To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws based on the provided problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the total points `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` are even. This is correct because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win and a loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw), so the total points must be even.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. This formula is designed to maximize the number of draws while ensuring that the scores are consistent.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is odd, the program correctly returns `-1`.
   - The formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` ensures that the number of draws is maximized and that the scores are consistent. For instance:
     - If `v[0] = 0`, `v[1] = 0`, `v[2] = 0`, no games were played, so the number of draws is `0`.
     - If `v[0] = 0`, `v[1] = 1`, `v[2] = 1`, one draw occurred between the second and third player, so the number of draws is `1`.
     - If `v[0] = 1`, `v[1] = 1`, `v[2] = 2`, two draws occurred (one between the second and third player, and one between the first and third player), so the number of draws is `2`.
     - If `v[0] = 1`, `v[1] = 1`, `v[2] = 10`, this is impossible to achieve with the given rules, so the program correctly returns `-1`.

After careful analysis, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or if the scores are inconsistent.
