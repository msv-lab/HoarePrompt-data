The given code appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, the list at index `v` already contains the value `v`, and all other lists are empty. After the operation, the list at index `v` will contain both `v` and `u`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v`, the list at index `v` contains the values `v` and `u`, and all other lists remain empty; `u` is the first integer from the input minus 1; `v` is the second integer from the input minus 1.**
