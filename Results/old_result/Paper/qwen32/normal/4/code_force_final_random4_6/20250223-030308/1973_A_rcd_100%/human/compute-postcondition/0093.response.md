Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program does not execute the else part. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the loop will print either `p1 - x + p3` if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met at any point during the iterations, or `p3` if `y` becomes less than `x` without meeting the condition. The values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` equals `p3` and `y` equals `0` if the loop exits without breaking.**
