Postcondition: **`a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `i` is 2. If the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is greater than `x`, `ind` is [1, 2] and `c` is `c + 1`. Otherwise, `ind` remains [1] if the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` was initially greater than `x`, or an empty list if it was not. If `c` was initially 2 and the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is greater than `x`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `c` remains 0 or 2 based on its initial value and the comparison with `x`.**
