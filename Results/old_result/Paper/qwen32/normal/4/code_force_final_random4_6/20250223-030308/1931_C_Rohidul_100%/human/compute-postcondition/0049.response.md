Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is an index such that `l < n - 1` and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is 2, `ans` retains its original value.**

The value of `end` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. All other variables retain their original values.
