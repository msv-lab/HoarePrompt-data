Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `M` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, `cost` is `mu * w`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` has been recalculated to be `mu * w`, where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`. All other variables retain their previously defined states and values.
