To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the `while` loop condition. The loop condition is `i < len(a)`, so the variables `i` and `len(a)` are relevant.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace
- `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace
- `ans` is an empty string
- `i` is 0
- `work` is True

The loop condition `i < len(a)` will be true if `i` is less than the length of the string `a`. Since `i` is 0, the only requirement is that `len(a)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of the string `a`. It must be ensured that `a` is not an empty string, as an empty string would make `len(a)` equal to 0, and the loop condition would not be satisfied.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is 0; `work` is True**
