Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer input by the user, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order, `i` is 2. If `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `removed_count` is 3. Otherwise, `removed_count` is 1. `favorite_count` remains undefined.**
