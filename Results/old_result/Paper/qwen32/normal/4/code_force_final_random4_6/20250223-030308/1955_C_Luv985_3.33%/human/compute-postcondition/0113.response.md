The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `k % 2`, `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element reduced by `mi` and the last element further reduced by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`; otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[r])`, `l` is 0, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**
