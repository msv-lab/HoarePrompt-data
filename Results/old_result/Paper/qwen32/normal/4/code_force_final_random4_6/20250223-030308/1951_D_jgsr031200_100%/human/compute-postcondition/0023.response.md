The code snippet `n -= i * curr` subtracts the product of `i` and `curr` from `n`. Given the initial state, `n` is 0, `i` is 1, and `curr` is 0. Therefore, `i * curr` equals `1 * 0`, which is 0. Subtracting 0 from `n` does not change the value of `n`.

Thus, the value of `n` remains 0. The other variables (`k`, `costs`, `h`, `curr`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list `[1 - k, 1]`, `h` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1**
