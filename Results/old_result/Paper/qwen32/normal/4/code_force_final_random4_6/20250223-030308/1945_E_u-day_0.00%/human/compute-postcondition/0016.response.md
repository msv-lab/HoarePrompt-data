To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to execute, we need to ensure that the condition `low + 1 < high` is true. Let's analyze the variables involved:

- `low` is initialized to 0.
- `high` is initialized to `n - 1`.

The condition `low + 1 < high` must hold true for the loop to execute. Given `low` is 0, the condition simplifies to `1 < high`.

Thus, `high` must be greater than 1 for the loop to proceed. Since `high` is initialized to `n - 1`, we need `n - 1 > 1`, which implies `n > 2`.

No other variables (`pos` or `st`) are part of the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n > 2`.

State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 2; `st` is an empty set.**
