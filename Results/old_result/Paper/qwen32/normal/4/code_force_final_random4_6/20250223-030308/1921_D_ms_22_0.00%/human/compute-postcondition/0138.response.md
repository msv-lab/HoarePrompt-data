The code snippet `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. None of the other variables listed are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` has one less element, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated based on the conditions, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp1` is incremented by 1**.

In simpler terms, the value of `tp1` has increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
