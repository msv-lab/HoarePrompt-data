The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

Given that `i` is the current element being processed from the list `a` and `a` contains `n` integers, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element processed. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be the next element in the list `a`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the list. If the previous `i` was the last element of `a`, then the loop should not execute again because there are no more elements in `a`.

However, if there are more elements in `a` to process, `i` should be the next element in the list. Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration was not specified (other than it being an element of `a`), we can denote the next element in the list as the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, and `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`. `i` is the next element in the list `a`**.
