Postcondition: **`i` is `i + 1`; `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`; `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`; `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. The relationship between `upper` and `lower` is such that if `upper > lower`, the condition is met; otherwise, the else part is executed, but the values of `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` remain the same in both cases.**
