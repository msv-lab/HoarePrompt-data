The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3, 4, or 5, and `n` must be greater than `i`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `ar` is a new list of integers with a length greater than 1, we need to ensure that `i` is less than this length.

Given that `i` is currently either 3, 4, or 5, the length of `ar` must be at least 6 to ensure that `i` can be incremented to a value less than the length of `ar` and the loop can execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than or equal to 6; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 3, 4, or 5; `num` is `ar[i]` if `i` is 3 or 4, otherwise `ar[2]`; `same` is 3 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` initially, otherwise `same` is 1; `minn` is 1**
