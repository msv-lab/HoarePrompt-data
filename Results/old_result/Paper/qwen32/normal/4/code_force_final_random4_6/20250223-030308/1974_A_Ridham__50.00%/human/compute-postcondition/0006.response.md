The code snippet calculates the `total_space` by adding `space_x` and `space_y`. Given the initial state, `space_x` is equal to `x` and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`. Therefore, `total_space` will be `x + y * 4`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `result`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. Only `total_space` is newly defined or updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`.**
