Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is an input integer, `y` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is an input integer, `r` is a list of integers with length `n` where each element is an input integer, `visited` is a list of boolean values initialized to `False` with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `c0` is `sum_coef0`, `c1` is `sum_coef1`, and `ok` is updated to `ok or c1 != 0`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `c0`, `c1`, or `ok`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, `nodes` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `visited[1]` is `True`, then `visited[1]` is `True`, `coef0[1]` is `0`, `coef1[1]` is `1`, `nodes` contains the integer `1`, `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `1`, and `ok` is `True`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `c0`, `c1`, or `ok`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers with length `n`, `y` is a list of integers with length `n`, `r` is a list of integers with length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values with length `n`, `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef0[2]` and `coef0[3]` which are updated to some values if `visited[2]` was `False`, `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except `coef1[2]` and `coef1[3]` which are updated to some values if `visited[2]` was `False`, `nodes` is a list containing the integers `2` and `3` if `visited[2]` was `False`, otherwise `nodes` contains the integer `2`, `i` is 2, `c0` is `coef0[2] + coef0[3]` if `visited[2]` was `False`, otherwise `c0` is `0`, `c1` is `coef1[2] + coef1[3]` if `visited[2]` was `False`, otherwise `c1` is `1`, and `ok` is `True` if `visited[2]` was `False`, otherwise `ok` is `True`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
