Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace and must have at least 2 characters; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string constructed based on the conditions described; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `work` is a boolean flag that can be either True or False; `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', the condition is met; otherwise, `a[j + 1]` is not equal to `b[j]`, and either `a[j + 1]` is not '0' or `b[j]` is not '1', leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
