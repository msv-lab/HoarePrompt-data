Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`; `k`, an integer; and `nums`, a list of `n` integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` based on the cumulative sums of elements from the start and end of the list `nums` and returns `ans`.**
