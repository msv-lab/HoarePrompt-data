The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` remains unchanged.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4.
- `max_item_idx` is set to `i` if `ans` was equal to '<', otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

To adjust the state for the start of the next iteration:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value (which it already has been at the end of the previous iteration).
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is set to `i` if `ans` was equal to '<', otherwise it remains unchanged, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

However, since `i` has already been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we just need to reflect that `i` is now one more than its previous value. So the state can be simplified to:
State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is set to `i` if `ans` was equal to '<', otherwise it remains unchanged, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `i` is now the next integer value**.

To be more precise in the context of the loop:
State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is set to `i` if `ans` was equal to '<', otherwise it remains unchanged, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Since `i` has already been incremented by 1, we can simply state:
State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is set to `i` if `ans` was equal to '<', otherwise it remains unchanged, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `i` is the next integer value in the range**.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is set to `i` if `ans` was equal to '<', otherwise it remains unchanged, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Simplified for the loop head variables:
State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
