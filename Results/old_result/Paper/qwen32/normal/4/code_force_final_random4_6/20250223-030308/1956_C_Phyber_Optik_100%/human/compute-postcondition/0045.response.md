The value of `sum` is reassigned to 1. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `j` is an input integer + 1, `t` is t - 1, `sum` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `j` is an input integer + 1, `t` is t - 1, `sum` is 1.**
