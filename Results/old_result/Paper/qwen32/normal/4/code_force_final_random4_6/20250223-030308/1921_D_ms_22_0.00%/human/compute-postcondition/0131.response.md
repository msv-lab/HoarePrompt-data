Output State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is `ans + diff`, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples of the form `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)`. `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`. The `index_in_b` of `item` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, and `index_in_b` of `item` is not equal to `tp1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
