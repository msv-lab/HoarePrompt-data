Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input with `x` greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x`; if `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the previous value of `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`; `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`; `k` is greater than 0. If `i + x` is not less than `n`, `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged. `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`**

Explanation: The code only updates `ans2` by taking the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The conditions and states of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain as described in the initial state, with the only change being the updated value of `ans2` to be the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value.
