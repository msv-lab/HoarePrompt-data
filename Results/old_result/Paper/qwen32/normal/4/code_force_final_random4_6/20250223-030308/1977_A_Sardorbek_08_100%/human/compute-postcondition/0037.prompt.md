Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    q = b, c
    if b == c:
        print('YES')
    elif b < c:
        print('NO')
    elif b % 2 == c % 2:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` is equal to `c`, no additional changes occur. If `b` is not equal to `c`, no additional changes occur unless `b` and `c` have different parities, in which case `b % 2` is not equal to `c % 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, and `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` is equal to `c`, no additional changes occur. If `b` is not equal to `c`, no additional changes occur unless `b` and `c` have different parities, in which case `b % 2` is not equal to `c % 2`. If `b` is less than `c`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, no additional changes occur regardless of whether `b` is equal to `c` or if they have different parities.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` and `c` are the new integers from the input, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` after the input, and `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `b == c`, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `b < c`, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `b > c`, the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is checked, and regardless of whether it is true or false, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
