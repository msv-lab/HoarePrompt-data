The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The initial conditions for `t` remain unchanged. The Output State will reflect the new value of `x` while keeping the conditions for `t` and `X` as they were.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is an input integer.**
