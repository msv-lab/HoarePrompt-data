The given initial state describes the variables `n` and `k` as input integers, and a condition for a loop to execute if the next input value is greater than 0. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not depend on these variables or the loop condition. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Since the `print(1)` statement is independent of the values of `n`, `k`, and the loop condition, it will always output the number `1`.

Output: **1**
