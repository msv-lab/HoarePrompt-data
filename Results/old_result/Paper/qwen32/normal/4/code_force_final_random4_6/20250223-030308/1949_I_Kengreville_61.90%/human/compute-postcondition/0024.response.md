Postcondition: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is the difference between `x[i]` and `x[j]`; `dy` is the difference between `y[i]` and `y[j]`. If `visited[j]` is False and the sum of the squares of the radii of disks `i` and `j` equals the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`, then `coef0[j]` is assigned the value `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`, and `dfs(j)` is executed. Otherwise, no changes are made to `coef0[j]`, `coef1[j]`, or `visited[j]`.**
