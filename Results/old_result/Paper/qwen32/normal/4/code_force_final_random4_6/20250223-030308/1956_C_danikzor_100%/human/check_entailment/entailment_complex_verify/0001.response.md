Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to verify whether it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: To maximize the sum, each element in the matrix should be as large as possible. The optimal strategy is to fill each row and each column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]. This ensures that the highest possible numbers are placed in the matrix, thus maximizing the sum.
2. **Operations**: The problem allows up to \( 2n \) operations. Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, we can fill each row and each column once, using exactly \( 2n \) operations.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows this strategy:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
2. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix, which is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \). This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and their permutations.
3. **Operations**: The program then outputs \( 2n \) operations, where the first \( n \) operations fill each row with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], and the next \( n \) operations fill each column with the same permutation.

### Verification:
- **Sum Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the sum is correct for the maximum sum achievable with the described operations. The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is indeed the sum of squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is the sum of all elements in the matrix if each row and column is filled with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1].
- **Operations**: The operations specified are valid and ensure that each row and column is filled with the highest possible permutation, thus achieving the maximum sum.

### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
- Before the function call, the program reads the number of test cases and the size of the matrix for each test case.
- Inside the function, the program calculates the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \).
- The loop outputs \( 2n \) lines, where each pair of lines corresponds to filling a row and a column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1].

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected and the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
