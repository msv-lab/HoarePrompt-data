Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0; `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`; `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i]`; `elements` is unchanged; `i` is unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after executing the code, `removals` remains greater than 0, `s` keeps its previously updated value, `s2` is further reduced by the value of `elements[-i]`, `elements` remains unchanged, and `i` remains unchanged.
