Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing the element `a[0]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set; `extra` is an empty set if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains the integer `a[0]`; `j` is 0; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.**
