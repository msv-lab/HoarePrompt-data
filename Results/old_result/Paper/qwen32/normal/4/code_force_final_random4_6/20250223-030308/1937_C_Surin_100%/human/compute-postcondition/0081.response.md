The code snippet `r = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `prev`, `kp`, `v2`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `g` is 0; `v1` is 0; `prev` is the last `i` for which `r` was `'>'` or `r` was `'='` and `r2` was `'<'`; `kp` is incremented by 1; `v2` is `i`; `r` is the input string.**
