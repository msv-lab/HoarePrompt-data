Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is 1, and the `i`-th character of `s1` is equal to the `i`-th character of `s2`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the `i`-th character of `s1` is equal to the `i`-th character of `s2` still holds true for the new value of `i`.
