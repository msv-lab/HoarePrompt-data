The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))` pushes a new tuple into the `max_heap`. This tuple contains the negative of `diff2`, the current value of `i`, and `m - 1`. The values of `diff2`, `i`, and `m` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)` and `(-abs(new_i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`, and `max_heap` now also contains `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.

In natural language: The `max_heap` now includes an additional tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
