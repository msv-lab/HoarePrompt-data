Output State: **`n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing a single element `0`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists.**

In this output state, the only change is that a new variable `inds` has been introduced, which is a `defaultdict` of lists. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.
