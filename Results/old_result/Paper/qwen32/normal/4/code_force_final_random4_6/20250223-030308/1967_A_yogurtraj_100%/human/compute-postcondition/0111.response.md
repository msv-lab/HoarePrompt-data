The code snippet assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Given that `i` is 3, `r` will be assigned the value of `a[4]`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 3, `k` is reduced by `4 * (a[4] - a[3])`, `r` is `a[4]`.**
