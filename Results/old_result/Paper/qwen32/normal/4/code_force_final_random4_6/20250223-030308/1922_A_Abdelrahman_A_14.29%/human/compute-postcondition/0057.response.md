Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` and `b` are input strings, `c` is the input string, `slength` is the input integer, `tests` is greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `c` equals `a` or `c` equals `b`, then `no` is set to False. Otherwise, `no` is set to False and the loop breaks if any character in `c` is not in `a` or `b`; otherwise, `no` remains True after all characters in `c` are checked.**
