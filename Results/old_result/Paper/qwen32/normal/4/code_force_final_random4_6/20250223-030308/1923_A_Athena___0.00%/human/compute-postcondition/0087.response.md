Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer. If the current element at index `i` of `a` is 0, `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is incremented by 1. If `res` was initially 1 (which would be the case if the current element at index `i` of `a` was 0), it becomes 2. If `res` was initially 0 (which would be the case if the current element at index `i` of `a` was not 0), it becomes 1. The values of `a`, `i`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.
