You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who move their chips on a checkered board. The goal is to land on the opponent's chip's position. Alice moves her chip down, down-right, or down-left, while Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left. The game ends in a draw if a player cannot make a move.

### Key Observations

1. **Alice's and Bob's Moves**:
   - Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left.
   - Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
   
2. **Winning Condition**:
   - A player wins if they move to the cell occupied by the other player.
   - If a player cannot make a move, the game is a draw.
   
3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players will play optimally to win the game or force a draw.
   - The game's outcome depends on the initial positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board.

### Solution Analysis

The provided solution seems to use a strategy based on the distance between Alice's and Bob's initial positions and the board's dimensions. Let's break down the solution:

- **Input Parsing**:
  - The code reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.
  
- **Decision Logic**:
  - If Alice's row (`a`) is greater than Bob's row (`c`), the game is a draw because Alice cannot move further down.
  - If Alice's row is less than or equal to Bob's row, the code calculates the maximum distance Alice can move vertically (`x = abs(a - c) // 2`).
  - Depending on whether the vertical distance is even or odd, the code calculates the range of columns Alice can reach (`l` to `r`).
  - It then checks if Bob's chip is within this range and determines the winner based on the conditions.

### Issues in the Solution

The logic in the solution seems flawed. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Vertical Distance Calculation**:
   - The vertical distance (`x`) is calculated as `abs(a - c) // 2`. This seems to assume that Alice can move halfway to Bob's row, but this is not necessarily true because Alice can move diagonally.
   
2. **Column Range Calculation**:
   - The calculation of the column range (`l` to `r`) is based on the vertical distance, which is not correct. Alice can move diagonally, so the column range should be based on the Manhattan distance or some other metric that considers diagonal moves.
   
3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The conditions to determine the winner are not correctly implemented. The code checks if Bob's chip is within the range (`l` to `r`), but this does not account for the optimal moves and the possibility of Bob blocking Alice or vice versa.

### Conclusion

Given the above points, the provided solution does not correctly determine the game's outcome based on the problem's rules and optimal play. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.
