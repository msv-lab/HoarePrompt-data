The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, sorts this list in descending order, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are not affected by this code snippet. The output state will reflect the new value of `a` as a sorted list of integers in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order obtained from the input.**
