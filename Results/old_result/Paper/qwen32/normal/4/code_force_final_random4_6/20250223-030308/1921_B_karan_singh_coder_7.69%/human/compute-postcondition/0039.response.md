Postcondition: **`t` is a new string input by the user; `n` is a new input integer; `s` is the new string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`; `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; `i` is `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
