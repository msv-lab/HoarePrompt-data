The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string that is being built based on the conditions described and now includes the character `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `i` must be less than `len(a)`; `work` is a boolean flag that determines how `ans` is updated and whether `i` is incremented.**
