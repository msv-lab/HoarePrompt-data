The code appends the value of `i` to the list `ind`. Since `i` is 1, `ind` will now contain the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `i` is 1; `ind` is [1]; If `c` was 2, `c` remains 2. Otherwise, `c` remains 0. The current value of the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`.**
