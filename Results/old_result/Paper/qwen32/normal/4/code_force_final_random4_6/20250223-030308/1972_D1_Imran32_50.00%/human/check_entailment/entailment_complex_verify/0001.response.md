### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program code. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Key Observations:
- For a pair \((a, b)\) to satisfy the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\), it must be that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
- This simplifies to \(a = (k-1) \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Implementation Analysis:
The provided code does not follow the logic derived from the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code and its issues:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)).

2. **Logic Inside `func_1`:**
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates `cnt` as \(i^2\) and adds \((n + i) // cnt\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Issues with the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Input Variable:**
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly reads \(k\) instead of \(m\). This means the second input value is not being used as intended in the problem statement.

2. **Mismatched Logic:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem's requirements. It seems to be implementing a different algorithm, possibly for a different problem.
   - The code does not iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

3. **Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the function `func_1` is calculating a value based on \(n\) and does not involve \(m\) or the condition specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the problem requirements and the code's logic, the provided program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment correctly identifies these issues and concludes that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
