Postcondition: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to `(l + r) // 2` and `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `(l + r) // 2` and `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`. The value of `array[mid]` relative to `find` determines whether `l` or `r` is updated.**
