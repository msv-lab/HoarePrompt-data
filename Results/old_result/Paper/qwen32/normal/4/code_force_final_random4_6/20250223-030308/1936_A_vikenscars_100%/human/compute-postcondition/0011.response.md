To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code snippet on the variables. The code snippet provided is:

```python
ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
```

This line of code calls a function named `func_1` with four arguments, all of which are `max_item_idx` and `i` (twice each). The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

The variables `max_item_idx` and `i` are used in the function call, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output state in terms of these variables.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` will hold whatever value `func_1` returns when called with the arguments `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx`, `i`, and `i`.

The value of `i` is incremented from its previous value, but since we do not have the previous value of `i`, we can only state that `i` has been incremented.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `ans` holds the return value of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`**.
