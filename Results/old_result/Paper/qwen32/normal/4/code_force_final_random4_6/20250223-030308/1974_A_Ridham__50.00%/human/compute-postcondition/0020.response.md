The code snippet updates the value of `extra_screen` based on the value of `extra_space`. The value of `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is then calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1`.

Given that `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, `extra_space` will be a non-negative integer, and `extra_screen` will be at least 1 because we are adding 1 to the integer division result.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `result` is an empty list; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`; If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`. Otherwise, `y` is not divisible by 2, and `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`; `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`; `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`; `space_x` is not a multiple of 15.**
