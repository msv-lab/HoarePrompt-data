The code snippet provided only reads the integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not yet assigned any values in the given snippet. Therefore, only `t` is updated in the output state.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ `m`, `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 50) where `n` is the number of parts of the ribbon, `m` is the number of colors, and `k` is the number of parts Bob can repaint. `t` is an input integer.**
