Let's break down the print statement and understand what will be printed based on the given initial state:

1. **`'1 %d' % i`**:
   - The string `'1 %d'` is a format specifier where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - The variable `i` is given as `2`.
   - Therefore, `'1 %d' % i` will be formatted to `'1 2'`.

2. ***`range(1, n + 1)`***:
   - The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from the first argument (inclusive) to the second argument (exclusive).
   - Here, `n` is `5`.
   - So, `range(1, n + 1)` is `range(1, 6)`, which generates the sequence: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

3. **Combining the two parts**:
   - The `*` operator in the print statement unpacks the `range` object and prints each element separately.
   - Therefore, the entire print statement will output `'1 2'` followed by the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

Putting it all together, the output will be:

Output: **1 2 1 2 3 4 5**
