The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. None of the other variables (`t`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`, `minn`) are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the value of `n`, which is now set to the integer value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `ar` is a list of integers; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `num` is the value of the last element in the list `ar` or the value of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, it retains its value. Otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
