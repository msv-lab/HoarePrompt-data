The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by converting the substring of `a` up to the first space into an integer. The variables `t`, `a`, and `z` remain unchanged, while `n` is now an integer derived from the input string `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is the input string; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of `a` up to the first space; `k` is no longer valid as derived from the original `a`.**
