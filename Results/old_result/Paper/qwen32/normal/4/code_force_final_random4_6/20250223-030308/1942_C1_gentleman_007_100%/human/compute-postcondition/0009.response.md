Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque containing `node`, `vis[ver]` is 1, and `vis[node]` is 1.**

In natural language: The value of `vis[node]` has been changed to 1, indicating that the vertex `node` has now been visited. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
