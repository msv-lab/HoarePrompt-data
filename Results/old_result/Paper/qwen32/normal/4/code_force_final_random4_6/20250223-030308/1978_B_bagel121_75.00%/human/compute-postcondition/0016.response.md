The code snippet assigns a value to `p2` based on the expression `(n - k) * a`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

The value of `p2` is now `(n - k) * a`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
