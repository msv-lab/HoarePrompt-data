### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, program code, and annotated version.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- Nikita can either add or remove one cube from the tower in one move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**Key Observations:**
1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes (even).
2. **Possible Moves**: Each move either adds or removes 1 cube, changing the parity of the number of cubes.
3. **Parity Check**: After an even number of moves, the number of cubes must be even. After an odd number of moves, the number of cubes must be odd.

**Conditions to Determine Possibility:**
1. **Equal Moves and Cubes**: If `n == m`, it's possible to have `m` cubes by adding 1 cube in each move.
2. **More Moves than Cubes**: If `n < m`, it's impossible because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
3. **Parity Check**: If `n > m`, `m` must have the same parity as `n` (both odd or both even).

**Program Analysis:**

Let's compare the logic in the provided program with the conditions derived from the problem statement:

1. **First Condition**: `if b == c: print('YES')`
   - This checks if `n == m`. If true, it correctly prints "YES".

2. **Second Condition**: `elif b < c: print('NO')`
   - This checks if `n < m`. If true, it correctly prints "NO".

3. **Third Condition**: `elif b % 2 == c % 2: print('Yes')`
   - This checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity. If true, it correctly prints "YES".

4. **Else Condition**: `else: print('No')`
   - This handles the remaining cases, which are when `n > m` and `n` and `m` have different parity. It correctly prints "NO".

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

Let's look at the annotated code to ensure it matches the logic:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

**Annotations:**
- The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
- For each test case, it reads `b` and `c`.
- It checks the conditions in the order:
  1. If `b == c`, it prints "YES".
  2. If `b < c`, it prints "NO".
  3. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (`b % 2 == c % 2`), it prints "YES".
  4. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The annotated code correctly reflects the logic derived from the problem statement. The conditions are checked in the correct order, and the output is as expected for each case.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic based on the conditions derived from the problem statement. It handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each scenario.

**Final Evaluation:**

Final: **True**
