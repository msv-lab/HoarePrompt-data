The code snippet `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[4]` to the set `done`. Given the initial state, `done` already contains `a[4]` if `a[4]` was in `todo`. After executing the code, `done` will definitely contain `a[4]`, regardless of its initial state.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[4]` if `a[4]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[4]`; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and now `extra` also contains `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`; `j` is 4.**
