The only object in the loop head is the variable `node`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over each adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]`. At the end of the last iteration, `node` was the last vertex processed from `graph[ver]`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been iterated over.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph.
- `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more adjacent vertex.
- `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise.
- `q` is a deque. If `vis[node]` was 0, then `node` is appended to `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `q` remains unchanged and `vis[node]` remains 0.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `graph[ver]`, the next `node` should be the next adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed.

State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is a deque, `node` is the next adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed.**
