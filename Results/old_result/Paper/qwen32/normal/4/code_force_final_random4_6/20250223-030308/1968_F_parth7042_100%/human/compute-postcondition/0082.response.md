The code snippet `a = [0] * (n + 1)` reassigns the list `a` to a new list containing `n + 1` zeros. This means that all the previous values stored in `a` are discarded, and `a` now holds `n + 1` zeros.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `data`, `index`, `pf`, `mp`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `5 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i` and all other elements are 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'.**
