The loop head condition is `2 ** i <= x`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `x` accordingly.

1. **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `2 ** i` must be less than or equal to `x`. Since `i` is already 2, the next value of `i` that we should consider is `i = 3` (since `i` is incremented in each iteration).

2. **Variable `x`:** The value of `x` must be such that `2 ** i <= x`. Given `i` is now 3, `2 ** 3` equals 8. Therefore, `x` must be at least 8 for the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted because only `i` and `x` are involved in the loop head condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is at least 8; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1` if `i` is not 0; `i` is 3**
