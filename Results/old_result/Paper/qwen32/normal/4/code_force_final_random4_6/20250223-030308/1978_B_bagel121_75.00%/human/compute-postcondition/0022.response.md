Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `k` is determined to be the smaller of the two values: `b - a + 1` and `n`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) retain their initial values.
