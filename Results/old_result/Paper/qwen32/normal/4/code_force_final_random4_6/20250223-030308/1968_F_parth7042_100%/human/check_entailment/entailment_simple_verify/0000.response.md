### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness based on the provided problem description, code, and annotations.

#### Problem Breakdown
The task is to determine if a subarray can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of all elements in each part is equal. The program reads multiple test cases, each containing an array and a series of queries. For each query, it determines if the specified subarray is "interesting" based on the XOR criteria.

#### Key Steps in the Program

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation (`pf` array)**:
   - The program calculates a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element.
   - This allows for efficient computation of the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r+1]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values (`mp` dictionary)**:
   - A dictionary `mp` maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.
   - This helps in quickly identifying potential split points.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If this XOR value is `0`, the subarray is trivially "interesting" because it can be split into any number of parts, each with XOR `0`.
   - If the XOR value is not `0`, the program checks if there are indices in the prefix XOR array that allow for a valid split.

4. **Checking Valid Splits**:
   - The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find indices in the prefix XOR array that can serve as valid split points.
   - If such indices exist, the subarray is considered "interesting".

#### Annotations and Validation

The annotations confirm that:
- `pf[i]` correctly computes the XOR of elements from the start of the array up to the `i`-th element.
- `mp[pf[i]]` correctly stores the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
- The program correctly calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
- The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to find valid split points efficiently.

#### Example Validation

Let's consider the provided example:

**Input:**
```

5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5

```

**Output:**
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
