The code snippet modifies the variable `sp` by adding the value of `a[s]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `2 * a[b]` if `a[b]` is non-negative, otherwise `bm` is `0`, `sm` is `4 * a[s]`, `sp` is `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`.**

In natural language: The value of `sp` is now `3 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `4 * a[s]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
