Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999; `n` must be at least 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `p` is the element at index `i` in `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
