The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` compares the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t`. If they are not equal, it increments `cnt` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a string input by the user
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `s` is a string input by the user
- `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`
- `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`
- `cnt` is 0
- `i` is 0

After executing the code snippet, `cnt` will be incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a string input by the user; `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is a string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`; `cnt` is 1 if `s[0] != t[0]` else `cnt` is 0; `i` is 0**
