Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where `s` has been updated to the new input value, `count` is 0, `flag` is 0.**

In simple terms, the variable `flag` has been set to 0. The values of `t`, `s`, and `count` remain unchanged.
