The code snippet calculates a new value for `cost` based on the given formula. The variables `m`, `n`, `N`, and the formula itself are used to determine the new value of `cost`. The other variables (`t`, `L`, `k`, `M`, and the original `cost`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `M` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**

In natural language: The value of `cost` is recalculated to be `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
