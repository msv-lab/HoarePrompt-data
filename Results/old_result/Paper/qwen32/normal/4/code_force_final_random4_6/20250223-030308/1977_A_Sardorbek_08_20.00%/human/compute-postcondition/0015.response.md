Postcondition: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `b` is the first input integer, `c` is the second input integer, `b` is not equal to `c`, and `q` is the tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` is less than `c`, then no additional changes are made to `a`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `a` has the same parity as `b` if `a % 2 == b % 2`; otherwise, `a % 2` is not equal to `b % 2`.**
