The code snippet modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given that `i` is 2, we can calculate the new value of `res` as follows:

1. Calculate `(i + 1)`: This is `2 + 1 = 3`.
2. Calculate `(2 * i + 1)`: This is `2 * 2 + 1 = 5`.
3. Multiply the two results: `3 * 5 = 15`.
4. Add this to the current value of `res`: `6 + 15 = 21`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `mat` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 21, `i` is 2**.
