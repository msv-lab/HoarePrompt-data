Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input, `a` is less than `b`, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`**

In simple terms, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`. The new variable `ans` is calculated based on the formula provided, which involves the values of `b` and `k`.
