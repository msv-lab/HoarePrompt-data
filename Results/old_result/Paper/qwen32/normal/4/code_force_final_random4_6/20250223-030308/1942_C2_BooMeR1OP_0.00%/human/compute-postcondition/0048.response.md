The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` modifies the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to it. The values of `gaps`, `pairs`, and the condition `y < pairs` remain unchanged.

Given that `ans` was initially `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, after the execution of the code, `ans` becomes `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true + 2 * y`.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true + 2 * y`, `gaps` is a non-empty sorted list, e.g., `[1]`, `pairs` is `0`, and `y` is less than `pairs`.**
