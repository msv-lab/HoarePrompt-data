Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is the last index reached before the loop ended, and `ans` is either 0 or 1 indicating whether there are differences between consecutive elements in `s`. If `ans` is 1, there are differences between consecutive elements in `s`. If `ans` is 0, there are no differences between consecutive elements in `s`.**
