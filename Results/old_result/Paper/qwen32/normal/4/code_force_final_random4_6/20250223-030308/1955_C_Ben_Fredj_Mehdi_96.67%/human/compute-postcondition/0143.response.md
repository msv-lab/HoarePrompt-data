In the given code snippet, the `print` statement is `print('8')`. This statement explicitly prints the string `'8'`.

The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `z`) and their relationships, but these variables are not used in the provided `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of these variables and simply outputs the string `'8'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **8**
