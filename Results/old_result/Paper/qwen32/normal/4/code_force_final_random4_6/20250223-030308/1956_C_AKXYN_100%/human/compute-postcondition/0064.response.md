Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: Must be greater than or equal to 1 (though it is not directly used in the provided code snippet).
2. **`n`**: An input integer.
3. **`mat`**: A list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`. (This variable is not used in the provided code snippet).
4. **`res`**: The sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \cdot (2i + 1)\). (This variable is not used in the provided code snippet).
5. **`i`**: Set to \(n-2\).

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`'2 %d' % i`**:
   - This part of the code uses string formatting to insert the value of `i` into the string.
   - Since `i` is \(n-2\), this will be replaced with the value of \(n-2\).

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this range into individual arguments for the `print` function.
   - Therefore, this will print all integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Combining the Parts:
- The first part of the output will be the string `'2 '` followed by the value of \(n-2\).
- The second part will be the integers from 1 to `n` printed sequentially.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- The string `'2 '` followed by the value of \(n-2\).
- Followed by the integers from 1 to `n`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... [n] (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and [n] is the value of n)**

For example, if `n` is 5, then `i` would be \(5-2 = 3\), and the output would be:
Output: **2 3 1 2 3 4 5**
