The value of `k` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order, `x` is `a[f + 1]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`.**
