To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables `temp` and `ans` are updated.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
    - `temp` is initialized to `-1`.
    - `ans` is an empty list.
    - `n` and `m` are assigned values read from the input.
    - `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input list.
    - `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input list in descending order.

2. **Loop Execution**:
    - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
    - For each `i`:
        - If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, it sets `temp` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
        - Otherwise, it appends `abs(a[i] - b[i])` to `ans`.

3. **Final Output State**:
    - The loop will iterate through all `n` elements unless the `break` condition is met before that.
    - If the `break` condition is never met, `temp` will remain `-1` and `ans` will contain the absolute differences for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
    - If the `break` condition is met at any point, `temp` will be set to the index `i` where the condition was met, and `ans` will contain the absolute differences up to but not including that index.

### Final Output State in Natural Language:
After the loop finishes executing all iterations, `temp` will be `-1` if the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is never met for any `i`. Otherwise, `temp` will be the index `i` where this condition first becomes true, and the loop will terminate early. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to and including the index where the loop terminated (or for all `i` if the loop runs to completion).

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`temp` is the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, or `-1` if it never becomes true; `ans` is a list of the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to and including the index where the loop terminated (or for all `i` if the loop runs to completion).**
