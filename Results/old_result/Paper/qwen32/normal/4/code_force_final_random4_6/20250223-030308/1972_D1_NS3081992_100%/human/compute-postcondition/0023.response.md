Functionality: **The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d` (a dictionary with integer keys and list of integers as values), `processing` (a list of integers), `da` (an integer), and `rank` (a list of integers). The function returns 1 if a certain condition is met. Otherwise, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value obtained by recursively calling `func_12` with `d`, `processing`, each element `di` in `d[da]` (where `processing[di - 1]` is 0), and `rank`.**
