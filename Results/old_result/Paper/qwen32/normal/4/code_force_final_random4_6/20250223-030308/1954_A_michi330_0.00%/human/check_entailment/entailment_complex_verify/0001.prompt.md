You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50) where n is the number of parts of the ribbon, m is the number of colors, and k is the number of parts Bob can repaint.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: `itest` is `t-1`, `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, the program has printed either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case have been read from the input and are not altered by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It then determines if it is possible to repaint up to `k` parts of a ribbon consisting of `n` parts to make all parts the same color, given `m` colors. It prints 'YES' if it is possible, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that Alice and Bob are painting a ribbon of `n` parts using `m` colors. Bob can repaint up to `k` parts to make all parts the same color. Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

For Alice to achieve her goal:
- She must paint the ribbon in such a way that no single color can dominate even after Bob repainted up to `k` parts.

### Key Observations

1. **Single Color Case (`m = 1`)**: If there is only one color, Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is `NO`.

2. **Small Ribbon or Few Colors (`n <= k` or `n / m <= k`)**: If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color. Similarly, if the number of parts `n` divided by the number of colors `m` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color. In both cases, the answer is `NO`.

3. **General Case**: If `n > k` and `n / m > k`, Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no single color can dominate even after Bob repainted `k` parts. This is because there will always be a color that is not frequent enough to be completely repainted by Bob. Therefore, the answer is `YES`.

### Program Analysis

The given program uses these observations to determine the answer:

- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
- It checks the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`:
  - If either condition is true, it prints `NO`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `YES`.

### Correctness Verification

- **Single Color Case (`m = 1`)**: The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` simplifies to `n - n < k` which is always false. However, the condition `n <= k` will correctly identify this case and print `NO`.

- **Small Ribbon or Few Colors (`n <= k` or `n / m <= k`)**: The condition `n <= k` directly covers the case where Bob can repaint all parts. The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` ensures that Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color if the parts are distributed among multiple colors.

- **General Case**: If neither of the conditions `n <= k` nor `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true, the program correctly prints `YES`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
