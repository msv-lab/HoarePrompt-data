The `print('1')` statement in the given Python code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The string `'1'` is explicitly provided as the argument to the `print` function.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `a[0]`) and their values or conditions.
- However, the `print` statement is simply `print('1')`, which means it will output the string `'1'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1**
