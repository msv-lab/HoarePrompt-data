### Reasoning:

The given Python program aims to solve the problem by performing up to 2 swaps on the permutation array before applying a binary search algorithm. The binary search will be able to find the number `x` if the array is arranged properly.

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the permutation array and the number `x` to find. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to 0 and `n` respectively.
   - It performs a binary search to find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= x`.

2. **Check and Swap:**
   - After the binary search, it checks if `l` is the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `l` is not the index of `x`, it prints `1` and returns the indices of `l` and `x` to be swapped.
   - If `l` is already the index of `x`, it prints `0` indicating no swap is needed.

However, the problem requires that after performing up to 2 swaps, the binary search should correctly identify `x` at position `l`. The current implementation only checks if `x` is at the correct position `l` after the first swap and does not ensure that the array can be sorted with at most 2 swaps to satisfy the binary search condition for any `x`.

The provided code does not guarantee that the array can be sorted with at most 2 swaps to make the binary search find `x`. It only handles the case where `x` is not at the correct position `l` after the first swap. It does not account for cases where more complex rearrangements are needed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. The solution should ensure that the array can be sorted with at most 2 swaps to make the binary search find `x` correctly.

**Correctness: False**
