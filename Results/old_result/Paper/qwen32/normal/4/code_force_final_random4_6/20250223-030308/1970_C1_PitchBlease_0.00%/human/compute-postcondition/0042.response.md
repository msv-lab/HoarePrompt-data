Postcondition: **`queue` has one less element, `visited` contains all reachable nodes, `current` is the node that was just removed from the queue, `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance from `start` to `current`. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues execution.**
