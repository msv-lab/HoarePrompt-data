The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to adjust only this variable for the loop to execute one more time. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the number of iterations completed, which is less than `t` since the loop has just ended. To execute one more iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, we adjust `i` to `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is the number of iterations completed (min(n, number of iterations until `k` becomes 0)) + 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `n - i` if `k` did not reach 0 within `n` iterations, or 0 if `k` reached 0; `b` is updated `i` times to `p[b] - 1`; `s` is updated `i` times to `p[s] - 1`; `p`, `a` remain unchanged; `bm` is updated `i` times to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated `i` times to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for `i` iterations; `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for `i` iterations. After the if-else block, `bm` is either less than `sm` or greater than or equal to `sm`.**
