The code snippet assigns the value of `p3` to the variable `y`. No other variables are modified by this code. The conditions and constraints on the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `x` is 0; `y` is `p3`.**
