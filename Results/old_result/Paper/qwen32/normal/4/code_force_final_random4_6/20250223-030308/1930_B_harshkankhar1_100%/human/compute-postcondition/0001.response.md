The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at even indices of the list `a`. 

Initial State: 
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` is the length of the permutation `p`, and `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n.

Impact of the code:
- The elements at even indices of `a` are reversed. This means that if `a` was `[a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, ...]`, it will be transformed into `[a2, a1, a0, a5, a4, a3, ...]` after the operation.

Output State: **Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation p. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to n, with the elements at even indices reversed.**

In simpler terms, the list `a` for each test case will have its even-indexed elements reversed, while the odd-indexed elements remain unchanged.
