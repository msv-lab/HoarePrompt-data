The code assigns `ans1` the value of `a * n`. Since `n` is the first integer from the input and `a` is the second integer from the input, `ans1` is now equal to the product of `a` and `n`. The other variables (`t`, `b`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, `ans1` is `a * n`. If `n` > 1, then `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `ans2` is not defined.**
