The code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**
