### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Operations Explanation**:
   - You can exchange any `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of cards left in your hand after performing any number of operations.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - For each unique number in the hand, the optimal strategy involves reducing the count of that number modulo `k`. This is because each operation reduces the count of a particular number by `1` (from `k` to `k-1`).
   - If the total count of cards modulo `k` is zero, it means you can potentially reduce the hand to `k-1` cards by performing operations until only one set of `k` cards remains, which can be reduced to `k-1`.
   - If the total count of cards modulo `k` is not zero, the minimum number of cards left is the sum of these remainders.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Special Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: `k > n`
     - No operations can be performed because there aren't enough cards to form a group of `k`.
     - The program correctly prints `n` in this case.
   - **Case 2**: `k == n`
     - You can perform exactly one operation and exchange all `k` cards for `k-1` cards.
     - The program correctly prints `k-1` in this case.

2. **General Case**:
   - The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to create a frequency table where each unique number's frequency is capped at `k`.
   - The program then checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k-1`; otherwise, it prints `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function creates a frequency table but truncates the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`.
   - The truncation does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

#### Issues with the Program:
- The program incorrectly assumes that if `k` is in the frequency table values, the result should be `k-1`.
- It does not correctly calculate the sum of the remainders when each unique number's frequency is divided by `k`.
- The program does not handle the general case correctly, as it fails to sum the remainders and determine the minimum number of cards left.

#### Correct Approach:
- For each unique number, calculate the remainder of its frequency when divided by `k`.
- Sum these remainders.
- If the sum is zero, the result should be `k-1` (if it's possible to perform operations to reach this state).
- Otherwise, the result should be the sum of the remainders.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to implement the correct logic for determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

**Final: False**
