The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `x - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.

State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input with `x` greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x` (since `i` was `x - 1` and we increment it by 1); `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`; `k` is greater than 0. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is not updated.**
