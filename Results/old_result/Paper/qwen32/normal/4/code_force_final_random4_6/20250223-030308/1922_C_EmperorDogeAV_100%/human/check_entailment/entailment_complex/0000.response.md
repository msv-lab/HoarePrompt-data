### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities based on the given rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates `cities`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.
   - The coordinates of the cities are converted from strings to integers.

2. **Determining Closest Cities:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to determine whether the closest city for each city (except the first one) is the next city or not.
   - The function iterates over the list of cities and calculates the distance to the next and previous cities.
   - If the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, it records `1` in the `prog_cities` list; otherwise, it records the distance to the next city.
   - This is done twice: once for the original list of cities (`forward_cities`) and once for the reversed list of cities (`backward_cities`).

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` to efficiently compute the cumulative cost of traveling from one city to another using the closest city rule.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost for traveling forward, and `pref_sum_b` stores the cumulative cost for traveling backward.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, the program determines whether the destination city is ahead or behind the starting city.
   - If the destination city is ahead, it uses `pref_sum_f` to calculate the cost; otherwise, it uses `pref_sum_b`.
   - The cost is computed as the difference between the prefix sums at the destination and starting indices.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities:**
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if the closest city for each city (except the first one) is the next city or not. However, the implementation is incorrect because it only checks if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city and assigns `1` if true, otherwise it assigns the distance to the next city. This does not correctly determine the closest city; it should instead assign the index of the closest city.
  - Additionally, the function does not handle the first city correctly, as it does not have a previous city to compare with.

- **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect values from `func_1`. This means that the prefix sums do not represent the actual costs of traveling between cities using the closest city rule.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the implementation of `func_1` and the incorrect calculation of prefix sums, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities.

**Correctness: False**
