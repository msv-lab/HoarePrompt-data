Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is '', `ans` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, and the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0.**
