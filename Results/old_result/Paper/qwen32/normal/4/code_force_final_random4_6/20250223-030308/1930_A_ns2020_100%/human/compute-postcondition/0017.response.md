Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 4999. This variable seems to be a constraint but is not used in the provided code snippet.
2. `n` is the new input integer.
3. `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7. This list is also not used in the provided code snippet.
4. `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Explanation:
- `A[::2]` is a slicing operation that selects every second element from the list `A` starting from the first element (index 0).
- `sum(A[::2])` calculates the sum of these selected elements.

### Output:
The code prints the sum of every second element in the sorted list `A` starting from the first element.

Since the exact elements of the list `A` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **sum of every second element in the sorted list `A` starting from the first element**
