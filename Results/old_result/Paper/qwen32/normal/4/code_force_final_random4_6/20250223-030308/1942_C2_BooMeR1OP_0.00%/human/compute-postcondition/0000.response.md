The code provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state specifies the ranges and constraints for these variables, and the code directly modifies their values based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned values from the input.**

In simpler terms, after executing the code, `t` remains unchanged, and `n`, `x`, and `y` are set to the values provided in the input.
