Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Here are the main issues:

1. **Special Case Handling**: The function `func_2` includes a special case handling for `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which returns `0` regardless of the array elements. This is incorrect and does not generalize to all test cases.
2. **Optimal Removal Strategy**: Alice should remove the `k` smallest elements to maximize the sum after Bob's turn. The current implementation does not always remove the smallest elements.
3. **Optimal Negation Strategy**: Bob should negate the `x` smallest elements among the remaining ones to minimize the sum. The current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario, especially when `negatives` exceeds the number of remaining elements.
4. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation in the loop is not correctly adjusted when Alice removes elements and Bob negates elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob negates x smallest elements among the remaining ones
        a.sort()
        for j in range(min(x, len(a))):
            a[j] = -a[j]
        
        print(sum(a))

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

This version of the program correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob:
- Alice removes the `k` smallest elements.
- Bob negates the `x` smallest elements among the remaining ones.
- The final sum is computed and printed for each test case.
