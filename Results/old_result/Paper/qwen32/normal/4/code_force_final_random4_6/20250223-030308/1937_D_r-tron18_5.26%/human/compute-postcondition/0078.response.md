To determine the new output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and how it modifies the existing variables. Here is the provided code snippet again for reference:

```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

Let's break down the changes:

1. **zeroInd**: The value of `zeroInd` is recalculated using the function `func_1`. The new value of `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`.

2. **suffZero**: The value of `suffZero` was previously defined based on the value of `el` and other conditions. However, it is not modified in this code snippet, so it remains the same.

3. **ol (totalOne)**: The value of `ol` (which is the same as `totalOne`) is not modified in this code snippet, so it remains the same.

4. **Other Variables**: The values of other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `el`, `zr`, `oneInd`, `fi`) are not modified in this code snippet, so they remain the same.

### Output State:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list defined based on the value of `el` and other conditions; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `el` is `s1[n - 3]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `oneInd` is calculated differently based on conditions involving `ol` and `zr`; `fi` is calculated based on conditions involving `preOne`, `zr`, and `ol` if `el` is '>'; `ans[i]` is calculated based on the conditions involving `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` if `el` is '>', or based on conditions involving `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `suffZero` if `el` is '<'.**

In simpler terms, the value of `zeroInd` has been updated, and all other variables remain unchanged.
