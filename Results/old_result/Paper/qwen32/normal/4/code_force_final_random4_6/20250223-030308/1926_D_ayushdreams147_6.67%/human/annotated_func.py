#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: `res` is the number of unique numbers in `a` that do not have a corresponding flipped number, and `count` contains flipped versions of numbers that appear an odd number of times, each with a count of 1.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the number of unique numbers in `a` that do not have a corresponding flipped number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and 2^31 - 1. It returns the count of unique numbers in `a` that do not have their bitwise flipped versions also present in the list.
