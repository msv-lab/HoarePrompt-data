The code snippet initializes an empty list `x`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, but this variable is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the list `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases; `x` is an empty list.**
