The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used inside the loop. The loop will execute `t` times, and the state of `t` needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1. Since the loop iterates `t` times, after each iteration, `t` is implicitly decremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the loop head).

To execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Since `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 more than it is at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then no change is made to `a` or `b`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is either at least `n` or less than `n`.**
