The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides various variables and conditions, but none of them affect the output of this specific `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `slength`, `tests`, and `x`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
