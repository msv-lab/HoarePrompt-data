To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and `len(ar)`.

The `while` loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1
- `i` is 3
- If `ar[i-1]` equals `num`, then `same` is 2; otherwise, `same` is 1 and `num` is updated to `ar[i]`
- `minn` is 1 if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `minn` remains `inf`

The only variable we can adjust in the loop head is `i`. Since `i` is currently 3, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(ar)` for the loop to execute again. Given that `ar` has a length greater than 1, the smallest possible length of `ar` is 2, but since `i` is 3, `ar` must have a length greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Thus, we need to adjust `len(ar)` to be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is 3**
