Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. The condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect. If `b < c`, it should print 'NO' because Nikita can't end up with more cubes than the total number of moves he makes.

2. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect and irrelevant. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not the number of moves. This condition should be checking if the difference between `b` and `c` is even, because the only way to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves is if the difference between `n` and `m` is even (since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, and an even number of such changes is required to reach an exact number of cubes).

3. The output should be consistent in case (either all uppercase or all lowercase).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version correctly checks if the number of moves `b` is at least the number of cubes `c` and if the difference `b - c` is even, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for the problem.
