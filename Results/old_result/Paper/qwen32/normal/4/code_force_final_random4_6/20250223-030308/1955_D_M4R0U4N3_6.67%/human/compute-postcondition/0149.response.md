The provided Python code snippet is `extra = set()`. This line reassigns the `extra` variable to a new empty set, discarding any previous contents of `extra`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `extra` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is an empty set; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.**
