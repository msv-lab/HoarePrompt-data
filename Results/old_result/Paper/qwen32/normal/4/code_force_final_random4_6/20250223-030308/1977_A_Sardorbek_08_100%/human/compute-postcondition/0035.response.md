Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` and `c` are the new integers from the input, `q` is the tuple `(b, c)` after the input, and `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `b < c`, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is checked, and regardless of whether it is true or false, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
