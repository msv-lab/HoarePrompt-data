You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, prints the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers and twice the value of `n`, and then prints `2n` lines. Each pair of lines consists of a sequence starting with `1` and `2`, followed by the current index `i` and the sequence `n, n-1, ..., 2, 1`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: The sum of all elements in the matrix should be maximized. The maximum possible sum can be achieved by filling each row and column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]. This permutation ensures that the highest possible numbers are placed in the matrix, thus maximizing the sum.
2. **Operations**: The problem allows up to \( 2n \) operations. Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, we can fill each row and each column once, using exactly \( 2n \) operations.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows this strategy:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
2. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix, which is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \). This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and their permutations.
3. **Operations**: The program then outputs \( 2n \) operations, where the first \( n \) operations fill each row with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], and the next \( n \) operations fill each column with the same permutation.

### Verification:
- **Sum Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the sum is correct for the maximum sum achievable with the described operations.
- **Operations**: The operations specified are valid and ensure that each row and column is filled with the highest possible permutation, thus achieving the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
