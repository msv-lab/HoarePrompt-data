Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of n-1 pairs of integers (u, v) representing the edges of the tree (where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n), and a single integer `u_1` representing the starting node of the stone (where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). The function returns a list `numbers` containing n-1 elements, where each element is a pair of integers [num1, num2] representing the edges of the tree.**
