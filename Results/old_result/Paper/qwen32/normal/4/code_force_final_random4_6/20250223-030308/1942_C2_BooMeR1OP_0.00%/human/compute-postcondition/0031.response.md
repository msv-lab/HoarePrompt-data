The code snippet provided recalculates the value of `next_elem` using the same formula it was initially defined with. This means the value of `next_elem` remains the same unless the underlying variables `a`, `i`, `x`, and `n` change, which they do not in this snippet. Therefore, the state of `next_elem` does not change. The other variables remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, `gaps` is either an empty list or a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**
