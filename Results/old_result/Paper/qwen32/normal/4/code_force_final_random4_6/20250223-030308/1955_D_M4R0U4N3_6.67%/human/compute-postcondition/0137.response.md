The code snippet `done.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `done`. 

Given the initial state, `r` is `m + 2`, so `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`. This element is added to the set `done`.

The values of `t`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `j`, `r`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, `todo`, and `ans` are not changed except for `done`, which now includes `a[m + 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `k` is the integer provided by the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `j` is `m-1`, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[2]` and is not in `extra`. If `old` was in `extra`, the state remains unchanged. If `old` was in `done`, it is now removed from `done` and included in `todo`. If the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 3. If `old` was not in `done`, `ans` and `todo` remain unchanged. The element `a[r]` is removed from `todo`. `done` includes `a[m + 2]`.**
