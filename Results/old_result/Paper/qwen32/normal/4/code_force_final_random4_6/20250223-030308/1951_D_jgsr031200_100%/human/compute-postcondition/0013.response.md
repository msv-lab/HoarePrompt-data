The provided code snippet is `curr = n // i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming the task is to provide the state after executing the line, we need to consider `i` as an undefined variable. Since `i` is not defined, we cannot compute a specific value for `curr`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `curr` which will hold the result of `n // i` once `i` is defined.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is 0; `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is an undefined variable.**
