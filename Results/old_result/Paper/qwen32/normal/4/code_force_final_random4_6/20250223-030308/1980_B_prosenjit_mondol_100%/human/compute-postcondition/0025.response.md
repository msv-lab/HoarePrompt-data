Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999 (This variable is not used in the given print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 2.
- `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 2.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in the list `a`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable `k` and `n` Relationship:**
   - `k` is the third integer from the input minus 2.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - The condition `k == n - 1` checks if the third input integer minus 2 is equal to the first input integer minus 1.

2. **Variable `x` and `a[k + 1]`:**
   - `x` is the element at index `f` in the list `a`.
   - `a[k + 1]` is the element at index `k + 1` in the list `a`.
   - The condition `a[k + 1] < x` checks if the element at index `k + 1` in the list `a` is less than the element at index `f` in the list `a`.

### Output Determination:
The `print` statement checks two conditions:
- If `k == n - 1`, it prints `'YES'`.
- Otherwise, if `a[k + 1] < x`, it prints `'YES'`.
- If neither condition is met, it prints `'MAYBE'`.

### Final Output:
The output will depend on the values of `n`, `f`, `k`, and the elements in the list `a`. Since the exact values of these variables are not provided, we can only describe the conditions under which each output is produced.

Output: **'YES' if `k == n - 1` or `a[k + 1] < x`, otherwise 'MAYBE'**
