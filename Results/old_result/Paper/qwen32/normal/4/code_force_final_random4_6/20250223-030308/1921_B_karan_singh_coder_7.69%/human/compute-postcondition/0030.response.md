The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a new string input by the user
- `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `s` is the new string input by the user
- `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`
- `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`
- `cnt` is 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0
- `i` is 0
- If the count of '1's in the new `s` is equal to the count of '1's in the new `t`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between the new `s1` and `t1`.

After executing the code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]`:
- `cnt` will be incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`. Otherwise, it will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a new string input by the user; `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `s` is the new string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`; `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0; `i` is 0; if the count of '1's in the new `s` is equal to the count of '1's in the new `t`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between the new `s1` and `t1`.**
