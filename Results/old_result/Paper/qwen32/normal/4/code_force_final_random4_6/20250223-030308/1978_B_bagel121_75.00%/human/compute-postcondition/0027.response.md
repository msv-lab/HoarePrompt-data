Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, with `t` being the number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, computes `ans` as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` as `(n - k) * a`, then prints `ans + p2`. After all iterations, `t` test cases have been processed and their respective results printed.**

In simpler terms, the program has gone through all `t` test cases, processing each one by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`, and then printing the result based on the conditions provided. All test cases have been handled, and the program is finished executing.
