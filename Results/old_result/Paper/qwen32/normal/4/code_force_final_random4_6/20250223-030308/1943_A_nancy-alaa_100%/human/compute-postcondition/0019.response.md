Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input line and converting each split component to an integer; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but the loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
