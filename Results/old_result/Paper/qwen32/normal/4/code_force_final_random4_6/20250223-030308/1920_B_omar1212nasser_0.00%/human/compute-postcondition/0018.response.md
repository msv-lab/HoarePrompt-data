The code appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. The values of `removals`, `i`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged according to the given initial state description. 

Given the initial state:
- `removals` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `s` is `s - elements[-i]`.
- `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if indices are within bounds, otherwise `n` is 0.

The new value to be appended to `pos` is `s - 2 * n`.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `s - elements[-i]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if indices are within bounds, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` includes the new value `s - 2 * n`.**
