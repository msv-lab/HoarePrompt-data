Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `T` is non-zero and has been decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r] == 0`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` remains unchanged. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are decremented by `mi`. If `a[l] == 0`, `l` is set to 1; otherwise, `l` remains 0. If `a[r] == 0`, `r` is set to `n - 2`; otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1`. If `mi * 2 > k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
