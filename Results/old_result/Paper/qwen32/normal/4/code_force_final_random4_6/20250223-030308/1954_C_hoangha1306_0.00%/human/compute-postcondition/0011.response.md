Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and must have a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `kq1` is the character at index `i` of `a`; `kq2` is the character at index `i` of `a`; `vt` is 0; `i` is 0; the current character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the current character at index `i` of `b`.**

The `continue` statement does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
