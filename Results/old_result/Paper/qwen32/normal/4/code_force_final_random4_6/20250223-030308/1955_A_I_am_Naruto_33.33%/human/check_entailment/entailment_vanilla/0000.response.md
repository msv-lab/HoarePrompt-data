Let's analyze the given Python program step by step based on the problem description provided.

### Problem Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price for one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts is `b` burles.
- The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Key Points:
1. **Single Yogurt Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - If Maxim needs only one yogurt, the cost is simply `a` burles.
   
2. **Multiple Yogurts Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - If Maxim buys all yogurts at the regular price, the total cost is `a * n`.
   - If Maxim buys yogurts in pairs, he can buy `n // 2` pairs and possibly one extra yogurt if `n` is odd.
   - The cost for buying `n // 2` pairs is `b * (n // 2)`.
   - If `n` is odd, he needs to buy one more yogurt at the regular price, adding `a` burles to the cost.
   - Thus, the total cost for buying yogurts in pairs plus the extra yogurt (if any) is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.

### Program Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the case when `n == 1` by simply printing `a`.
- For `n > 1`, the program calculates the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`) and the cost of buying yogurts in pairs plus any extra yogurt (`ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`).
- The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

### Correctness:
- The logic for both single and multiple yogurt cases is correctly implemented.
- The program handles all edge cases, including when `n` is odd or even, and when buying in pairs is more or less expensive than buying individually.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
