The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `b` and `c`. This means that the values of `b` and `c` are updated based on the input, but the initial values of `k`, `i`, and `a` are not directly affected by this code. The only change is that `b` and `c` now hold the values provided by the user input.

Output State: **`k` is `b`, `i` is `b + 1`, `a` must be greater than `b + 1`, `b` is the first input integer, `c` is the second input integer**.
