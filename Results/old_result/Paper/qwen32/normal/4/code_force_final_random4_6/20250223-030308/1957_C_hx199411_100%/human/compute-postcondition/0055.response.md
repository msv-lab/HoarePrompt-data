The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This overwrites the previous values of `c` and `r` with the new values obtained from the input. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 1 or 2, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**.
