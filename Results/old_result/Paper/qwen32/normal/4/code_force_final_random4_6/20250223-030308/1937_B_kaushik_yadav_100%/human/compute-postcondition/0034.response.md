The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. 

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` will be updated by concatenating `b[i]` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The variable `work` and `i` are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`; `i` and `work` are determined based on the value of `work`**.
