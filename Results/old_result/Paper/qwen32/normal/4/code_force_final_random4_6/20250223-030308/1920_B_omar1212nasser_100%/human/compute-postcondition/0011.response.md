The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `removals`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `removals`. If `i` is less than `removals + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `removals` is greater than 0, `i` is unchanged, and the loop condition is `i` in the range from 1 to `removals + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Let's break it down:
- `removals` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`removals` is greater than 0; `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`; `elements` is unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements` or `negatives + i` is greater than the length of `elements`; `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]` if `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, otherwise `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i]`; `pos` includes a new element `s - 2 * s2`.** 

However, we only adjust the loop head variables:
State: **`removals` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
