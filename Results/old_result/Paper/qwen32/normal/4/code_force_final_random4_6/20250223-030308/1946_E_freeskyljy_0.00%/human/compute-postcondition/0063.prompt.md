Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`; At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `nums_left` is -1; and `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is 1; `i` is `N + 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`; At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `nums_left` is -2; `M2` is greater than 1; `i` is `N`; If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is increased to 2. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * -1 % MOD` and `cur` remains 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`; At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `nums_left` is -3; `M2` is greater than 1; `i` is `N`; If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is increased to 2. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * -1 % MOD` and `cur` remains 1. If `cur` was 1 and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `ans` is further updated to `ans * -2 % MOD`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`; At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `nums_left` is -4; `M2` is greater than 1; `i` is `N`; If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is increased to 2. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * -1 % MOD` and `cur` remains 1. If `cur` was 1 and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `ans` is further updated to `ans * -2 % MOD`. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, `ans` is updated to `ans * -3 % MOD`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
