The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is incremented by 1. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we simply need to increment `_` by 1 again.

State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a > c`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `x` is set to `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is not zero, `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is zero, `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`**

Since only `_` can be adjusted and it is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we increment `_` by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a > c`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `x` is set to `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is not zero, `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is zero, `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`**

To be more precise, if `_` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a > c`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `x` is set to `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is not zero, `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is zero, `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`**

For simplicity, we can just say:

State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a > c`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `x` is set to `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is not zero, `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is zero, `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`**
