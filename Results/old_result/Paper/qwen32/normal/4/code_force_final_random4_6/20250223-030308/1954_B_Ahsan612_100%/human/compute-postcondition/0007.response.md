To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `i < len(ar)`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `same` is 1
- `num` is `ar[0]`
- `minn` is `inf`
- `i` is 1

The loop condition `i < len(ar)` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. Initially, `i` is set to 1, so `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state of `ar` needs to be adjusted to ensure that the length of `ar` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1; `same` is 1; `num` is `ar[0]`; `minn` is `inf`; `i` is 1**
