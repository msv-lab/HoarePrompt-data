The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use). The loop will execute `t` times, and after each iteration, `_` is incremented by 1. 

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2, we need to adjust `_` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` would have been `0` for the first iteration, `1` for the second iteration, and so on. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1.

Thus, if at the end of the previous iteration `_` was `0`, at the start of the next iteration it should be `1`. If `_` was `1`, it should be `2`, and so forth.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input. No change is made to `a` or `b` regardless of whether `b` is less than or equal to `a` or greater than `a`. The difference between `b` and `a` remains either at least `n` or less than `n` if `b` is greater than `a`. `_` is 1**
