Postcondition: **`t` is some value, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user. If `r` equals `'>'`, then `prev` is set to `i`. Otherwise, if `r` equals `'='` and `r2` equals `'<'`, then `prev` is set to the value of `t`. If `r` equals `'='` and `r2` does not equal `'<'`, then `prev` remains 0.**
