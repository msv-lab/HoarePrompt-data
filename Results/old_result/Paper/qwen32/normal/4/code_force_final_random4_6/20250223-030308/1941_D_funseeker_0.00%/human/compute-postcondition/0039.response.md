The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` already contains at least one element based on the initial state, after this operation, `temp` will contain this new element in addition to its previous contents. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0. `ans` is a set containing at least one element. `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '1', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.**
