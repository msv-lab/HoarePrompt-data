The code snippet modifies the variable `last_row` by appending the last character of the last string in the list `a` to it. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list containing two input strings
- `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`
- `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a`
- `i` is 1

After executing the code:
- `last_row` is updated to be the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the first character of the last string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the first string in `a` concatenated with the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is 1**.
