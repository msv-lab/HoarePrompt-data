Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b` and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. After cutting, he can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle is considered different from the original if it is not a 90-degree rotation of it.

### Key Observations:
1. **Odd x Odd Rectangles**: If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearrange them to form a different rectangle. This is because any cut would result in rectangles with at least one even dimension, and rearranging such rectangles to form a different rectangle is not possible without violating the integer side condition.
2. **One Dimension Even**: If at least one dimension is even, the rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearranged to form a different rectangle. For example, a 2x3 rectangle can be cut into two 1x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 3x2 rectangle.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the following conditions:
1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints "NO".
2. If one dimension is exactly half of the other, it prints "NO".
3. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Counterexamples from the Original Assessment:
1. **Rectangle 3x4**:
   - The program prints "YES" because neither dimension is odd and one is not exactly half of the other.
   - This is correct because a 3x4 rectangle can be cut into two 3x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 2x6 rectangle.

2. **Rectangle 5x4**:
   - The program prints "YES" because neither dimension is odd and one is not exactly half of the other.
   - This is correct because a 5x4 rectangle can be cut into two 5x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 2x10 rectangle.

3. **Rectangle 6x3**:
   - The program prints "NO" because one dimension is exactly half of the other.
   - This is incorrect because a 6x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 3x6 rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the second condition (`elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:`). This condition is overly restrictive and incorrectly disallows cases where a rectangle can indeed be rearranged into a different rectangle.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach, as suggested in the original assessment, is to check if at least one of the dimensions is even. If so, it is always possible to form a different rectangle.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is correct in identifying the flaw in the provided program. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
