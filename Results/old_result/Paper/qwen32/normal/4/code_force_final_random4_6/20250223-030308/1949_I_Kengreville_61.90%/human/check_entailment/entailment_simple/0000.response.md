### Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in such a way that disks that were tangent remain tangent, no two disks overlap, and the sum of all radii strictly decreases.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program reads the number of disks and their respective coordinates and radii.
2. **Initialization:** It initializes several lists: `visited` to keep track of visited disks, `coef0` and `coef1` to store coefficients for each disk, and `nodes` to store indices of disks during DFS.
3. **DFS Traversal:** For each unvisited disk, it performs a DFS to find all disks that are tangent to it. During the traversal, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for each disk based on the tangency condition.
4. **Condition Checking:** After the DFS, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the disks in the current component is non-zero. If it finds such a component, it sets `ok` to `True`.
5. **Output:** If `ok` is `True`, it prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to adjust the radii as required. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The core idea is to use the DFS to identify connected components of tangent disks and check if there exists a way to adjust the radii such that the sum decreases. The condition `c1 != 0` is central to this logic, as it indicates that there is a way to adjust the radii within the connected component.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described above. It uses DFS to identify connected components of tangent disks and checks the condition `c1 != 0` to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii. This condition is based on the requirement that the sum of the radii must strictly decrease while maintaining tangency.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the logic appears to be sound. The first example (where the output is "YES") shows a configuration where radii can be adjusted to meet the conditions, and the second example (where the output is "NO") shows a configuration where no such adjustment is possible.

Thus, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
