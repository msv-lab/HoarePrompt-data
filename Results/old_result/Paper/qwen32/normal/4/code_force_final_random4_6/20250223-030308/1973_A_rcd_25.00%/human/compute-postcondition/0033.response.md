The given Python code snippet contains a `print(-1)` statement. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `cur`) and their relationships, but the `print(-1)` statement does not depend on any of these variables directly. Instead, it simply prints the integer `-1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` as integers with specific conditions, but it does not affect the `print(-1)` statement.
2. The `print(-1)` statement is a direct output of the integer `-1` and does not involve any calculations or conditions based on the variables described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print(-1)` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
