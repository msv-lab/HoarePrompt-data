The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `num` was either 1 or 2. Therefore, after the increment, `num` will be either 2 or 3 respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `c`, `r`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 2 or 3, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1**.
