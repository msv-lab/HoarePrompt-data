The code snippet `n = int(input())` changes the value of `n` to whatever integer is provided by the input. The other variables (`j`, `t`, and `sum`) are not directly affected by this input operation. However, their initial definitions are dependent on the initial value of `n`, which has now changed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `j` is an input integer + 1, `t` is t - 1, `sum` is \(\frac{\text{input integer}(\text{input integer}+1)(2 \times \text{input integer}+1)}{6}\)**

In natural language: The value of `n` is now whatever integer was input. The value of `j` is this new value of `n` plus 1. The value of `t` is one less than its previous value. The value of `sum` is recalculated based on the new value of `n` using the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\).
