def func_1():

    #The program returns a string that represents a line of input read from standard input, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a line of input from standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the resulting string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This function does not have any parameters. It implicitly relies on other functions or global variables, which are not specified in the given code snippet.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns the integer value returned by func_1()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the integer value returned by `func_1`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are provided in the function signature of `func_3()`. The function does not have any parameters, and thus, there are no preconditions related to the variables in the function signature.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. These integers are derived from splitting a string returned by `func_1()` and converting each part of the split string to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players such that 2 <= n <= 1000, m is an integer representing the number of throws such that 1 <= m <= 1000, and x is an integer representing the starting player such that 1 <= x <= n.

    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`. `ans` is a set containing all values generated from `x` through the specified operations for `m` iterations. If `0` is in `ans`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is added to `ans`.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of unique elements in the set `ans` after the operations, possibly increased by 1 if `0` was not initially in `ans`)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: elements of `ans` (where `ans` is a set containing all values generated from `x` through the specified operations for `m` iterations, and `n` is added to `ans` if `0` is not in `ans`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the number of unique players who will end up with an item after `m` throws in a circular manner, starting from player `x`. It also prints the list of these unique player numbers. If player number `0` is in the result, it is replaced with player number `n`.
