Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x + 1`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`; otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged. `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `ans1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
