Postcondition: ***`i` is the index at which the loop terminated (`n` or the index where `c` became 2). `ind` is a list of up to two indices of cows with ratings greater than `x` and is not empty. The length of `ind` is 1. `c` is the number of cows with ratings greater than `x` (up to 2) and is greater than 0. The current value of `c` is 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.***
