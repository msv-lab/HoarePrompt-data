Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1` and still greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `s` is the new input string, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each character in the new `s`. If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `2 * m`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `m`. `i` is `'G'`.**
