The code snippet `inds[0].append(0)` modifies the `inds` defaultdict by appending the integer `0` to the list associated with the key `0`. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing a single element `0`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]`.**
