The code `k -= 1` decrements the value of `k` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the input minus 1.**
