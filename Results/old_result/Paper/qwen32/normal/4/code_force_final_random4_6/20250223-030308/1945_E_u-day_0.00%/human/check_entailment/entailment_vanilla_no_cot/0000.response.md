Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, it does not guarantee that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search algorithm will find the target number `x` at the position `l` after the loop ends.

Here are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. The program only performs one swap if necessary, but the problem statement allows for up to two swaps.
2. The logic for finding the position `pos` of `x` and the binary search is correct, but the program does not consider the possibility of making a second swap to further improve the sorted order around `x`.
3. The program checks if `arr[low] == x` after the binary search loop, but it does not handle the case where `arr[low]` is not `x` and a swap is necessary.

To fix the program, a strategy to perform up to two swaps to make `x` reachable at the correct position after the binary search should be implemented. This might involve identifying the correct positions to swap elements to ensure that `x` can be found as `p_l` after the binary search completes.
