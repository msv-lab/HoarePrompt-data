Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `L` is a new list of integers read from the input, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `M` is a new sorted list of integers read from the input, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` excluding the last element, and `cost` is recalculated based on the new values of `L` and `M`.**

Explanation: The variable `N` had its last element removed using `N.pop()`, which means `N` now contains the first `q-1` elements of the sorted list `M`. The other variables remain unchanged.
