Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 2`, `k` is `j + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 2, and `k` is set to `j + 1`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
