The code snippet updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of `num` by 1. If `num` is not already a key in `frequency_table`, it is added with an initial count of 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element; `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1 or set to 1 if `num` was not previously a key in `frequency_table`.**
