Let's break down the given information and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 4999 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.
- `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(sum(A[::2]))
```

### Explanation:
- The code snippet is printing the sum of every second element from the sorted list `A`, starting from the first element (index 0).

### Steps to Determine Output:
1. **Sorting of `A`**: The list `A` is sorted. This means the elements of `A` are in non-decreasing order.
2. **Slicing `A[::2]`**: The slice `A[::2]` means we are taking every second element from the list `A`, starting from index 0. For example, if `A = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, then `A[::2]` would be `[1, 5, 9]`.
3. **Summing the Slice**: The `sum` function is then applied to this sliced list to get the sum of these elements.

### Output:
Given the sorted nature of `A`, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are the smallest elements in the list. The exact sum will depend on the specific values in `A`, but we can describe it precisely based on the precondition.

Output: **sum of elements at even indices in the sorted list `A` (where `A` is a sorted list of integers provided by the new input)**

This output describes the exact nature of what the code will print based on the given information.
