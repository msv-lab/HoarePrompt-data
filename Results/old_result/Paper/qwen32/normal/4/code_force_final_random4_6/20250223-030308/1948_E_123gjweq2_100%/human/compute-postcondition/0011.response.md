The code snippet modifies the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` by setting it to `small_element + i`. 

Given the initial state:
- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `i` is `2`

Thus, `small_element + i` equals `(left + 1) + 2`, which simplifies to `left + 3`.

Therefore, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is now `left + 3`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `i` is 2, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 3`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**
