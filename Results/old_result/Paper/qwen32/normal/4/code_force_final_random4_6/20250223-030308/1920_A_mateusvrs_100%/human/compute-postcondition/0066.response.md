The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and its previous value. If `a` is not equal to 1, then if `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and its original value; otherwise, `cx` includes the value of `x`.**
