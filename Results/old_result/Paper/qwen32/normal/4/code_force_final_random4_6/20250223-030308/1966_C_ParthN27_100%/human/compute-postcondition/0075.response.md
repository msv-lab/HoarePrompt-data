Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we can analyze the context and determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is 1.
- `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of integers provided as input.
- `s` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it.
- `i` is set to `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the value of `i` where the loop breaks.
- `ans` is 1.
- The number of times the difference was `<= 1` is even.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, `ans`) are used in this print statement. Therefore, the output is independent of the values of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **Alice**
