The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that is not used within the loop body. The loop runs for a number of iterations determined by the input value converted to an integer. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop progresses based on the input.

Given that the loop runs for `int(input())` iterations, the state at the start of the next iteration will simply be the iteration count being one more than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs for `int(input())` times.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has completed one of these iterations.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, the iteration count (which is not explicitly stored in a variable but is tracked internally by the loop) must be incremented by 1.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, its specific value does not matter for the loop's execution. The only state that needs to be adjusted is the implicit iteration count, which we can infer from the loop's behavior.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same in terms of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans1`, and `ans2` (if they are calculated). The only change is that the loop is about to start its next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input. If `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is set to `a * n` and `ans2` is set to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. If `n` is equal to 1, no additional variables `ans1` and `ans2` are calculated.**
