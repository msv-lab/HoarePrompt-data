Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. It also receives the binary strings `a` and `b` themselves. The function does not return any value (returns `None`).**
