The code provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `nums`. The initial state mentions that `numbers` is an empty list, but this list is not modified by the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change is to the variable `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is an empty list; `nums` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line.**
