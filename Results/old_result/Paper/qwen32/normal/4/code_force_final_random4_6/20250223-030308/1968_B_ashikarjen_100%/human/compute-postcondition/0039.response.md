Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m` must be greater than 1, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than 2, `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` changes from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged, and all preconditions specified in the initial state are still valid.
