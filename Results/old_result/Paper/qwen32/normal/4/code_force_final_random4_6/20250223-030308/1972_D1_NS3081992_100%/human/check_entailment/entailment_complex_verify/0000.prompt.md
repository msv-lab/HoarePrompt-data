You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_16` prints a series of integers, each on a new line, for a number of times determined by the value returned from `func_10()`. The value printed in each iteration is obtained from `func_15()`. The function does not return any value, and the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The main function responsible for solving the problem is `func_15`, which calculates the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the conditions specified in the problem description. However, the logic within `func_15` is not correct for the given problem.

The condition to be satisfied is that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided function `func_15` uses a loop that iterates up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and counts pairs based on a specific formula, which does not directly address the condition given in the problem.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the first test case provided in the problem description:

- Input: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
- Expected Output: 1 (since the only pair is \((1, 1)\) and \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\))

The function `func_15` will return `0` for this input, which is incorrect.

Let's consider another test case:

- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
- Expected Output: 3 (pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\))

The function `func_15` will not correctly count these pairs.

The logic in `func_15` does not properly iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To make the program correct, we would need to iterate through all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the given condition directly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if the condition is satisfied, ensuring that the output is correct for all cases.
