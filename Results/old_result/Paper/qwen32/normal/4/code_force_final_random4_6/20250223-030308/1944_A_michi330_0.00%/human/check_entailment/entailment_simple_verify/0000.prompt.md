You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.

            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: The output is a sequence of `t` numbers, where each number is either `1` or `n - 1` based on the condition `k >= n - 1` for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness according to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Initial Setup**: There are `n` islands, and every pair of islands is connected by a bridge, resulting in a total of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) bridges.
- **Objective**: Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach starting from island 1.
- **Output**: For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit.

### Program Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
```

### Logic Evaluation
1. **Case 1: \( k \geq n - 1 \)**
   - If Dominater can destroy at least as many bridges as there are connections to island 1 (i.e., \( n - 1 \) bridges), then Everule can only stay on island 1. This is because all direct connections to island 1 will be destroyed, making it impossible to reach any other island.
   - **Output**: `1`
   
2. **Case 2: \( k < n - 1 \)**
   - If Dominater destroys fewer than \( n - 1 \) bridges, there will still be at least one bridge connecting island 1 to some other island. This means Everule can reach all islands except possibly a few that might be disconnected from the rest due to the destruction of other bridges. However, the problem does not specify that Dominater must disconnect the entire graph beyond island 1; it only specifies minimizing the number of reachable islands. Thus, the best Dominater can do is disconnect all but one island directly from island 1.
   - **Output**: `n - 1`

### Testing the Program
Let's check the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `2 0`
   - Output: `1` (incorrect, should be `2` because no bridges are destroyed, so Everule can reach both islands)
   
2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Output: `1` (correct, one bridge is destroyed, so Everule can only stay on island 1)
   
3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `4 1`
   - Output: `3` (incorrect, should be `4` because destroying one bridge cannot disconnect all islands from island 1)
   
4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 10`
   - Output: `1` (correct, more than enough bridges are destroyed to disconnect all islands from island 1)
   
5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `5 3`
   - Output: `4` (incorrect, should be `5` because destroying three bridges cannot disconnect all islands from island 1)
   
6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `4 4`
   - Output: `1` (correct, more than enough bridges are destroyed to disconnect all islands from island 1)

### Conclusion
The program fails for cases where \( k < n - 1 \) because it incorrectly outputs `n - 1` instead of the correct number of reachable islands. The logic in the program does not account for the scenario where fewer than \( n - 1 \) bridges are destroyed, leading to incorrect results.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation of Incorrectness
- The program does not handle the case where \( k < n - 1 \) correctly. It should calculate the exact number of reachable islands based on the optimal destruction of bridges, which is more complex than simply checking if \( k \geq n - 1 \).
