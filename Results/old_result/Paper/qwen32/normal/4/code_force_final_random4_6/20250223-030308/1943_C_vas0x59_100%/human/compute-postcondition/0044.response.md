Postcondition: **`u2vs` remains unchanged as it is a list of adjacency lists representing the tree; `d` remains unchanged as it is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices; `a` remains unchanged as it is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` remains unchanged as it is the list of previous vertices for the shortest path tree; `b` remains unchanged as it is also the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order with an odd length; `ops` is an empty list.`**
