Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Here are the key issues:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should remove the `k` largest elements to maximize the sum.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: After Alice's move, Bob should flip the `x` smallest elements to minimize the sum.

The current implementation incorrectly calculates the sum by not considering the optimal removal and flipping strategies. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes the k largest elements
        if k >= n:
            print(0)
            continue
        a = a[:n-k]
        
        # Bob flips the x smallest elements
        flips = min(x, len(a))
        for i in range(flips):
            a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        print(sum(a))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Alice's Move**: The array is sorted in ascending order, and the `k` largest elements are removed by slicing the array to `a[:n-k]`.
2. **Bob's Move**: The `x` smallest elements in the remaining array are flipped to negative.
3. **Final Sum**: The sum of the modified array is computed and printed.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally according to the problem's rules.
