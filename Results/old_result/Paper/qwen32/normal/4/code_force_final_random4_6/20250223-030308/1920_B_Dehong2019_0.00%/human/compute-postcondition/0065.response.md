The code snippet assigns the sum of all elements in the list `a` to the variable `ans1`. The other variables (`ans2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Given that `a` is sorted in descending order, the sum of all elements in `a` is simply the sum of all its elements, and this value is now assigned to `ans1`.

Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
