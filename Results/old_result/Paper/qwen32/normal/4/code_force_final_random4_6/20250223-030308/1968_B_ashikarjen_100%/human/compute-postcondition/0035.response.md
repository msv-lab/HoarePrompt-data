The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `m` remain unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `b[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m` remain unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `b[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`**
