Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string starting with the first character of `a` followed by characters from `b` starting from the index where `work` was set to `False` or the end of `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, and `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`. Otherwise, `counter` remains 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
