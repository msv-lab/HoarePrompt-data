Output State: **`t` is a new string input by the user; `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `s` is the new string input by the user; `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`; `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`; `cnt` is 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0; `i` is `n-1` based on the original `n`; if the count of '1's in the new `s` is equal to the count of '1's in the new `t`, no additional variable `d` is defined. Otherwise, `d` is defined as the absolute difference between the new `s1` and `t1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are not equal. All other variables retain their initial values unless `cnt` is updated.
