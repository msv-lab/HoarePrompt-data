To determine the output, let's break down the given information and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input string representing the number of test cases.
- `x` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[0]` from ten different inputs.
- `y` is a list containing ten integer values of `xylist[1]` from ten different inputs.
- `i` is set to 1.

### Condition:
- If `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. Otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is 1.
- The print statement will output `y[1]` followed by a space and then `x[1]`.

### Output:
Given the initial state, we know the exact positions of the values we need to print, but we don't know the exact values of `x[1]` and `y[1]` because they are determined by the input. However, based on the information provided, we can describe the exact values that will be printed.

Output: **y[1]  x[1] (where y[1] is the second element of the y list and x[1] is the second element of the x list)**
