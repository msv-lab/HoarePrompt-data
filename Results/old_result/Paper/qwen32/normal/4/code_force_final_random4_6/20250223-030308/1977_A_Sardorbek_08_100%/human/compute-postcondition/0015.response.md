Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`, and `b` is not equal to `c`. If `b` is less than `c`, then no additional changes occur. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then no additional changes occur unless `b` and `c` have different parities, in which case `b % 2` is not equal to `c % 2`.**
