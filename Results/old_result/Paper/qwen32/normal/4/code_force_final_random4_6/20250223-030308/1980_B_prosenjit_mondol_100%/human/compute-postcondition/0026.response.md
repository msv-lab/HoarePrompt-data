Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 999, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input minus 2, `k` is the third integer from the new input minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the list `a`. If `a[k] < x`, no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
