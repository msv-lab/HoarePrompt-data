The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` sets the bit at position `cur_ss` in the integer `cur` to 1. Since initially `cur` is 0 and the bit at position `cur_ss` is not set, after executing this line, `cur` will be equal to `1 << cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[0]) - ord('a')`. Additionally, the bitwise AND of `cur` and `1 << cur_ss` is now non-zero, indicating that the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set.**
