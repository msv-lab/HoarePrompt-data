The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Initially, `num` is 0, so after the execution, `num` becomes 1. The value of `m` is initially defined as `n - num`. Since `num` has now changed from 0 to 1, the value of `m` will be recalculated as `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is 1, `m` is `n - 1`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, and `c` equals `r`.**
