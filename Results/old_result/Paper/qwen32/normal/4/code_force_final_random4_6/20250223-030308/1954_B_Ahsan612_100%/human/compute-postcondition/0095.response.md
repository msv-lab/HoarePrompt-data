Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` is the length of the new `ar` list; `i` is either 1 or 2; if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is `ar[2]`.**
