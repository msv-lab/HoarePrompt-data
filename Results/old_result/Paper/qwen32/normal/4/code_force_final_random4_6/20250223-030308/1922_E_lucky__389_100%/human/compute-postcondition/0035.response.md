Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18; `x` is any non-zero integer; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`; `i` is the smallest integer such that `2^i` is greater than `x`, and `i` is not equal to 0**
