The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is 2. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is the previous `ans1` plus `a[1]` minus `a[1 + x] * 2` and `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans1` plus `a[1]`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged from their previous values; `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans2`.**
