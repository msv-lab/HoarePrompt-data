Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` contains at least one less tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, `visited` contains all visited nodes, `current` is the first node from the `queue`, `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns the distance from `start` to `current`, which is `dist`. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues with the remaining logic.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, `visited` contains all visited nodes, `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor, `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `visited` includes `neighbor` and `queue` has an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, including `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `visited` contains all visited nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least two neighbors. `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, including `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, it is now added to `visited`, and the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is appended to `queue`. `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least one more neighbor. `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged. `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
