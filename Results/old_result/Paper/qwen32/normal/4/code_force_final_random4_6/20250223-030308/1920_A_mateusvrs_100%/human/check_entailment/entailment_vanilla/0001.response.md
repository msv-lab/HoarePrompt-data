Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Initialization**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
    - For each test case, the program reads the number of constraints `n`.
    - It initializes `cx` as an empty set to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3 (not equal to).
    - It initializes `ax` to a large value (1000000000 + 7) and `bx` to -1. `ax` will store the minimum value for constraints of type 2 (less than or equal to), and `bx` will store the maximum value for constraints of type 1 (greater than or equal to).

3. **Reading Constraints**:
    - For each constraint, the program reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
    - If `a` is 1 (greater than or equal to), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
    - If `a` is 2 (less than or equal to), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
    - If `a` is 3 (not equal to), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Calculating the Result**:
    - If `bx` (the minimum value `k` must be greater than or equal to) is greater than `ax` (the maximum value `k` must be less than or equal to), it means there are no valid values of `k` that can satisfy all constraints, so it appends 0 to the results list `r`.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`. It does this by iterating over `cx` and counting how many of these values are in the range `[bx, ax]`. It then subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` (which is `ax - bx + 1`) and appends the result to `r`.

5. **Output**:
    - Finally, it prints all the results stored in `r`, each on a new line.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic for updating `bx` and `ax` and the calculation of the result are correct. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
