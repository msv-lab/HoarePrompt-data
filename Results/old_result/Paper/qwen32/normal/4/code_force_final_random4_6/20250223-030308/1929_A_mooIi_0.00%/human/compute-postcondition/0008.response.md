The loop head in the provided code snippet only involves the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop continuation, the only variable that could influence the loop's execution is the result of `int(input())`. However, since `int(input())` is used to determine the number of iterations at the start of the loop and does not change within the loop, we cannot adjust it directly based on the previous iteration's state.

Given that the loop runs a fixed number of times determined by the user input `n`, the state at the start of each iteration does not need to change in terms of loop control variables. The variable `t` and `ar` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop counter (which is represented by `_` and is not explicitly shown) would have incremented by one internally.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is the integer input by the user, `ar` is a map object containing the sorted string representations of integers from the input**.
