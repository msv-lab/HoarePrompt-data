Output State: **The loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is the number of iterations specified. For each of the `n` iterations, integers `a` and `b` were read from the input, and based on the conditions provided, 'YES' or 'NO' was printed. The value of `i` in the loop ranges from 0 to `n-1`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the execution.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished executing for all `n` iterations. For each iteration, it read two integers `a` and `b`, and printed 'YES' if neither `a` and `b` were both odd nor one was exactly half of the other. Otherwise, it printed 'NO'. The loop counter `i` went from 0 to `n-1`, and the total number of test cases `t` and the number of iterations `n` stayed the same throughout the loop execution.
