The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `coord`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `n`, while `coord` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list.**
