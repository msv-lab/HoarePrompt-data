To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `while r - l > 1:`. This means that for the loop to continue, the difference between `r` and `l` must be greater than 1.

The variables `l` and `r` are the only ones mentioned in the loop condition, so we can only adjust these two variables.

### Analysis:
- At the end of the previous iteration, the condition `r - l > 1` must have been true for the loop to have executed.
- To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `r - l` remains greater than 1 after the updates to `l` and `r`.

### Possible Updates:
- If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to `(l + r) // 2` and `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
- If `array[mid]` is greater than `find`, then `r` is updated to `(l + r) // 2` and `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`.

In both cases, `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`. However, the value of `l` or `r` is updated based on the comparison between `array[mid]` and `find`. To ensure that `r - l > 1` after the update, we need to make sure that the new values of `l` and `r` still satisfy this condition.

### Adjustment:
To ensure that `r - l > 1` after the update, we need to make sure that the initial values of `l` and `r` are such that after the update, the difference remains greater than 1. This means that `l` and `r` should be chosen such that after the update, `r - l` is still greater than 1.

### Example Adjustment:
- Suppose at the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 2 and `r` is 5. Then `r - l` is 3, which is greater than 1.
- If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to `(2 + 5) // 2 = 3` and `r` remains 5. Now `r - l` is 2, which is still greater than 1.
- If `array[mid]` is greater than `find`, then `r` is updated to `(2 + 5) // 2 = 3` and `l` remains 2. Now `r - l` is 1, which is not greater than 1. This means we need to adjust `r` to be at least 4 to ensure that `r - l > 1`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `r - l` is greater than 1. The simplest way to do this is to ensure that `r` is at least `l + 2` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `r` must be at least `l + 2`**
