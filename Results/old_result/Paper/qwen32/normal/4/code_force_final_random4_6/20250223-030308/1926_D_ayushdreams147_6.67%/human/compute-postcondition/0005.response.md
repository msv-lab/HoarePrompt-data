The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of the variable `res` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `count`, and `num`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is 1, `count` is a dictionary with the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` having the value 1, and `num` is not a key in the `count` dictionary (except for the newly added key).**
