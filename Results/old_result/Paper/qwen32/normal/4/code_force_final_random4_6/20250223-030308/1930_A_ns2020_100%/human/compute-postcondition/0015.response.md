The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in the list `A`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 4999, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `A` is a list of integers provided by the new input.**

In simpler terms: The value of `A` is now a list of integers read from the input, while `t`, `n`, and `a` retain their original values.
