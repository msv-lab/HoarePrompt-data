Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` remains the initial input value, `k` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `a + 1`
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` remains the initial input value, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b` if `b` contains the character '1', otherwise `k` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `a + 1`, and `b` is the string provided by the user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains the initial input value; `i` is equal to `a + 1`; `b` is the new string provided by the user input. If `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list with the previous counts of '1' in `b` plus the new count of '1' in the newly provided `b`. Otherwise, `k` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains the initial input value; `i` is equal to `a + 1`; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `k` is a list with the previous counts of '1' in `b` plus the new count of '1' in the newly provided `b` if `b` contains '1`, otherwise `k` is an empty list; the number of remaining iterations is one less than the previous input value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
