The initial state describes the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`, but the `print` statement only involves `n`. The value of `n` is given as an input integer, and the statement `print(n - 1)` will output the value of `n` decremented by 1.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the input integer)**
