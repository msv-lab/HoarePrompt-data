The code snippet `x = b.index(i)` updates the value of `x` to the index of `i` in the list `b`. Given the initial state, `i` is `s_next`, which is the next element in the list `s`. The value of `x` is now the position of `s_next` in the list `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `r` is the string `a[x]`; `b` is a list with the value at index `x` incremented by 1; `x` is the index of `i` in `b`; `i` is `s_next`, where `s_next` is the next element in the list `s`. The value of `x` has been updated to the index of `i` in `b`.**
