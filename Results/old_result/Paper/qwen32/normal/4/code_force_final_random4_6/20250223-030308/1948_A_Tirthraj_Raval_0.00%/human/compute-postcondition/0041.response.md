The code provided initializes an empty list named `pattern`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The only new element introduced is the `pattern` list, which is empty.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 49; `n` is the new input integer; `pattern` is an empty list.**
