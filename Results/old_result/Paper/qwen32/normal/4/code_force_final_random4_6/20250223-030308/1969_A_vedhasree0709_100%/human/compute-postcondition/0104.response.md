Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that the value at `p[p[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`. If such an index is found, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`.**
