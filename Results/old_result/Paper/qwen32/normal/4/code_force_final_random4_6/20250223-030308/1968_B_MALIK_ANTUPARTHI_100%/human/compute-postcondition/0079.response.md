The `break` statement will exit the loop prematurely, which means that the value of `j` will be the value at which the loop breaks, and `k` will be `j + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged. The value of `i` will be the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, as the loop breaks before the next iteration can increment `i`. The condition that either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1` will still hold true because the loop breaks before any further changes can be made to `j` or `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is the first integer read from input and must be greater than 0; `c` is the second integer read from input; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new string read from input; `j` is the value at which the loop breaks; `k` is `j + 1`; `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; the character at index `j` of string `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k`. Additionally, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.**
