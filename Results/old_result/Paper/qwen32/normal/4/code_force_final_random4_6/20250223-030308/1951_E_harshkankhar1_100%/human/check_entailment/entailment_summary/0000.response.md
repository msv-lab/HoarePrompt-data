### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input**: A string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
2. **Output**: 
   - "YES" if the string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
   - "NO" if such a partition does not exist.
   - If "YES", also output the number of parts `k` and the substrings.

#### Functions Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if the input string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.
   
2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `1`, and the string `s` itself as the partition.
   - If the entire string is a palindrome, it searches for the first character that differs from the first character of the string.
   - If no such character is found, it means the string consists of the same repeated character, and it prints "NO".
   - If a differing character is found at index `x`, it then checks if the substring starting from `x+1` is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `2`, and the substrings `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.
   - If the substring starting from `x+1` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is `1` or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of the string). If either is true, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of parts as `2`, and the substrings `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

#### Test Cases Verification:
1. **Test case 1**: `sinktheyacht`
   - The string is not a palindrome, so the function correctly prints "YES", `1`, and the string itself.
2. **Test case 2**: `lllllllll`
   - The string is a palindrome, and all substrings are palindromes, so the function correctly prints "NO".
3. **Test case 3**: `uwuowouwu`
   - The string is a palindrome, and the function finds a differing character at index `1`. The substring starting from index `2` is not a palindrome, so it prints "YES", `2`, and the substrings `uw` and `uowouwu`.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly handle the problem requirements and pass the given test cases. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
