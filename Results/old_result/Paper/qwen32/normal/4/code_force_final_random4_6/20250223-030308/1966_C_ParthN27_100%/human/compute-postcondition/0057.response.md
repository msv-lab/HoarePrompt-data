The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs a simple string 'Alice'. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, and `ans`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
