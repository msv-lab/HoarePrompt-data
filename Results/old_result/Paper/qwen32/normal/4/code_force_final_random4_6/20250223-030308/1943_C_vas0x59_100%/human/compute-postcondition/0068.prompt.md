Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` remains unchanged as it is a list of adjacency lists representing the tree; `d` remains unchanged as it is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices; `a` remains unchanged as it is the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` remains unchanged as it is the list of previous vertices for the shortest path tree; `b` remains unchanged as it is also the return value of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` will be a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in reverse order; `ops` is an empty list; the length of `path_ba` is even; `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` remains unchanged, `d` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `previous` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `path_ba` is a list with more than one element, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u2vs` remains unchanged, `d` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `previous` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `path_ba` is a list with more than one element, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, and the newly appended `(c2, i)`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `i` is `i + 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `u2vs` remains unchanged, `d` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `previous` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `path_ba` is a list with more than one element, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, and `(c2, i)`, the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is `len(path_ba) // 2`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`, `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`, `i` is `i + 4` (if `i + 4 < len(path_ba) - ci1`)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
