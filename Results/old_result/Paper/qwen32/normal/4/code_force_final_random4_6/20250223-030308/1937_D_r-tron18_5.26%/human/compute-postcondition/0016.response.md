To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`.
- `suffZero` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `0`.
- `zeroInd` is `0`.
- `oneInd` is `preOne[1]`.

The code snippet:
```python
oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
```

Here, `oneInd` is initially `preOne[1]`. The function `func_1(preOne, 1)` must be evaluated to determine the exact impact on `oneInd`. Without knowing the definition of `func_1`, we can only assume that `func_1(preOne, 1)` returns some value based on `preOne` and the index `1`.

For the sake of this exercise, let's assume `func_1(preOne, 1)` returns a specific value, say `x`. Therefore, the new value of `oneInd` would be `preOne[1] - x`.

Given the initial state, the output state after executing the code snippet would be:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `0`, `zeroInd` is `0`, `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` remains a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` remains the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` remains a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` remains `[0]`, `ans` remains a list of `n` zeros, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` remains `n - 1`, `el` remains `s1[n - 1]` which is '>', `ol` remains `totalOne`, `zr` remains `0`, `zeroInd` remains `0`, and `oneInd` is updated to `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
