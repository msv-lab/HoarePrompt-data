To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **User Inputs:**
   - `t`: An integer input by the user, greater than 0.
   - `n`: An integer input by the user.
   - `k`: An integer input by the user.
   - `a`: A list of integers provided by the user.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `favorite_value`: The value at index `f - 1` of the list `a` (where `f` is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred as an index related to `favorite_value`).
   - `sorted_a`: The list `a` sorted in descending order.
   - `removed_count`: The number of times `favorite_value` appears in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`.
   - `favorite_count`: The number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire `sorted_a` list.

3. **Additional Information:**
   - `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `sorted_a`, `removed_count`, or `favorite_count`. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Since the print statement does not reference any variables and is a static string, the output will always be `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
