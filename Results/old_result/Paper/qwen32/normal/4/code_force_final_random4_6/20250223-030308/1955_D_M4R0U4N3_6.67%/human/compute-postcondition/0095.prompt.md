Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input; `done` is a set (now empty); `extra` is an empty set; `j` is `m`; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    if a[j] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[j])
        done.add(a[j])
    else:
        extra.add(a[j])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing the element `a[0]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set; `extra` is an empty set if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains the integer `a[0]`; `j` is 0; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing the element `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set, and now also contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`; `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains the integer `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo`; `j` is 1; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`, and also excluding `a[2]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`, and `a[2]` if `a[2]` was in `todo`; `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not in `todo`, and also contains `a[2]` if `a[2]` was not in `todo`; `j` is 2; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
