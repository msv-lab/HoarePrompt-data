Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is `k - 1`; `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`; `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as described in the initial state; `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain as they were described in the initial state. The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The values of `s` and `b` are recalculated based on the initial state expressions. The values of `bm` and `sm` are updated using the new value of `k`. The values of `sp` and `bp` are incremented by twice the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
