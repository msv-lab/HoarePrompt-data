Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: The sum of all elements in the matrix should be maximized. The maximum possible sum can be achieved by filling each row and column with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1]. This permutation ensures that the highest possible numbers are placed in the matrix, thus maximizing the sum.
2. **Operations**: The problem allows up to \( 2n \) operations. Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, we can fill each row and each column once, using exactly \( 2n \) operations.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows this strategy:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
2. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix, which is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \). This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and their permutations.
3. **Operations**: The program then outputs \( 2n \) operations, where the first \( n \) operations fill each row with the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1], and the next \( n \) operations fill each column with the same permutation.

### Verification:
- **Sum Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the sum is correct for the maximum sum achievable with the described operations.
- **Operations**: The operations specified are valid and ensure that each row and column is filled with the highest possible permutation, thus achieving the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
