To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the `pattern` list based on the value of `n`.

The loop iterates `n // 2` times, appending pairs of characters 'A' and 'B' to the `pattern` list in an alternating fashion. Specifically, for each iteration `i`, it appends `'AB'[i % 2]` followed by `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`. This means:
- On the 0th iteration, it appends 'A' and 'B'.
- On the 1st iteration, it appends 'B' and 'A'.
- On the 2nd iteration, it appends 'A' and 'B', and so on.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the 1st iteration, `pattern` is ['A', 'B'].
- After the 2nd iteration, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A'].
- After the 3rd iteration, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'B'].

We can see that the pattern continues to alternate as described.

The loop will execute `n // 2` times. Therefore, the final `pattern` list will have `2 * (n // 2) = n` elements if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, the loop will still execute `n // 2` times, and the `pattern` list will have `2 * (n // 2)` elements, which is `n - 1` elements, and no additional changes will be made to the variables as per the problem statement.

Thus, the final state of `pattern` will be a list with `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is the input integer, `pattern` is a list with `n` elements alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.**

In simpler terms, the final `pattern` list will have `n` elements that alternate between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A'.
