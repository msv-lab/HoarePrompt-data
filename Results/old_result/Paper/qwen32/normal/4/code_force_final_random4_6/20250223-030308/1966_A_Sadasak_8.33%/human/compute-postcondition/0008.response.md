Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k`; if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now set to `k`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The value of `frequency_table[num]` is directly set to `k`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
