Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is equal to 0; `work` is False; `j` is `len(a) - 1`; `counter` is the final count based on the conditions in the loop.**
