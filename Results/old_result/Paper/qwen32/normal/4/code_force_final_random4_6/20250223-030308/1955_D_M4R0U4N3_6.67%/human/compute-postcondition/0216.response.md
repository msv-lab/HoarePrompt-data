Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input. For each test case, the final `ans` value represents the number of times during the sliding window process that the number of elements in the `done` set was greater than or equal to `k`. The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are reset at the start of each test case and are only relevant within the context of that specific test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations:
- The loop has processed all `t` test cases.
- For each test case, `ans` tells us how many times the sliding window contained at least `k` elements that were originally in the `todo` set.
- The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are specific to each test case and are not maintained across test cases.
