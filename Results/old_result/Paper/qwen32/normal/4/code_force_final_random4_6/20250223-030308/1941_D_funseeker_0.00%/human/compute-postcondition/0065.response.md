The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given the initial state, we know that `temp` already contains `(q - r) % n` and possibly `(q + r) % n` depending on the value of `c`. After executing this line, `temp` will definitely contain `(q + r) % n`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, `_`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`; `_` is incremented by 1; `q` is the next element in the set `ans` after the current one; `temp` is a set containing `(q - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n`.**
