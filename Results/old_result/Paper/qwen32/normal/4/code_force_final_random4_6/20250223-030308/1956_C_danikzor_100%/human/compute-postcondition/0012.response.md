Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of n x n matrices, each filled with zeroes, where n is an integer between 1 and 500 provided in each test case. The total number of test cases t is between 1 and 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.**
