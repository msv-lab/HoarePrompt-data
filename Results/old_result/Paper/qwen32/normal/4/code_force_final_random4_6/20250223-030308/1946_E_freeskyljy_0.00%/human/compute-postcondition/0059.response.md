The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `nums_left` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. Given the initial state, `nums_left` is -3, and `MOD` is an implicit constant that is not explicitly defined in the snippet but is implied to be used in the modulo operation.

Since `nums_left` is -3, `ans` will be updated to `ans * -3 % MOD`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n; `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`; Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`; At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `nums_left` is -3; `M2` is greater than 1; `i` is `N - 1`; If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is increased to 2. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * -1 % MOD` and `cur` remains 1. If `cur` was 1 and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `ans` is further updated to `ans * -2 % MOD`; `ans` is updated to `ans * -3 % MOD`.**
