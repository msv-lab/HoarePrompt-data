Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `d` is an input integer; `b` is a non-empty string; `j` is 3. If `b[j]` is '@', then `s` is 2; otherwise, `s` is 0. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', the loop breaks. If the character at index `j` in `b` is not '*', the loop does not break and the character at index `j` remains unchanged.**
