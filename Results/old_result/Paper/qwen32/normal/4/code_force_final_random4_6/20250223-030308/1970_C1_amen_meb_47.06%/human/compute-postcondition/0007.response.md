The code snippet `num2 = int(nums[1])` converts the second element of the list `nums` from a string to an integer and assigns it to the variable `num2`. 

Given the initial state, `nums` is a list of strings, and `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`. After executing the code snippet, `num2` will hold the integer value of `nums[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is an empty list; `nums` is a list of strings; `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`; `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`.**
