Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Program Explanation

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum and outputs the operations needed to achieve this sum.

1. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - The matrix is initially filled with permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \). However, the program does not actually fill the matrix; it only calculates the sum based on the expected values.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1) \times (2i+1)
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the expected maximum sum when rows and columns are filled optimally.

3. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \).
   - It then prints \( 2n \) operations, each consisting of filling a row and a column with the permutation from 1 to \( n \).

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The formula used to calculate the sum seems to be derived from the sum of the first \( n \) squares and the sum of the first \( n \) integers, but it's not immediately clear if it correctly represents the maximum possible sum for the matrix.

2. **Operations:**
   - The operations specified (filling rows and columns with permutations) are valid based on the problem's constraints.
   - However, the specific permutations used in the operations are not optimal for maximizing the sum. The program uses the same permutation (1 to \( n \)) for all rows and columns, which does not guarantee the maximum sum.

### Conclusion

The program's logic for calculating the sum and the operations is flawed. The sum calculation does not correctly represent the maximum possible sum, and the operations do not ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
