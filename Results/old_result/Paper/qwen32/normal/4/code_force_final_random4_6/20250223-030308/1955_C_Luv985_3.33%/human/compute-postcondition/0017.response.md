The value of `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer decreased by `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`; `mi * 2` is less than or equal to the original value of `k`.**
