To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the components and their values based on the initial state provided.

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is an integer defined as the input integer plus 3.

2. **Expression breakdown:**
   - `n - j + 1`: This expression involves the subtraction of `j` (which is the input integer plus 3) from `n`, and then adding 1 to the result.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Output components:**
   - The first value printed is the integer `1`.
   - The second value printed is the result of the expression `n - j + 1`.
   - The third part of the output is the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)`.

Let's put this together in a clear format:
- The first value is always `1`.
- The second value is `n - (input integer + 3) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - input integer - 2`.
- The third part is the sequence from `1` to `n`.

**Output Description:**
The `print` statement will output the integer `1`, followed by the result of the expression `n - input integer - 2`, and then the sequence of integers from `1` to `n`.

Output: **1, n - input integer - 2, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and input integer is the integer provided as input to calculate j)**
