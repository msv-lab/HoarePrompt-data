Postcondition: **`removals` is greater than 0; `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`; `elements` is unchanged; `i` is unchanged. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`. Otherwise, `s2` remains `s2 - elements[-i]`.**
