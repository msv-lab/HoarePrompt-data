You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints 'YES' if neither `a` nor `b` is odd and they are not such that one is exactly half of the other; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob starts with a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then, he needs to determine if he can form a different rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.

### Key Observations:
1. **If either dimension is 1**:
   - If the rectangle is \(1 \times 1\), it cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.
   - If the rectangle is \(1 \times b\) (or \(b \times 1\)), it can only be cut into \(1 \times 1\) pieces, which can only form a \(1 \times b\) (or \(b \times 1\)) rectangle, which is not different.

2. **If both dimensions are odd**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles will result in rectangles with at least one odd dimension. These smaller rectangles cannot form a new rectangle with integer sides that is different from the original rectangle.

3. **If one dimension is even**:
   - If one of the dimensions is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. These smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the logic in the provided program:
- The program first reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
- It then checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If true, it prints 'NO'.
- It also checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`). If true, it prints 'NO'. However, this condition is incorrect because it doesn't cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.
- If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES'.

### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is incorrect. For example, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, but the program would incorrectly print 'NO' for this case.
- The program correctly handles the case where both dimensions are odd, but the logic for handling other cases is flawed.

### Correctness:
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
