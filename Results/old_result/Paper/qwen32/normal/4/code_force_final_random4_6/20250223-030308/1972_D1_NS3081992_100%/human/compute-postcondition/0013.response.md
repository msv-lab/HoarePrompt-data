Output State: **The program returns the sum of `(n + j) // (j * j)` for all integers `j` from 1 to `i-1`, minus 1.**

This means that the program calculates the sum of the integer division of `(n + j)` by `(j * j)` for each `j` ranging from 1 to `i-1`, and then subtracts 1 from this sum. The value of `i` is determined to be the smallest integer that is either greater than `m` or satisfies the condition `i * i > n + i`.
