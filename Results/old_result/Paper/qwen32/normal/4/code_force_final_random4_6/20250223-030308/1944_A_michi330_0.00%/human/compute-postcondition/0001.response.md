To determine the state required for the for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head is defined as:

```python
for i in range(0, t, 1):
```

Here, the variables involved are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value, which means `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already defined as an input integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3`, it is guaranteed that `t` is greater than 0, and thus the loop will execute.

However, the initial value of `i` before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted because the `range` function will initialize `i` to 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The state is already appropriate as given.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
