Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with no leading or trailing whitespace and length at least 2; `b` is the input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string constructed by alternating between characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop conditions; `i` is equal to `len(a)`; `work` is False; `j` is 0; `counter` is 1; the character at position `j + 1` in `a` is '0' and the character at position `j` in `b` is '1'**
