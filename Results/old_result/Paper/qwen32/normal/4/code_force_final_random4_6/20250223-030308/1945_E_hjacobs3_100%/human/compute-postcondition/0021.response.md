The provided `print` statement is:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement is independent of the variables and objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Explanation:
- The initial state describes various variables and their relationships, such as `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `r`.
- However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It directly prints the integer `1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
