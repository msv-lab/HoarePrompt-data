Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations for each test case, printing the first integer `i` that is not in `mpp.keys()` or the first integer `i` such that `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True` for each test case. The variable `first` will be `False` if no integer with a frequency of 1 was encountered after the first occurrence of such an integer, and `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes for each test case.**

In simpler terms: For each test case, the loop will print the smallest integer `i` that is either not present in the list `arr` or appears exactly once in `arr` after another integer that also appears exactly once. After processing all test cases, the loop will have finished all iterations, and the variable `first` will be reset to `False` if no second unique integer was found, with `i` reaching `n + 1` for each test case.
