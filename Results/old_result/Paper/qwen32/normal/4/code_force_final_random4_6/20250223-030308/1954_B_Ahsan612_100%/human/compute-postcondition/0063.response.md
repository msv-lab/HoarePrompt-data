Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 3; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[4]`, and `minn` is 1.**
