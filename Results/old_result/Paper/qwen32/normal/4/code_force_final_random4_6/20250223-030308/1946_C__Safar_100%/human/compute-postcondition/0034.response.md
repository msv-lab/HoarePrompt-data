Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a tree, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed (where 1 <= k < n), and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree. The function determines and prints the maximum value for which a certain condition (checked by the `check` function) holds true after attempting to remove `k` edges from the tree.**
