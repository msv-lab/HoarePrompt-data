Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `c` is the input string that must have at least 1 character, `slength` is the input integer, `tests` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, `no` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `no` remains True.**
