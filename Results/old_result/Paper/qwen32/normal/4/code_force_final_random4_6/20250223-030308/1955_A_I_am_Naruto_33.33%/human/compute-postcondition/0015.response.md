Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input. If `n` > 1, then `ans1` is `a * n` and `ans2` is `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` are not defined.**
