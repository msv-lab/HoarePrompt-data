The `while` loop condition in the provided code is `high >= cur`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `high` and `cur` such that this condition remains true. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, then `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.
- In both cases, `high` must be at least `cur`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`. If `high` is currently less than `cur`, we need to adjust `high` to be at least `cur`. If `high` is already greater than or equal to `cur`, no adjustment is needed.

Since the problem states that `high` must be at least `cur`, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `high` is not less than `cur`. Therefore, we can simply state that `high` must be at least `cur`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` must be at least `cur`**
