The value of `rank[da - 1]` is updated to `tmp + 1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `d[da]` has `n` elements, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is an integer, `rank` is a list of integers where `rank[da - 1]` is now `tmp + 1`, and `tmp` is the minimum of its previous value and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all elements `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0.
