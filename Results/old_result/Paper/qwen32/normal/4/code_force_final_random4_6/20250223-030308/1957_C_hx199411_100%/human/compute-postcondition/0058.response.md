Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 2 or 3 or 4, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, `num` is 3 or 4.**
