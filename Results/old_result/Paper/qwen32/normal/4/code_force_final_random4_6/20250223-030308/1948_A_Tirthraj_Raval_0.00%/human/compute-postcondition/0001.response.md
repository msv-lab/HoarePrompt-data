The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. Given the constraints, `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), which means the loop will execute by default.

Therefore, the state does not need any adjustment for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50**
