Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`. Since the `if` condition `k == 0` is not met (`k` is -2), the program does not enter the `if` block and thus no changes are made to the variables within the `if` block.**
