To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the variable `i` is used.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). The value of `t` is not directly relevant to the current `print(i)` statement.
2. **`n`**: An input integer that must be at least 0. The value of `n` is not directly relevant to the current `print(i)` statement.
3. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained by splitting an input line and converting each split component to an integer. The contents of `arr` are not directly relevant to the current `print(i)` statement.
4. **`mpp`**: A `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. The contents of `mpp` are not directly relevant to the current `print(i)` statement.
5. **`first`**: A boolean variable. The value of `first` is not directly relevant to the current `print(i)` statement.
6. **`i`**: The variable `i` is described as `i + 1`. This suggests that `i` is being incremented by 1 in the context of some loop or operation, but the exact value of `i` before this increment is not provided.

### Analysis:
Given the information, the only variable we need to focus on is `i`. The statement `i` is `i + 1` implies that `i` is being incremented by 1. However, we do not have the initial value of `i` before this increment.

Without knowing the initial value of `i`, we can only say that the value printed will be the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the incremented value of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1)**
