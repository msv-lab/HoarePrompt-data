The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` using a specific formula. Let's break down the changes and provide the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`
- `i` is equal to 5
- `m` is equal to `n - num` and `m` must be at least 4
- `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25

The code snippet:
```python
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```
Given `i` is 5, the code calculates `dp[5]` as follows:
- `dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[5] = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[5] = (25 + 56) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[5] = 81 % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[5] = 81`

So, `dp[5]` is updated to 81. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is equal to 5; `m` is equal to `n - num` and `m` must be at least 4; `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81.**
