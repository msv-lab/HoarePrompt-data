Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The list `coord` now contains a single tuple `(x, y)` as a result of the `append` operation. All other variables retain their initial values.
