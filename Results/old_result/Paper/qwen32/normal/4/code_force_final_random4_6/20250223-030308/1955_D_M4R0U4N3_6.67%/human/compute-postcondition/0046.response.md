The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `extra`. Given the initial state, `old` is `a[1]`, and `extra` contains all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, with `old` potentially being one of those elements.

Since `old` is removed from `extra`, the set `extra` will no longer contain `old`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input with `a[r]` removed if `a[r]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` with adjustments based on the presence of `old`, and now includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, with `old` removed if it was present, and now includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`, and `old` has been removed from `extra`; `j` is `m`; `old` is `a[1]`; If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1; `r` is `m + 1`.**
