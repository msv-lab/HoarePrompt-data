The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `a`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that `i` is the current element of the list `a` at the end of the previous iteration, in the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list `a`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current element of the list `a`.
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
- For the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the list `a`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can only say that `i` will be the next element in the list `a` for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(new_i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuples `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)` and `(-abs(new_i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`, `i` is the next element in the list `a`**
