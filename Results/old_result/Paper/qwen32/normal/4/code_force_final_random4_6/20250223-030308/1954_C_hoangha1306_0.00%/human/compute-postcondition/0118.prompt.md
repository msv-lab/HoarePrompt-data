Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is '', `kq2` is '', `vt` is 0, `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of the last compared characters, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, and `q` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to `a[i]` and `vt` remains 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq1` is the string representation of `x` while `kq2` is the string representation of `y` if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `b[i]`; otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was 0, it is now 1. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated as described regardless of the previous value of `vt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was 0, `vt` is set to 1, and `kq1` and `kq2` are updated with the string representations of `y` and `x` respectively if `a[i] > b[i]`, or `x` and `y` respectively if `a[i] <= b[i]`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)` regardless of the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both updated to `kq1 + a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `vt` was 0, it is now 1. `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with the string representation of `y`. `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with the string representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
