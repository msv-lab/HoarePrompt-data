### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters where there are exactly `n` special characters. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
4. If `n` is even, it prints "YES" and constructs a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters. This construction ensures that each character in the alternating pattern will be equal to exactly one of its neighbors, resulting in exactly `n` special characters.

The example provided in the problem statement supports the correctness of this approach:
- For `n = 6`, the output "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters.
- For `n = 1`, the output "NO" is correct because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters.
- For `n = 2`, the output "MM" (or any other pair of identical characters) has 2 special characters.

The program logic correctly handles both the cases where `n` is odd and `n` is even, adhering to the problem's requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
