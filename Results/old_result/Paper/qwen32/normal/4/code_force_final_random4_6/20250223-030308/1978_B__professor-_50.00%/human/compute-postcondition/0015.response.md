To determine what will be printed, let's break down the code and the initial state provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input.
- If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, no change is made to `a` or `b`.
- If `b` is greater than `a`, the difference between `b` and `a` is either at least `n` or less than `n`.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `n`: An integer.
   - `a`: An integer.
   - `b`: An integer.
   - The relationship between `a` and `b` affects the computation but does not directly influence the formula in the `print` statement. The formula only involves `b` and `n`.

2. **Formula Breakdown**:
   - The formula inside the `print` statement is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.
   - This formula is a bit reminiscent of the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, specifically the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is `(2 * b - n + 1)` and the common difference is `1`.

3. **Simplification**:
   - The formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` calculates the sum of the arithmetic series starting from `(2 * b - n + 1)` and having `n` terms.
   - This can be interpreted as the sum of the sequence: `(2 * b - n + 1), (2 * b - n + 2), ..., (2 * b)`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the integer value of the sum of the arithmetic series starting from `(2 * b - n + 1)` and having `n` terms.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) (where this is the sum of the arithmetic series starting from (2 * b - n + 1) and having n terms)**
