Reasoning:  
The provided program seems to be attempting to solve the problem, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed for it to be correct.

1. **Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**: The current logic in the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations. The program checks if `k` is in the frequency table values and returns `k - 1` if true, otherwise it returns `n`. This logic is not valid for determining the minimum number of cards.

2. **Frequency Table Construction**: The function `func_1` constructs a frequency table with counts capped at `k`. While this is a step in the right direction, it does not directly help in determining the minimum number of cards. Instead, we need to use the frequency table to calculate the minimum number of cards based on the operations allowed.

3. **Operations Allowed**: The operations allow us to reduce the number of cards by `k` and replace them with `k-1` cards. This means that for each unique number with a count of `x`, we can reduce the count by `k` repeatedly until the count is less than `k`. The final count for each unique number can be calculated as `x % k`. The sum of these final counts for all unique numbers will give us the minimum number of cards.

4. **Special Cases**: The program correctly handles cases where `k > n` by printing `n` and where `k == n` by printing `k - 1`. However, these special cases are not sufficient for all scenarios.

To fix the program, we need to modify the logic to correctly compute the minimum number of cards based on the frequency table and the allowed operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = {}
        for num in nums:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        min_cards = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            min_cards += count % k
        
        # If min_cards is 0, it means we can make all counts multiples of k,
        # and we can reduce to k-1 cards in the last operation.
        if min_cards == 0:
            min_cards = k - 1
        
        print(min_cards)
```

Given the issues with the original program, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
