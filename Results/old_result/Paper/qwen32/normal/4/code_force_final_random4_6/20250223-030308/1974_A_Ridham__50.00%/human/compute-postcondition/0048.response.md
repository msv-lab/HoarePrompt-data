The code snippet provided updates the `remaining_cells` variable based on the current values of `screen_require_for_y` and `space_y`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly updated in the code snippet, which is not the case here.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is `n + 1`, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15.**

In simpler terms, the `remaining_cells` variable has been recalculated, but all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
