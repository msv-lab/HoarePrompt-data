You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function will be called multiple times for different test cases, with the first input being the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the input integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, integers `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input. The output for each test case is determined based on the conditions: if `b <= a`, the output is `n * a`; if `b - a >= n`, the output is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2 * b - n + 1` with a common difference of `-1`; otherwise, the output is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference of `1`, plus `a * n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n` multiplied by `a`. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2 * b - n + 1` with a common difference of `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference of `1`, plus `a * n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all cases. Let's analyze the logic and identify the potential issues.

The program has three main conditions:
1. If `b <= a`, it calculates the profit as `n * a`.
2. If `b - a >= n`, it calculates the profit as `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the profit as `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

However, the third condition is incorrect. It incorrectly calculates the profit for the case where the modified price `b` is greater than `a`, but not by enough to cover all `n` buns at the modified price. The formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)` is not the correct way to calculate the profit for the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
1. If `b <= a`, sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
2. Otherwise, determine the optimal `k` where the profit is maximized. This involves selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices `(b - i + 1)` and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

The correct formula for the profit when selling `k` buns at the modified price is:
\[ \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) + a \times (n - k) \]

Let's consider a test case to illustrate the issue:
- Input: `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`
- Expected Output: `35` (as given in the problem statement)

The program would incorrectly calculate the profit for `k = 5` as:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(9 - 5) / 2 \times (9 - 5 + 1) + 5 \times 5} = \frac{2 \times 5 + 25} = 35 \]

However, the correct calculation for `k = 5` should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = (9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5) = 35 \]

The issue arises in the formula used for the third condition. The program does not correctly handle the summation of the modified prices for the first `k` buns.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this and potentially other cases where the modified price `b` is greater than `a` but not by enough to cover all `n` buns at the modified price.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            max_profit = 0
            for k in range(n + 1):
                profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(1, k + 1)) + a * (n - k)
                max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
            print(max_profit)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum profit is calculated by considering all possible values of `k` and summing the prices correctly.
