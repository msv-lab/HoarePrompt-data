The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after the increment, `i` becomes 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `q`, `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 3; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is 3; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[l[2] - 1]`; if `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
