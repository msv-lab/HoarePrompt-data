Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is 3. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is set to `a[3] + k // 4`, `rem` is set to `k % 4`, `y` is set to `n - 4`, and `k` is set to 0, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `4 * (a[4] - a[3])`, and `r` is set to `a[4]`.**
