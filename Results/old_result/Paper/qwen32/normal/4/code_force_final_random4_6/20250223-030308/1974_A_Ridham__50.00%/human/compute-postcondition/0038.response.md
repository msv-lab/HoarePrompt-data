Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` remains `n - 1`; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`; If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`; `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`; `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15, otherwise `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`; If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` and also contains the value `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` appended to it. `x` and `y` are updated to the values read from the input.**

In simpler terms: The output state includes all the previous conditions and values, except that the `result` list now contains an additional element which is the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` appended to it.
