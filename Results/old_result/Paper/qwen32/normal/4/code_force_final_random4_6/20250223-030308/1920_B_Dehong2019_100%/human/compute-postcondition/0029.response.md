Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is 2. `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans1` plus `a[1]`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `ans2`. It is now set to the maximum value between its previous value and the value of `ans1` plus `a[1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
