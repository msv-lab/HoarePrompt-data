Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two arrays: Petya's array `a` of length `n` and Vasya's array `b` of length `m`. It calculates and prints the sum of the absolute differences between elements of the sorted Petya's array and a selected subset of Vasya's array. The selection from Vasya's array is done in a specific manner based on the comparison of absolute differences, ensuring the minimum possible sum for the given conditions.**
