Postcondition: **`queue` has one less element, `visited` contains all reachable nodes except `neighbor`, `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor, `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree[current]` is a list with at least one element, and `neighbor` is not in `visited`.**
