Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, which is still constrained by the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The other variables (`n` and `a`) remain unchanged as they have not been assigned any values yet in the provided code snippet.
