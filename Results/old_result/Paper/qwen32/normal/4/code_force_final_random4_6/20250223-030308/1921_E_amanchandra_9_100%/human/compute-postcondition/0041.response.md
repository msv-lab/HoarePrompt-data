Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer. For each test case, the program has determined and printed the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') based on the provided conditions. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are re-assigned for each iteration based on the input values of each test case, and no changes are made to these variables outside of the loop iterations.**

In simpler terms, the program has processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has printed whether 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' is the result. The variables used within the loop (`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) are updated for each test case but do not retain their values after the loop completes.
