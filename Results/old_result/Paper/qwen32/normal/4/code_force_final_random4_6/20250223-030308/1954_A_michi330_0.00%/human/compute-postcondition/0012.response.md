Postcondition: **`itest` is 1, `t` is at least 2, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, the condition of the if statement is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition of the else statement is satisfied. In both cases, the values of `itest`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
