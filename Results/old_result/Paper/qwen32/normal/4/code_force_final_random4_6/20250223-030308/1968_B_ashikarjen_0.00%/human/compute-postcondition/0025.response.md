The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given that the initial value of `j` is 2, after the increment, `j` will be 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `m` must be at least 3; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `i` is -1; `j` is 3; `b[0]` is not equal to `a[0]`.**
