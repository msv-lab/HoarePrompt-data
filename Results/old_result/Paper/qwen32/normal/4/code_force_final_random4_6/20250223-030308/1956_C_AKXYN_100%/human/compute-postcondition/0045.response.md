`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `mat` is a list of 5 lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to 5, `res` is 95, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of 5 lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to 5, `res` is 95, `i` is 1**.
