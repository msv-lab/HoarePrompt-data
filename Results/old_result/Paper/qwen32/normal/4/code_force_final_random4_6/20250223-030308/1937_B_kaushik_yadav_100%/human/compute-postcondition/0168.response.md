Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the new input string with no leading or trailing whitespace and `a` is not an empty string; `b` is the updated input string with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is an empty string; `i` is 0; `work` is False; `j` is len(a) - 1; `counter` reflects the number of consecutive matches of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` until the loop breaks or completes.**
