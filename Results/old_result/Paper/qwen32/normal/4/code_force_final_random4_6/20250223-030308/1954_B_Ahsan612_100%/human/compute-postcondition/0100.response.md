The code snippet assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Given that `i` is either 3 or 4, the value of `num` will be `ar[3]` or `ar[4]` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4 (after decrementing by 1); `ar` is a new list of integers with length greater than 1; `n` must be greater than `i`; `i` is either 3 or 4; `num` is `ar[i]`; if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is `ar[2]`.**
