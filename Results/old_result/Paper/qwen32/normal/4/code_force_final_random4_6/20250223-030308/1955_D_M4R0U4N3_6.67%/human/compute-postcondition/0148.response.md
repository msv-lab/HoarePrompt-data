The code snippet provided is `done = set()`. This line reassigns the `done` variable to be an empty set, regardless of its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is the second integer provided by the input; `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`; `k` is the third integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input; `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the sliding window that were not in `todo` initially and have not been moved to `done` or `todo` during the loop; `j` is `m-1`; `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.**
