To determine what will be printed by the `print(n)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state:

1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
2. `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
3. `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
4. `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer from `l`, specifically `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`.
5. `i` is incremented by 1.

The `print(n)` statement will output the value of `n`. The value of `n` is explicitly stated to be an integer read from the input, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state.

Thus, the output of the `print(n)` statement will simply be the value of `n` as it was read from the input.

Output: **n (where n is the integer read from the input)**
