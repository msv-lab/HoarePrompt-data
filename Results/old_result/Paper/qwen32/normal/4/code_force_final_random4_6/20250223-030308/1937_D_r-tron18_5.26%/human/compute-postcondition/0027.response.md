To determine the output state, we need to focus on the execution of the line `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. This line calculates the value of `oneInd` based on the function `func_1`, which takes `preOne` and `zr` as arguments. However, the definition and behavior of `func_1` are not provided in the initial state.

We can only provide the output state in terms of the function call `func_1`. Let's assume `func_1(preOne, zr)` returns some value `X`. Therefore, `oneInd` will be `2 * X`.

Given this, the output state will be:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0, n]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[n - 1]` (which is either '<' or '>'), `el` is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `1`, `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

In natural language, the value of `oneInd` is now `2` times the result of the function `func_1` called with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments. All other variables retain their initial values.
