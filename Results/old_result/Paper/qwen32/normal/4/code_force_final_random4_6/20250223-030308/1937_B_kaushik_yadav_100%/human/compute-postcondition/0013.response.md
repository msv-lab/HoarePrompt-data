Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a`; `i` is 0 and `i + 1 < len(a)`; `b[i] < a[i + 1]`; `work` is False.**

In simple terms, the value of `work` has been changed to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
