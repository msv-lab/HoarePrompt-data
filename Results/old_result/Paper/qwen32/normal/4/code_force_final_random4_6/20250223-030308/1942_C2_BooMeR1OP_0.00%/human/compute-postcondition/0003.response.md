The code snippet provided sorts the list `a`. Given the initial state, the list `a` contains integers, each of which is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`. After sorting, the list `a` will be in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.**
