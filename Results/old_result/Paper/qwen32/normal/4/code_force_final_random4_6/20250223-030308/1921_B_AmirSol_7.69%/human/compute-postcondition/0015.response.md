Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is either 1 or 2 with specific conditions on the characters around `i` if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `i` is 1 with `s1[i]` equal to `s2[i]`, `counter` is either 1 or 2 based on the conditions mentioned.**

Explanation: The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. If `counter` was initially 0, it becomes 1. If `counter` was initially 1, it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
