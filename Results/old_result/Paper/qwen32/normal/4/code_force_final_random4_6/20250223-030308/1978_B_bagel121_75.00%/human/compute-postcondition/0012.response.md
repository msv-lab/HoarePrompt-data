The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer greater than 1, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. However, the code snippet does not modify `t`, and it only updates `n`, `a`, and `b` based on the input.

Since the code snippet only reads the input and assigns it to `n`, `a`, and `b`, the values of these variables are now set to whatever was provided in the input. The variables `t`, `ans`, `p2`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.**
