The code snippet `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so `a[j]` is `a[1]`.

Let's update the state based on this:

- If `a[1]` was not already in `done`, it will be added. 
- If `a[1]` was already in `done`, the set `done` remains unchanged because sets do not allow duplicate elements.
- The variable `ans` is not affected by this operation as it tracks the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, and no loop is indicated in the provided code snippet.
- The sets `todo` and `extra` remain unchanged.
- The variable `j` remains 1.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged.
- The variable `m` remains unchanged.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input, excluding `a[1]` if `a[1]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing the element `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` remains an empty set, and now also contains `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not already in `done`; `extra` is an empty set if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `extra` contains the integer `a[0]`; `j` is 1; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`.**
