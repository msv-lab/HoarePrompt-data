Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `j` is an input integer + 2.
   - `t` is `t - 1` (Note: `t` is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for this output).
   - `sum` is \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\) (Note: `sum` is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for this output).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

Let's analyze each part of the print statement:

- The first argument is the integer `2`.
- The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Since `j` is defined as an input integer plus 2, we can denote the input integer as `input_j`. Therefore, `j = input_j + 2`. Thus, `n - j + 1` becomes `n - (input_j + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - input_j - 1`.
- The third part is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which will print numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Now, let's put it all together:

- The first value printed is `2`.
- The second value printed is `n - input_j - 1`.
- The third part will print the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

**Output:**
Output: **2, n - input_j - 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where input_j is the input integer used to calculate j, and n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
