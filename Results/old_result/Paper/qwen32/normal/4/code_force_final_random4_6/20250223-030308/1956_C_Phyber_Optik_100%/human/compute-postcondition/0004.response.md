To determine the state required for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate from 2 to `n + 1`, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is not explicitly defined in the loop syntax, but it will be set to 2 at the start of the first iteration.

Given the provided state before the loop starts, we need to adjust it to ensure the loop can execute. The state `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, but it is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution. The variable `sum` is also not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is at least 2, so the loop can execute from 2 to `n + 1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` must be at least 2, `sum` is 1**
