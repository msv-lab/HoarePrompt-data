The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `m` are input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was encountered in `s` and `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is the bitmask of characters encountered in the final segment of `s` that did not complete a sequence of `k` distinct characters, `i` is 2. If the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'b'. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string. `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.**
