Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in one move.
- Given `n` moves and `m` cubes, determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes at the end.
- The output should be "Yes" or "No" (case-insensitive).

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `b == c`**
   - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the number of cubes `c`, the program outputs "YES".
   - This is correct because if `b` moves are all additions, it's possible to have `c` cubes.

2. **Case 2: `b < c`**
   - If the number of moves `b` is less than the number of cubes `c`, the program outputs "NO".
   - This is incorrect because if `b` is even and greater than or equal to `c`, it's possible to add `c` cubes and then remove `(b - c)` cubes to still have `c` cubes.

3. **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
   - If the number of moves `b` and the number of cubes `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program outputs "Yes".
   - This is correct because starting from 0 cubes, an even number of moves can result in an even number of cubes, and an odd number of moves can result in an odd number of cubes.

4. **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**
   - If the number of moves `b` and the number of cubes `c` have different parities, the program outputs "No".
   - This is correct because an even number of additions/removals cannot result in an odd number of cubes, and vice versa.

### Incorrect Case:
The program incorrectly handles the case where `b < c`. Specifically, if `b` is even and greater than or equal to `c`, it should be possible to end up with `c` cubes by adding `c` cubes and then removing `(b - c)` cubes.

### Example of Incorrectness:
- Input: `2 1`
- Expected Output: "Yes" (Nikita can add 1 cube and then remove 1 cube to have 1 cube at the end).
- Actual Output: "NO"

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the handling of the case where `b < c`.

Correctness: **False**.
