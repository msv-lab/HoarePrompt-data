The code snippet initializes a list `suff` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000; `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, where each element in `a` and `b` is between 1 and 10^9, inclusive; `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, all initialized to 0.**
