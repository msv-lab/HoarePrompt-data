The code snippet sorts the `coord` list. This will change the order of the tuples in `coord` based on their default tuple comparison, which compares the first element of each tuple, and if they are equal, compares the second element, and so on.

Given the initial state, `coord` is a list of four tuples representing coordinates. After sorting, the order of these tuples may change, but the values within each tuple remain the same. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a sorted list of [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2; `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2.**

In simpler terms, the coordinates in `coord` are now sorted, but the other variables remain unchanged.
