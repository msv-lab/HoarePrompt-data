Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters, an integer `n` representing the length of the string `s`, and an integer `x` used as an index to identify a point in the string `s` where the character differs from the first character of `s`. The function does not return any value in Case_1, and in Case_2, it returns `None`.**
