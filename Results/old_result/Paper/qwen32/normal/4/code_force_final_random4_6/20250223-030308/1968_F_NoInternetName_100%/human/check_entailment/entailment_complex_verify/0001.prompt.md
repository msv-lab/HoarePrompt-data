You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

    #The program returns a map object that applies the function 'cast' to each element of the list created by splitting the input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a callable `cast` as an argument and returns a map object that applies the `cast` function to each element of a list created by splitting an input string.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate` that returns a boolean. It returns the largest index `l` in `arr` for which `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. If no such index exists, it returns `None`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It calls another function `func_2` with these parameters. If `func_2` returns a non-None value, the function attempts to add 1 to this value and return it, which could lead to a TypeError if the returned value is not an integer. If `func_2` returns `None`, or if a TypeError occurs, the function returns `None`.

For each query, it determines whether there exists a subarray `a[l-1:r]` whose XOR is zero and prints "Yes" if such a subarray exists, otherwise it prints "No".




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided Python program is correct, let's analyze the logic and implementation step by step.

### Problem Analysis
We need to determine if a given subarray can be split into more than one part such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same. The main idea is to use prefix XOR values to check if such a division is possible.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `a`, and the queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array `a` and stores it in the list `x`.
   - It also maintains a dictionary `inds` that maps each prefix XOR value to the indices where this prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `a[l-1:r]` can be split into parts with equal XOR.
   - If `x[l-1] == x[r]`, it means the entire subarray has a XOR of 0, which implies it can be split into any number of parts with XOR 0. Hence, the answer is "Yes".
   - If `x[l-1] != x[r]`, it uses the indices stored in `inds` to find if there exists an index `lower` such that `inds[x[r]]` has an index less than `l` and an index `upper` such that `inds[x[l-1]]` has an index less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper > lower`, it means there exists a point in the subarray where the prefix XOR can be split into two parts with the same XOR, hence the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, the answer is "No".

### Functions Explanation
- **func_1:** Reads a line of input and converts it to a list of integers.
- **func_2:** Binary search to find the largest index in `arr` where the `predicate` is true.
- **func_3:** Calls `func_2` to find the largest index in `arr` where the `predicate` is true.
- **func_4:** Calls `func_2` and adjusts the result by adding 1. It returns `None` if no such index is found.
- **func_5:** Main function that processes each test case, reads the array, computes the prefix XOR, and processes each query.

### Correctness Verification
- The program correctly computes the prefix XOR values.
- The use of binary search in `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` ensures that the indices are found efficiently.
- The logic for checking the subarray's XOR properties is correct.
- The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
The provided program seems to implement the solution correctly based on the analysis. It efficiently handles the queries and checks the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

Correctness: **True**
