Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed.

- `s` is the user input string.
- `n` is the length of the user input string.
- `x` is -1.
- `func_1(s[0:])` evaluates to False.

The `print(s)` statement is instructed to print the variable `s`, which is the user input string. The other variables (`n`, `x`, and the result of `func_1(s[0:])`) are not directly used in the `print(s)` statement and therefore do not affect the output.

Given that `s` is the user input string, the output will be exactly what the user provided as input.

Output: **s (where s is the user input string)**
