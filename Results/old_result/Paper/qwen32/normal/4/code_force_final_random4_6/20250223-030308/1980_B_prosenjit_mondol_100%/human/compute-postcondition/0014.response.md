Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `k` is the third integer from the input minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order, `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is strictly less than `x`, then `a[k]` is strictly less than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is equal to `x`.**
