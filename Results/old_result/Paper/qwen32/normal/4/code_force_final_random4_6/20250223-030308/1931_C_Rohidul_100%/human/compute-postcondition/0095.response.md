Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `a` to ensure that the remaining list does not have the same starting and ending elements, unless the entire list is uniform.**
