Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. The sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd. The loop continues to the next iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. The precondition that `t` is greater than or equal to 1 and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd remains valid.
