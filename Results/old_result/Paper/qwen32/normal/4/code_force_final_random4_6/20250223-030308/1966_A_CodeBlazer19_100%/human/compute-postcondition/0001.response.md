In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `i`, and it iterates over the range defined by `t`. The loop will execute `t` times if `t` is greater than or equal to 1. According to the problem statement, `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `t` is within this range.

Since `t` is already defined within the required range and no other variables in the loop head (`i` is just the loop variable and does not need to be pre-initialized), no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
