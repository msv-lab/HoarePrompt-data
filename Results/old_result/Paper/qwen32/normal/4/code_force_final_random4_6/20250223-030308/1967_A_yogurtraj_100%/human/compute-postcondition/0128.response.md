Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `ii` is 2; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input; `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `k` is 0; `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `r` is `a[n - 1]`; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0.**
