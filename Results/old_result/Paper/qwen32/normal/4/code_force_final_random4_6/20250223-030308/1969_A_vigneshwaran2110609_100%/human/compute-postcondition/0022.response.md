`x` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the total number of iterations, and `x` is an input integer.
Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the total number of iterations, `x` is an input integer**.
