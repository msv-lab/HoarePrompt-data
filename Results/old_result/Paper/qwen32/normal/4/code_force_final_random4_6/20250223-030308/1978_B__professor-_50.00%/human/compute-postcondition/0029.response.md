Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n` multiplied by `a`. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2 * b - n + 1` with a common difference of `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference of `1`, plus `a * n`.**
