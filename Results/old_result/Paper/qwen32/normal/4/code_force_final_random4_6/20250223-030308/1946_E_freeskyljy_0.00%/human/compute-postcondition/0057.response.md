To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `i < N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `N`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `N`
- `N` is assigned the value from the input and is a constant for the current test case.

Since `i` is currently equal to `N`, the condition `i < N` is no longer satisfied, and the loop will not execute again with the current state. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` so that it is less than `N`.

### Steps to Adjust State:
1. **Adjust `i`**: Since `i` is currently `N`, we need to set `i` to a value that is less than `N`. The simplest choice would be `i = N - 1`.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- The sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n.
- `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n.
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input.
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `R` is a list of integers read from the input.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`.
- At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`.
- `nums_left` is -3.
- `M2` is greater than 1.
- `i` is `N - 1` (adjusted from `N` to ensure the loop condition is satisfied).
- If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is increased to 2. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * -1 % MOD` and `cur` remains 1. If `cur` was 1 and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `ans` is further updated to `ans * -2 % MOD`.
