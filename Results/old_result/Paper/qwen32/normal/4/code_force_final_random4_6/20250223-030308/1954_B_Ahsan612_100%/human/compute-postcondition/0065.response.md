To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition and the variables involved in it. The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 3.
- `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`.
- If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`.
- Otherwise, `i` is 5, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[4]`, and `minn` is 1.

The loop will execute again if `i < len(ar)`. The length of `ar` is `n` since `ar` has `n` elements.

Let's consider both scenarios for `i`:

1. If `i` is 2:
   - For the loop to execute again, `2 < n` must be true. Since `n` is already given to be greater than 3, this condition is satisfied. No adjustment is needed for `i` in this case.

2. If `i` is 5:
   - For the loop to execute again, `5 < n` must be true. Since `n` is greater than 3, `n` must be at least 6 for this condition to be satisfied. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 6.

Since the state of `i` can be either 2 or 5, we need to ensure that the loop can execute again for both scenarios. The critical adjustment is for the case when `i` is 5, where `n` must be at least 6.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is at least 6.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer and `n` must be at least 6; `ar` is a list of integers `[a1, a2, ..., an]` with `n > 1`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 2, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 5, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[4]`, and `minn` is 1**
