The code snippet provided updates the values of `c` and `r` by taking a new input of two integers separated by a space. The initial states of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. The value of `i` is mentioned to be `i + 1` in the initial state, but since there is no operation in the provided code that modifies `i`, it remains unchanged. Similarly, the condition for `num` (whether it is 2 or 4) is dependent on the values of `c` and `r` but is not recalculated or assigned in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space, and `k` must be greater than 0; `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the latest input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer separated by a space; `i` is `i + 1`. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4.**
