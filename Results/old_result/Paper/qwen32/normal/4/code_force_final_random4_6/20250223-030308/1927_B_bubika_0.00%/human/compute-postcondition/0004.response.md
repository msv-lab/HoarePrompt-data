The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `s`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The specific values of the integers in the list `s` depend on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers corresponding to the input values**.
