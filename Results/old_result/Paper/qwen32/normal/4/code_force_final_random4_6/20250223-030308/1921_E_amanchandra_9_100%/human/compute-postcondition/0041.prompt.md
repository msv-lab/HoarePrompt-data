Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4. Each of the `t` test cases is described by six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` where 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`. The sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if a > c:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(a - c) // 2
        if abs(a - c) % 2:
            l = max(1, d - x)
            r = min(w, d + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <=
                x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, b - x)
            r = min(w, b + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than `c`, no changes are made to `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is set to `abs(a - c) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a > c`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `x` is set to `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is not zero, `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is zero, `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a > c`, the program does not modify `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d` further. Otherwise, `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `r` is set to `min(w, b + abs(a - c) // 2)`; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`; `l` is `max(1, d - x)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `l` is `max(1, b - abs(a - c) // 2)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
