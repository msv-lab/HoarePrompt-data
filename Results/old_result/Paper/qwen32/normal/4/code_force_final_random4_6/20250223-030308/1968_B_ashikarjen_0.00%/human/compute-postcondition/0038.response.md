To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `j` and `b[j]`.

Here's the loop statement:
```
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `j < m`:**
   - Currently, `j` is 2.
   - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `j` needs to be less than `m`. Since `j` is currently 2, `m` must be greater than 2.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a[i]` is `a[0]` which is the first character of the binary string `a`.
   - `b[j]` is `b[2]` which is the third character of the binary string `b`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[0]`.

### Adjustments:
- We need to ensure `m` is greater than 2.
- We need to ensure `b[2]` is not equal to `a[0]`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `m` must be greater than 2; `a` is a non-empty binary string input; `b` is a non-empty binary string input such that `b[1]` is not equal to `a[0]` and `b[2]` is not equal to `a[0]`; `i` is 0; `j` is 2**

This ensures that the conditions for the `while` loop to execute one more time are met.
