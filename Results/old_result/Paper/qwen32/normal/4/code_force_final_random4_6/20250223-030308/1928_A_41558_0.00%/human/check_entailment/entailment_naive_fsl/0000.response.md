Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two and rearranging the pieces. Let's analyze the logic in the program and find a counterexample.

The program's logic is:
1. If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, print "NO".
2. If one dimension is exactly half of the other, print "NO".
3. Otherwise, print "YES".

However, this logic is flawed. Here are some counterexamples:

1. **Counterexample 1**: Rectangle with dimensions 3x4
   - The program will print "YES" because neither dimension is odd and one is not exactly half of the other.
   - However, cutting a 3x4 rectangle into two 3x2 rectangles can form a 2x6 rectangle, which is different from 3x4.

2. **Counterexample 2**: Rectangle with dimensions 5x4
   - The program will print "YES" because neither dimension is odd and one is not exactly half of the other.
   - However, cutting a 5x4 rectangle into two 5x2 rectangles can form a 2x10 rectangle, which is different from 5x4.

3. **Counterexample 3**: Rectangle with dimensions 6x3
   - The program will print "NO" because one dimension is exactly half of the other.
   - However, cutting a 6x3 rectangle into two 3x3 rectangles can form a 3x6 rectangle, which is different from 6x3.

The correct approach should be to check if the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. This can be achieved if at least one of the dimensions is even, as an even dimension can be split into two equal parts, and these parts can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
# func()
```
In this corrected version, the program checks if at least one of the dimensions is even. If so, it prints "YES", indicating that Bob can form another rectangle. Otherwise, it prints "NO". This logic correctly handles all cases as described in the problem statement.
