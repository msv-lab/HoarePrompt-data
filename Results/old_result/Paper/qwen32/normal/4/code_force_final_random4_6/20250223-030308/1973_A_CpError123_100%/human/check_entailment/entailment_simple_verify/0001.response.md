### Reasoning:

The original assessment carefully analyzes the problem and the provided program, validating the logic step by step. Let's further break down the reasoning to ensure accuracy:

1. **Even Total Points Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total points \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) are even. If they are not, it returns `-1` because an odd total is impossible given the scoring rules (each game contributes exactly 2 points, either through a win or a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula \( \text{min} \left( \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2}, p_1 + p_2 \right) \).
   - The term \( \frac{p_1 + p_2 + p_3}{2} \) represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points.
   - The term \( p_1 + p_2 \) represents the maximum number of draws involving the first two players, as the third player's score is at least as high as the second player's score.

3. **Validation with Examples**:
   - The original assessment validates the program with several examples, demonstrating that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws or identifies inconsistent scores.

### Detailed Validation:

Let's revisit the examples to ensure the logic holds:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{0}{2}, 0 \right) = 0 \)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{2}{2}, 1 \right) = 1 \)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{4}{2}, 2 \right) = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6**:
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{12}{2}, 7 \right) = 6 \)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7**:
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: \( \text{min} \left( \frac{12}{2}, 2 \right) = 2 \)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or identify inconsistent scores. The original assessment is accurate, and the program passes all the provided test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
