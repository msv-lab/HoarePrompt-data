The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the current index that has just finished executing. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4;
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0;
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input;
- `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`;
- `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set;
- `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set.

Since only `j` can be adjusted, we increment `j` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the input with `m` greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `todo` is a set of unique integers obtained from the input, except it no longer contains `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`; `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set; `j` is incremented by 1**
