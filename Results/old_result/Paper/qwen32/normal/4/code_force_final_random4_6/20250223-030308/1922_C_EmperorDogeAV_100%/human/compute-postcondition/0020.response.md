Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` if `i` was greater than 0 before the increment, otherwise `back` remains -99999999999999999999, and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`.**

In simpler terms: The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. If `i` was greater than 0 before the increment, `back` is now set to the city at the index `i - 1` in the `cities` list. If `i` was not greater than 0, `back` remains as -99999999999999999999. The variable `forward` is now set to the city at the index `i + 1` in the `cities` list.
