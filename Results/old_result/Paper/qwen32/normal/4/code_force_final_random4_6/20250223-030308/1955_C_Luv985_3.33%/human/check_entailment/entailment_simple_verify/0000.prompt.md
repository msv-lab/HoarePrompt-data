You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the number of attacks `k` is very large compared to the number of ships `n` and their durability. Let's identify a specific case where the program fails:

#### Problematic Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 15
1 5
```
#### Expected Output:
```
2
```
#### Explanation of Correctness:
- The Kraken attacks the first ship 1 time, reducing its durability to 0. Now, the list of ships is `[0, 5]`.
- The Kraken attacks the last ship 1 time, reducing its durability to 4. Now, the list of ships is `[0, 4]`.
- The Kraken attacks the first ship again, but it is already sunk, so it moves to the next available ship, which is the second ship.
- The Kraken attacks the second ship 1 time, reducing its durability to 3. Now, the list of ships is `[0, 3]`.
- This process continues until the second ship's durability is reduced to 0. Since the Kraken attacks 15 times in total, and the second ship has a durability of 5, it will take 5 attacks to sink the second ship.
- After the second ship is sunk, there are no more ships left to attack, so the Kraken stops. The total number of ships sunk is 2.

#### Program Behavior:
The provided program does not correctly handle this scenario. Specifically, the logic for handling the case when `l == r` (i.e., when there is only one ship left) is flawed. The program attempts to break out of the loop prematurely when `mi * 2 <= k` is not met, which can result in incorrect calculations of the number of ships sunk.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when the number of attacks `k` is large and the number of ships `n` is small. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
