The code snippet reassigns the value of `n` to be the length of the string `s` and sets `x` to `-1`. The initial state specifies that `s` is the user input string and `n` is the length of the user input string. The value of `n` is recalculated, and `x` is explicitly set to `-1`. The precondition that `s` is the user input string remains valid.

Output State: **`s` is the user input string, `n` is the length of the user input string, `x` is -1.**
