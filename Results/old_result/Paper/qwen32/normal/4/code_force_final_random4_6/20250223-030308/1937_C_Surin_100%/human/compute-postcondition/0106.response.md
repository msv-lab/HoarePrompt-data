The code snippet provided is `prev = i`. This line of code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `i`. Therefore, we can only update the state of `prev` to reflect that it now holds the value of `i`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is some value, `prev` is `i`, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the value provided by the user, and `r` equals `'>'`.**
