Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000. (This variable `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.)
2. `n` is an input integer. (The value of `n` is not directly used in the provided code snippet either, so we can ignore it for this task.)
3. `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with all leading zeros and trailing zeros removed.
4. `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
5. `res` is the total number of `0`s in the list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `res` is defined as the total number of `0`s in the list `a`.
- Since `a` is a list with all leading and trailing zeros removed, it means `a` does not contain any leading or trailing zeros. However, it can still contain zeros in between the elements.
- The value of `res` will be the count of zeros that are present in the list `a` after removing the leading and trailing zeros.

### Output:
The `print(res)` statement will output the number of zeros present in the list `a` after removing any leading and trailing zeros.

Output: **res (where res is the total number of 0's in the list `a` after removing leading and trailing zeros)**
