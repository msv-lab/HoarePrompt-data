The only variable in the loop head is `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `queue` is empty, which means the loop cannot execute again. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make `queue` non-empty.

State: **`queue` must not be empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes, `current` is the last node processed, `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged**
