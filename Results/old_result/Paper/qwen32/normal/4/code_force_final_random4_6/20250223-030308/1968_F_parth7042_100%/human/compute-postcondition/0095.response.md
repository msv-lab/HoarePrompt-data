The code appends `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]` in the `mp` dictionary. Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `pf[i]` was already calculated and exists in `mp` (either as `[0, i]` if it was `0` before or as `[i]` if it was not `0` before), the list associated with `pf[i]` in `mp` will now include `i` at the end.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 0, decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` and must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 2` elements where the first `n + 1` elements are zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[index])` and `a[n + 1]` is also `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `7 + 2 * n + 1`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` now contains `[0, i]` if `pf[i]` was `0` before, or `[i]` if `pf[i]` was not `0` before, and now includes `i` at the end; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is `n + 1`.**
