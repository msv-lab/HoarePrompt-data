The code appends the index of the last element of the list `x` to the list stored in `inds` under the key `x[-1]`. Given that `x[-1]` is `i` (the second element in the list `a`), the index `len(x) - 1` is `3` (since `x` has four elements, and Python uses 0-based indexing).

Therefore, the list `inds[i]` will have an additional element `3` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`; `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least two elements; `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; `x` is a list containing elements `[0, i, 0, i]`; `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[3]`; `i` is the second element in the list `a`.**
