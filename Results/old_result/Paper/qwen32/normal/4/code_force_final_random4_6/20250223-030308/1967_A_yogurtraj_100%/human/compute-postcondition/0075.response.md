Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`, `rem` is `k % 4`, `y` is `n - 4`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
