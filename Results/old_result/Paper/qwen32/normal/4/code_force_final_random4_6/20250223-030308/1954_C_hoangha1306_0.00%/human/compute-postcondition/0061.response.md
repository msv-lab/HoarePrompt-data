The only variable in the loop head is `q` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `q` and `t`. If `q` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is the current iteration index, and `t` is the total number of iterations.

Since the loop is iterating `t` times and `q` is the loop variable that increments with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `q` should be incremented by 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

State: **`kq1` and `kq2` are strings built based on the comparison of `a` and `b` as described, `vt` is 1 if there was at least one mismatch, otherwise 0, `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of the last compared characters, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `q` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `q` should be `i + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can simply say `q` is incremented by 1.
