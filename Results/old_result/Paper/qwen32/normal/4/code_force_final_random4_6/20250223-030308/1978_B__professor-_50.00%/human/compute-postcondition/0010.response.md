Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `b` is greater than `a`. If the difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`. Otherwise, the difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`.**
