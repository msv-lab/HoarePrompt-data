Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers; `i` is equal to the length of `ar`; `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `num` is the value of the last element in the list `ar` or the value of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal; `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of consecutive elements that are equal encountered during the loop, and `minn` is neither infinity nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
