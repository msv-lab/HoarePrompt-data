The code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to the element at index `left + i` in the array `cliquess`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**
