The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 3 because the loop starts from `3` and goes up to `m + 1`. The current state indicates that `m` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, but it does not specify that `m` must be at least 3. Therefore, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute.

The variable `i` is initialized to `k`, but since the loop starts with `i` equal to 3, we need to adjust `i` to 3 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space; `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`; `i` is equal to 3; `m` is equal to `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3; `dp` is a list with `m + 1` elements, all initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**
