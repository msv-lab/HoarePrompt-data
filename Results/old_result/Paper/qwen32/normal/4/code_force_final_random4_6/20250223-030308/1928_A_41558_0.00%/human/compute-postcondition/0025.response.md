Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input. If both `a` and `b` are odd, no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
