Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 4999; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is the first element of `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`; `q` is equal to `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
