The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1, `pos` will take the value of `i` after the increment. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `pos` is equal to `i`**.
