To determine the output state, we need to calculate the new value of `dp[i]` based on the given formula and then update the state accordingly. The formula for `dp[i]` is:

\[ dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \]

Given:
- `i` is 4
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` can be calculated using the formula for `i=3`:
  \[ dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (3 + 4) \% (10^9 + 7) = 7 \]

Now we use the formula to calculate `dp[4]`:
\[ dp[4] = (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) = (7 + 18) \% (10^9 + 7) = 25 \]

Thus, `dp[4]` is updated to 25. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the sum of increments from all iterations (either 1 or 2 per iteration), `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25, `i` is 4**
