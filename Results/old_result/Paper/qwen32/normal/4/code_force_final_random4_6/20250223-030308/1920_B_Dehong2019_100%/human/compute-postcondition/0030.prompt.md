Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list; `i` is `x-1`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    ans1 += a[i]
    if i + x < n:
        ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
    ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains the sum of the elements in `a` from the `x-th` element to the end of the list plus `a[0]`; `i` is 0; `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is 1. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is the previous `ans1` plus `a[1]` minus `a[1 + x] * 2` and `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans1` plus `a[1]`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged from their previous values; `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers where `k` is greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is 2. `ans2` is the maximum of the previous `ans1` and `ans1` plus `a[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
