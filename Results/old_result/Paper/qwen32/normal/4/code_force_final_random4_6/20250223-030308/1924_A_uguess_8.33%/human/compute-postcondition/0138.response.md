The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns to `tmp` the character that is `i` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table. Given that `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only express `tmp` in terms of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered consecutively, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character `chr(ord('a') + i)`, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times. Additionally, the current value of `cur` has the `i`-th bit unset (i.e., `cur & 1 << i == 0`).**
