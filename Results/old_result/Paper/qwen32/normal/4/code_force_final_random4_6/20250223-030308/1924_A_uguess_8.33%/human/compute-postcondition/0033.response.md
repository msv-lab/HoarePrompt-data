The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `cur`), but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables. It directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('NO')` statement is executed.
2. The string `'NO'` is directly outputted to the console, as there are no variables or expressions within the `print` statement that require evaluation.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not involve any of the variables described in the initial state, the output is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
