The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that the set `s` now includes the element `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is an empty set containing `arr[i]`, `i` is either 1 if `n` was 2, or the last index reached before the loop ended, and `ans` is either 0 or 1**.
