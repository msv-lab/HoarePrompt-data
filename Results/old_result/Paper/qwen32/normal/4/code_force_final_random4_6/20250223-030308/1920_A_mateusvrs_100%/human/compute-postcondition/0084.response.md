The code snippet provided is:

```
tmp = 0
```

This line of code assigns the value `0` to the variable `tmp`. None of the other variables (`ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3, `r` remains unchanged as `[0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 0.**
