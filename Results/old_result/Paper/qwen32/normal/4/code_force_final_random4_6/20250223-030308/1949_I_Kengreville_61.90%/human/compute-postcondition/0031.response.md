The code snippet `c0 += coef0[j]` updates the value of `c0` by adding `coef0[j]` to it. Given the initial state, `c0` is already updated to `c0 + coef0[j] + coef0[j]`, and now it is being updated again by adding `coef0[j]`. Therefore, the new value of `c0` will be `c0 + coef0[j] + coef0[j] + coef0[j]`, which simplifies to `c0 + 3 * coef0[j]`.

The values of `nodes`, `c1`, and `j` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`nodes` is a list that contains at least two elements, `c0` is updated to `c0 + 3 * coef0[j]`, `c1` is updated to `c1 + 2 * coef1[j]`, `j` is the second element in `nodes`**.
