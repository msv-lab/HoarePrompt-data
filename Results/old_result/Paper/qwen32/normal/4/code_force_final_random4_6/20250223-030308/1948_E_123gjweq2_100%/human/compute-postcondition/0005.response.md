The code modifies the element at the index `left + mid - i - 1` in the array `arr` by setting it to `small_element + i`. Given the initial state, the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is updated to `left + 1 + i`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `i` is 0, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`.**
