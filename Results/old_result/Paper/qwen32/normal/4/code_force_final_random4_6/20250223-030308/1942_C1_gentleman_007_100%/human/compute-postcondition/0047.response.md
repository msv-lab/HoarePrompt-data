The code snippet `q.append(node)` adds the `node` to the end of the list `q`. Given the initial state, if `not vis[node]` was true, `q` would have one more element which is `node` after the execution of the code. If `vis[node]` was false, it would now be true after the node was added to `q` and marked as visited. However, since the code snippet only includes `q.append(node)`, it only affects `q` directly, and does not explicitly change `vis[node]` in the provided code.

Output State: **`ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `q` has one more element which is `node`, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 for all vertices that are reachable from the initial `ver` including `node`, and `vis[node]` is 1. `graph[ver]` must contain at least one more element, and `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`.**

In simpler terms: The queue `q` now includes `node` at the end, and `node` is marked as visited in `vis`. All other conditions remain the same.
