The function `func_18` accepts a sorted list of integers `p` and an integer `x`. It returns the largest index `mid` such that `p[mid]` is less than or equal to `x` and `p[mid + 1]` is greater than `x`, if such an index exists. If `x` is less than the smallest element in `p`, the function returns -1.
