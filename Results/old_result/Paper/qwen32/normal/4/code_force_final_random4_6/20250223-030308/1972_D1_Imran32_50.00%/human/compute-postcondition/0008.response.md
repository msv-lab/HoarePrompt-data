Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^6); `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6); `ans` is `n + (n + i) // cnt + (n + (i + 1)) // (i * i + 2 * i + 1)`; `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`; `cnt` is `i * i`; `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + (i + 1)) // (i * i + 2 * i + 1)` to its previous value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `cnt` remains `i * i` from the previous state. All other variables are unchanged.
