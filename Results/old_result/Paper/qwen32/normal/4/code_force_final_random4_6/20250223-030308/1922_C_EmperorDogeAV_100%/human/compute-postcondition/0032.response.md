The code snippet sets the value of `prog_cities[i]` to 1. Given that `i` is 3, the value at index 3 of the `prog_cities` list will be updated to 1. The other variables (`n`, `back`, and `forward`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` remains the same. If `i < n - 1`, `back` is set to `cities[2]` and `forward` is set to `cities[4]`. Otherwise, `back` is set to `cities[2]` and `forward` remains 999999999999999999. `prog_cities[3]` is 1.**
