The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `num`, which is an iteration variable that takes on the values of each element in the list `a` during each iteration. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element.

The state of `n`, `a`, `res`, and `count` provided before the loop starts is already mostly sufficient for the loop to execute, except for the need to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element. Given that `n` is defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), the list `a` should already have at least one element (since the minimum value of `n` is 1). However, to be explicit and adhere to the requirement of only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we can restate the condition for the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31 and `a` must have at least one element, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary**.

Since the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) already ensures that `a` has at least one element, the state can be simplified to:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary**.
