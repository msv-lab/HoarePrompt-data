The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The values of `ans1`, `ans2`, and `ans` are not affected by this code, and `t` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of elements from index `x` to `x + k - 1` if they exist; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans` is the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input.**
