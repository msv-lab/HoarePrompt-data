The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. Since `_` does not affect the program state within the loop, it does not need to be adjusted based on the conditions described. The loop will execute `t` times, and the value of `_` will simply increment from 0 to `t-1`.

Given that the loop head does not contain any variables that need to be adjusted based on the program state, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except for the increment of the loop variable `_`.

State: **`ax` is the smallest value from constraints of type 2, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, and `cx` is a set of all unique values from constraints of type 3. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the list `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]`. If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the list `r` is `[0, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[ax - bx + 1 - tmp, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the initial conditions, and `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**
