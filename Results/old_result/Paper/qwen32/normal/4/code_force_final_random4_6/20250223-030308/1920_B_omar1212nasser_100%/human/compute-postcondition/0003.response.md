The code snippet assigns `s2` the value of the sum of the last `negatives` elements of the `elements` list. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`); `pos` is a list containing one element, which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`; `s` is the sum of `elements`; `s2` is the sum of `elements[-negatives:]`.**
