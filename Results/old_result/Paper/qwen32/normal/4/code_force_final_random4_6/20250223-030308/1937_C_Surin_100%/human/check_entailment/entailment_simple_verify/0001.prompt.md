You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to find indices `i` and `j` in the permutation `p` such that `p_i XOR p_j` is maximized. The XOR operation between two numbers returns a number with bits set to 1 where the corresponding bits of the operands differ. To maximize XOR, we want to find two numbers with the most differing bits.

The program uses queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation. By strategically choosing pairs, it aims to identify the two numbers that maximize the XOR.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum OR Value**:
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and compares `p[v1] OR p[v1]` with `p[i] OR p[i]` for each `i`.
   - If `p[v1] OR p[v1] < p[i] OR p[i]`, it updates `v1` to `i`.
   - This loop effectively finds an index `v1` where the value `p[v1]` has a high OR value, which is a good starting point for maximizing XOR.

3. **Finding the Best Pair for Maximum XOR**:
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and compares `p[v1] OR p[i]` with `p[v1] OR p[prev]`.
   - If `p[v1] OR p[i] > p[v1] OR p[prev]`, it updates `prev` to `i`.
   - If `p[v1] OR p[i] = p[v1] OR p[prev]`, it performs an additional comparison between `p[i] OR p[i]` and `p[prev] OR p[prev]` to decide whether to update `prev` to `i`.
   - This loop aims to find an index `prev` such that `p[v1] XOR p[prev]` is maximized.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the indices `prev` and `v1` as the pair that maximizes the XOR.

### Correctness

The program's logic is based on the idea that the maximum XOR can be found by comparing OR values. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the maximum XOR in all cases. The program might not correctly identify the pair with the maximum XOR, especially if there are multiple pairs with similar OR values but different XOR values.

### Conclusion

While the program attempts to find a good pair, it does not guarantee that it will find the pair with the maximum XOR for all possible permutations. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
