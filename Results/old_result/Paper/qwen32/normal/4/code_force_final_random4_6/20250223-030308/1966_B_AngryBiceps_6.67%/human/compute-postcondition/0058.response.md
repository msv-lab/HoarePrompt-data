The code snippet provided sets `last_row` to an empty string. This change affects the `last_row` variable directly, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of identical characters and is not the same as the last string in `a`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
