Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3`; `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`**

Natural language explanation: The value of `x` has been incremented by 1, so `x` is now 1. All other conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
