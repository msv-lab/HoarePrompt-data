The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement directly prints the integer `2` to the console. The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it is explicitly printing the number `2`.

Therefore, the output of the code is simply the number `2`.

Output: **2**
