Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `num_tests` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `x` is `x + 1`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `start_year` is recalculated to be `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. The value of `x` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
