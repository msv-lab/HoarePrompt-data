Let's analyze the given task step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `n`: The first integer from the input.
   - `m`: The second integer from the input.
   - `temp`: Either -1 if the loop completes all iterations without finding an `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, or it is the index `i` where this condition was first met.
   - `ans`: A list containing the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations.
   - `a`: A sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
   - `b`: The first `m` elements of the sorted list of the next `m` integers from the input in reverse order.

2. **The code snippet:**
   ```python
   print(sum(ans))
   ```

3. **Understanding the `ans` list:**
   - `ans` is populated with the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for each index `i` from 0 up to `temp` (or `m-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking).
   - The loop continues until either `i` reaches `m-1` or the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met, at which point `temp` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.

4. **Summing the `ans` list:**
   - The `sum(ans)` computes the total of all the absolute differences stored in `ans`.
   - If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `ans` will contain `m` elements, each being `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `m-1`.
   - If the loop breaks at some index `i`, `ans` will contain `i+1` elements, each being `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from 0 to `i`.

Given this analysis, the output of the `print(sum(ans))` statement will be the sum of the absolute differences calculated and stored in the `ans` list based on the conditions described.

Output: **sum of the absolute differences stored in the `ans` list (where `ans` contains `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations)**
