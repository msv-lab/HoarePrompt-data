The variable `i` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `counter` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0.**
