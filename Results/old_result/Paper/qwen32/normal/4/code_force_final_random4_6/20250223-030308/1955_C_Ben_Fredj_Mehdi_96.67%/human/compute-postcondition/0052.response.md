The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'5'`. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, etc.), but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'5'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is: `print('5')`.
2. This statement explicitly prints the string `'5'`.
3. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, etc., do not affect the output of this statement because they are not used within the `print` statement.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'5'`.

Output: **5**
