The code snippet extracts the first element from the list `nums`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `num1`. The values of `n`, `t`, the tree edges, the starting node `u_1`, and the `numbers` list remain unchanged. The `nums` list is also unchanged since only an element from it is read and not modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is an empty list; `nums` is a list of strings; `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`.**
