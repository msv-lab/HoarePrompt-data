Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
    if upper > lower:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `q` is greater than 0, `lower` is an integer determined by the indices in `inds[x[r]]` and the condition `arg < l`, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, then `upper` is greater than `lower`. Otherwise, `upper` is not greater than `lower`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `q` is greater than 0, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`, `i` is `i + 1`, `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`. If `upper > lower`, the state of the variables remains as described. Otherwise, the state of the variables also remains as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1`; `l` and `r` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`; `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`; `upper` is `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. The relationship between `upper` and `lower` is such that if `upper > lower`, the condition is met; otherwise, the else part is executed, but the values of `i`, `l`, `r`, `lower`, and `upper` remain the same in both cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
