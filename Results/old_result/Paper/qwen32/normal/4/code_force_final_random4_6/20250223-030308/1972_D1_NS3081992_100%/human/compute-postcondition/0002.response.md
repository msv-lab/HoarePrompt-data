The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a variable that we do not intend to use. However, the loop's execution depends on the return value of `func_10()`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `func_10()` returns a value that allows the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `func_15()` has been called, and its return value has been printed. However, the value returned by `func_15()` does not affect the loop's execution directly. The loop's execution is determined by the value returned by `func_10()`.

Let's denote the return value of `func_10()` as `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have executed `x` times, and `x` would have been decremented to 0 to terminate the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a value that is at least 1.

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that `func_10()` returns a value of at least 1. Since we do not have control over the internal workings of `func_10()`, we can only assume that the necessary conditions for `func_10()` to return a value of at least 1 are met.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and a positive integer value from `func_15()` has been returned and printed, and `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1**.
