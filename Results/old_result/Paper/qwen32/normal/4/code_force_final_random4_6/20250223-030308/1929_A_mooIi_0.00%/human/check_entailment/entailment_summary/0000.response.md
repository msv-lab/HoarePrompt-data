Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging. The program, however, only sorts the array in ascending order and prints it, which does not compute the beauty of the array. The correct approach would be to sort the array in ascending order (or descending order) and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Correctness: **False**
