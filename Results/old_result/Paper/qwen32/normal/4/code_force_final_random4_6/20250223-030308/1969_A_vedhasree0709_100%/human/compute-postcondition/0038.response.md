The code snippet provided is `j = 0`, which sets the variable `j` to 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.**
