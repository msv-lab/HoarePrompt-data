To determine what will be printed by the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the print statement itself. Let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is some value (its exact value is not provided).
- `n` is greater than 1 (its exact value is not provided).
- `r` is the value provided by the user (its exact value is not provided).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (this means `i` has been incremented somewhere in the code before this print statement, but its exact value before the increment is not provided).

### Print Statement:
```
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is a formatted string that includes the characters `?` followed by the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1` again, and `prev`.
- `v1` is referenced twice in the print statement, so its value will be printed twice.
- `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, so the value of `i` printed will be the value it had before the increment plus 1.
- `prev` is referenced once in the print statement, so its value will be printed once.

### Key Points:
- Since the exact values of `v1`, `i` (before increment), and `prev` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.
- `i` is incremented by 1 before the print statement, so the value printed for `i` will be `i + 1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the print statement will output the character `?`, followed by the value of `v1`, the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1, the value of `v1` again, and finally the value of `prev`.

Output: **? [v1] [i + 1] [v1] [prev] (where v1 is some value, i is incremented by 1 before this print statement, and prev is some value)**
