The code provided is `n = int(input())`, which means the variable `n` is reassigned to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`sum`, `j`, and `t`) are not directly affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `sum` is calculated as 1 plus the sum of (2i^2 - i) for i from 2 to n, where `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `t` is decremented by 1.

After the line `n = int(input())` is executed:
- The new value of `n` will be the integer input provided.
- `j` will now be the new `n + 1`.
- `t` will remain unchanged from its initial state (decremented by 1).
- `sum` will be recalculated based on the new value of `n` using the given formula.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is decremented by 1, `sum` is recalculated as 1 plus the sum of (2i^2 - i) for i from 2 to the new `n`.**
