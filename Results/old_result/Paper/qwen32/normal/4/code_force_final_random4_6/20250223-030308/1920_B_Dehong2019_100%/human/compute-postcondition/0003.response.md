The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state only provides information about `t`, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input.**
