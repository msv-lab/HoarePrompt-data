The code modifies the value of `start_year`. The new value of `start_year` is calculated based on its previous value and the value of `nums[x]`. The other variables (`x`, `nums`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `x + 1`, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `nums` remains unchanged**.

In natural language: The value of `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. The values of `x` and `nums` remain the same.
