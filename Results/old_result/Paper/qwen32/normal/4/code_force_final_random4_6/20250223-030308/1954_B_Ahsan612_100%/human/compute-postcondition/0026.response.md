Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is still less than `len(ar)`; `same` is increased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, and `i` remain as described in the initial state.
