Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is 0; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `k` is a positive integer minus `mi * 2`; `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`; if `a[l]` was 0, then `l` is 1, otherwise `l` remains 0; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before the operation; if `a[l]` was 0, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**
