The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This means that the values of `x` and `y` will change based on the input, but all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is [(x, y)] with the new tuple `(x, y)` appended; `res` is 0; `i` is 2; `p1` is \((coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])^2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1])^2\) if `coord` has at least 2 elements, otherwise `p1` remains unchanged; `p2` is \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\) if `coord` has at least 4 elements, otherwise `p2` remains unchanged; `x` and `y` are the new input integers.**
