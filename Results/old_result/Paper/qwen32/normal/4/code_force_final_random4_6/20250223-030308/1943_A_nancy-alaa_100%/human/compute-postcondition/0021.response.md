Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
2. **`n`**: An input integer that must be at least 0.
3. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained by splitting an input line and converting each split component to an integer.
4. **`mpp`**: A `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
5. **`first`**: A boolean variable.
6. **`i`**: Initially not defined explicitly, but it is incremented (`i = i + 1`), and if `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is incremented (`i = i + 1`), but its initial value is not specified. However, based on the context, it seems `i` is being used in some kind of loop or iteration process.
- The loop or if statement is broken out of if `i` is not a key in `mpp`. This means `i` must be a key in `mpp` at the point where the `print(i)` statement is executed.
- Since `i` is incremented and the loop continues until `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the `print(i)` statement will execute when `i` is the last key in `mpp` or when the loop condition is satisfied.

### Output:
Given the information, the exact value of `i` cannot be determined without the specific values of `arr` and the sequence of operations leading up to the `print(i)` statement. However, we can describe the printed value precisely based on the conditions given.

Output: **i (where i is the last key in the Counter object `mpp` that satisfies the loop condition)**
