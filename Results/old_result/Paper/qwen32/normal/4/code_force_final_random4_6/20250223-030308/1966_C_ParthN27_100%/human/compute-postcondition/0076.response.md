Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `arr`, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with a `0` prepended to it, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the value of `i` where the loop breaks, and `ans` is 0**
