Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is `0`, `i` is `b + 1`, `a` must be greater than `b + 1`, `b` is the first input integer, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, `e` is the fourth input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is either `e.index(d[j]) + 1` if the character at index `j` of `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, or `j` if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`. In both cases, `i` remains `b + 1`, `a` is greater than `b + 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `1`, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, and `e` is the fourth input string. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1` in the if part, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is either `e.index(d[j]) + 1` if the character at index `j` of `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, or `j` if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`. `i` is `b + 1`, `a` is greater than `b + 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `1`, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, and `e` is the fourth input string. `j` is `j + 1`. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is either `e.index(d[j]) + 1` if the character at index `j` of `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, or `j` if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`. `i` is `b + 1`, `a` is greater than `b + 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `1`, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, and `e` is the fourth input string. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
