Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob starts with a rectangle of size \(a \times b\). He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle. Then, he needs to determine if he can form a different rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.

### Key Observations:
1. **If either dimension is 1**:
   - If the rectangle is \(1 \times 1\), it cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles.
   - If the rectangle is \(1 \times b\) (or \(b \times 1\)), it can only be cut into \(1 \times 1\) pieces, which can only form a \(1 \times b\) (or \(b \times 1\)) rectangle, which is not different.

2. **If both dimensions are odd**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles will result in rectangles with at least one odd dimension. These smaller rectangles cannot form a new rectangle with integer sides that is different from the original rectangle.

3. **If one dimension is even**:
   - If one of the dimensions is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. These smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original rectangle.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the logic in the provided program:
- The program first reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
- It then checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If true, it prints 'NO'.
- It also checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`). If true, it prints 'NO'. However, this condition is incorrect because it doesn't cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.
- If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'YES'.

### Issues in the Program:
- The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` is incorrect. For example, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle, but the program would incorrectly print 'NO' for this case.
- The program correctly handles the case where both dimensions are odd, but the logic for handling other cases is flawed.

### Correctness:
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases where a new rectangle can be formed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
