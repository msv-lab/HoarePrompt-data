Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` must be greater than 0, `num` is 2, `m` is equal to `n - 2`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

Natural Language: The value of `num` has been incremented by 2, so `num` is now 2. Consequently, `m` is now equal to `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
