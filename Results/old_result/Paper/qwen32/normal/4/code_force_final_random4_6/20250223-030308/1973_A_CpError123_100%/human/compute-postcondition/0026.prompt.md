Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    x = (a + b + c) // 2
    y = a + b
    print(min(x, y))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `_` is the next iteration counter; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than or equal to 2; `_` is 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the new input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`. If `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0`, then `x` and `y` are updated using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their values based on the old values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
