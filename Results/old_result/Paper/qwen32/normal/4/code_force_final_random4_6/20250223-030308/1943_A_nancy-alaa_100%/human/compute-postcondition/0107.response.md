To determine the final output state after the loop completes all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it breaks. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n`, checking if the current `i` is a key in the `Counter` object `mpp` that counts the frequency of integers in the list `arr`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
2. **Key Check**: For each `i`, it checks if `i` is not a key in `mpp`. If `i` is not a key, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
3. **First Check**: If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, it checks if `first` is `True`. If `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
4. **First Assignment**: If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, it sets `first` to `True`.

The loop will break if:
- `i` is not a key in `mpp`.
- `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1 and `first` is `True`.

If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it means:
- All integers from `0` to `n` are keys in `mpp`.
- For each integer `i` from `0` to `n` that has a frequency of 1 in `mpp`, `first` was not `True` when `i` was encountered.

In this case, the loop will run for `n + 1` iterations without printing anything and breaking out. The final state will be:

- `n` remains the same.
- `arr` remains the same.
- `mpp` remains the same.
- `first` remains `False` if no integer with a frequency of 1 was encountered after the first occurrence of such an integer.
- `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `mpp` remains unchanged, `first` is `False` if no integer with a frequency of 1 was encountered after the first occurrence of such an integer, and `i` is `n + 1`.**
