### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the provided annotations and examples to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis Recap:
1. **Total Points**: The sum of the scores of the three players must be even because each game contributes exactly 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
2. **Maximum Draws**: The goal is to maximize the number of draws, which are scored as 1-1.
3. **Invalid Scores**: If the total points are odd, the scores are impossible to achieve with the given rules, and the output should be `-1`.

#### Program Logic Recap:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Odd Total Points Check**: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`.
3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**: The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula aims to maximize the number of draws by adjusting for the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.

#### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 0 (no games played)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 1 (one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the first and second player, one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 6 (all games could be draws)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the first and second player, one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Detailed Analysis of the Formula:
The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
\[
\text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
\]
- **Breakdown**:
  - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all players.
  - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: This term adjusts for the excess points that cannot be attributed to draws. If `v[2]` (the highest score) is more than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, the difference is the number of 2-0 outcomes, which cannot be draws.
  - Subtracting this term from the total points and dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and adheres to the problem constraints. The formula used ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly while accounting for any 2-0 outcomes. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
