Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. `a` is a list of integers.
3. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
4. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
5. `z` is incremented by 1.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('2')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('2')` statement is straightforward. It prints the string `'2'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `z`.

### Explanation:
- The value `'2'` is explicitly provided in the print statement.
- No computation or variable substitution is involved in this print statement.

### Output:
Based on the analysis, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
