### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program, the problem description, and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Assign distinct integers to vertices and create edges based on a specific condition. Then, partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
- **Condition for Edge**: An edge exists between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
- **Output**: 
  1. A permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\).
  2. The number of cliques.
  3. A partition of vertices into cliques.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Global Variables**:
   - The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are used in `make_array` without being defined as global. This will indeed lead to a `UnboundLocalError`. The function should take these arrays as parameters or define them within the scope of `func_1` and pass them to `make_array`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`. This is a reasonable heuristic but not necessarily the optimal number of cliques. For small \(k\), this might not be correct. For example, if \(k = 1\), each vertex should be its own clique.
   - The logic for `make_array` does not ensure that all pairs within a clique satisfy the edge condition. It simply fills the array with a sequence of numbers in ascending and descending order and assigns a clique number. This does not guarantee that the resulting graph respects the edge condition.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the results directly instead of returning them, which is not ideal for testing or further processing.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The summary for `make_array` is accurate in describing what the function does: it fills a portion of the array with numbers in a specific order and assigns clique labels.

#### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Global Variables Issue**: This is a critical issue. The program will not run as written due to the `UnboundLocalError`.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The heuristic for the number of cliques (`ceil(n / k)`) might not always yield the correct number of cliques, especially for small \(k\).
- **Clustering Logic**: The current logic in `make_array` does not ensure that the resulting graph is correctly partitioned into cliques according to the problem's condition.

### Conclusion:

Given the identified issues, particularly the `UnboundLocalError` and the incorrect clustering logic, the original assessment is accurate. The program is not correct as it stands.

**Final: False**
