The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Given the initial state, `i` was 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 2. All other conditions and variable states remain the same except for `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 1, `i` is 2, `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `i < n - 1`, `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`.**
