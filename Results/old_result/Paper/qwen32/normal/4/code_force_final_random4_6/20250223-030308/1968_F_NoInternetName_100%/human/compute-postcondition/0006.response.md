The code appends a new element to the list `x` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the variable `i`. Given that `x` initially contains a single element `0`, the new element appended will be `0 ^ i`, which simplifies to `i` because `0` XOR any number is the number itself.

The variables `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `inds` are not modified by the code snippet provided, so they retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are new integers returned by `func_1`, `a` is a new list of integers returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing elements `[0, i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]`.**
