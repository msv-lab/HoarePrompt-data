The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `_` are not altered by this code.

Given that `temp` initially contains the element `(q + r) % n`, after executing the code, `temp` will contain both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing at least one element; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as an integer; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '1' or '?'; `_` is incremented by 1; `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
