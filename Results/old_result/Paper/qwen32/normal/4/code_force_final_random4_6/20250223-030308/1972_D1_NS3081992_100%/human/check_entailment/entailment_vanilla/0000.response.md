Let's break down and analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Key Observations:
- For each pair (a, b), we need to check if \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\).
- This can be simplified by noting that for any pair (a, b), if \(d = \gcd(a, b)\), then \(a = dx\) and \(b = dy\) for some integers \(x\) and \(y\) with \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). The condition then becomes \(dx + dy \mod (dy \cdot d) = 0\), or \(x + y \mod (y \cdot d) = 0\).

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program contains multiple functions, but the relevant function to solve the problem is `func_15()` and `func_16()`. Here is the breakdown of the relevant parts:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_10()` reads an integer from the input.
   - `func_7()` reads two integers from the input.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - `func_16()` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_15()` for each test case.

3. **Logic in `func_15()`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates the number of valid pairs using the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - It accumulates these counts and returns the result minus 1.

### Correctness Check:
- The provided logic in `func_15()` seems to be based on a mathematical insight, but it does not directly implement the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\).
- The formula used in `func_15()` does not align with the problem's requirement of checking the gcd condition for each pair (a, b).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given conditions. It seems to use a different approach that may not be valid for the problem at hand.

**Correctness: False**
