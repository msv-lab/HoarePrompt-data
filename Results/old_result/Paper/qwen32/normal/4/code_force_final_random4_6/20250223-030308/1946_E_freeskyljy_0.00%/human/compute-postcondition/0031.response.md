To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of the variable `i` so that it remains greater than 1. The loop condition is `i > 1`, so we need to make sure that `i` is a value that satisfies this condition.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n
- `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input
- `R` is a list of integers read from the input
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`
- `L[0]` is equal to 1
- `R[0]` is equal to `N`
- At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`
- `M1` is greater than 1, `cur` is `M1 - 3` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` remains `M1 - 2`
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`
- `i` is `L[-1] - 3`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4
- If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is updated to `M1 - 3`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(ans * (nums_left + 1)) % MOD`

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 1. Given that `i` is `L[-1] - 3`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 3 > 1`, which simplifies to `L[-1] > 4`.

Since `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 4, to ensure that `i` is greater than 1, `L[-1]` should be at least 5. Therefore, we need to adjust `L[-1]` to be at least 5.
