Postcondition: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where `graph[ver]` must contain at least one adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is an empty deque, `vis[ver]` is 1, and `node` is a vertex such that `vis[node]` is 0.**
