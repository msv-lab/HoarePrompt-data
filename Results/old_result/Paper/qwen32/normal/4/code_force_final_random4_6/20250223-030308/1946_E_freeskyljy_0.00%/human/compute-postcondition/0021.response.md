Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `R` is a list of integers read from the input, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[0]` is equal to `N`, at least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`, `ans` is the result of `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`, `M1` is greater than 1, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2, and `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`**

The value of `ans` has been updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`. All other variables retain their previous values.
