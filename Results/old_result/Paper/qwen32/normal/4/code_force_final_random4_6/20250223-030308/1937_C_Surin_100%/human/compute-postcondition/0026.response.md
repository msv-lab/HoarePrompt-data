The code snippet assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Given the initial state, `v2` is equal to `i + 2`. Therefore, `v1` will also be equal to `i + 2` after the assignment. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 2`, `v2` is `i + 2`, `r` is the user input, `v1` is `i + 2`**.
