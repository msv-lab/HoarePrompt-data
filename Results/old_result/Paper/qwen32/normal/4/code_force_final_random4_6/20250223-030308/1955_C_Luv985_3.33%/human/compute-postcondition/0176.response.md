Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0 (and is now decreased by `mi * 2`), `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1, `a` is the list of integers from the input with the first element decreased by `mi` and the last element decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` (original) and `a[n-1]`. If `a[l] == 0`, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `l` remains 0. `r` is `n - 1`.**
