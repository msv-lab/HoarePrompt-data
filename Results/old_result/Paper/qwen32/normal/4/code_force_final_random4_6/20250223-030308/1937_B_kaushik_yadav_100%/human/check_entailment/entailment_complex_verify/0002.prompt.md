You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The first binary string a_11 a_12 ... a_1n consists of n characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'.

    #State: t is 0; n is an integer; a and b are the last input strings with no leading or trailing whitespace; ans is the final constructed string based on the conditions described; i is equal to len(a); work is a boolean flag that can be either True or False; j is len(a) - 1; counter is the final count based on the conditions in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings of equal length. For each test case, it constructs a new string based on specific conditions and prints this string. It then calculates and prints the number of consecutive positions starting from the beginning where the characters in the two binary strings are either the same or differ in a specific pattern.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: 
   - Find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by moving from the top-left to the bottom-right of a 2xN grid.
   - Count the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string.

2. **Movement Rules**:
   - The grasshopper can move either right or down.
   - It starts at (1, 1) and must end at (2, N).

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The string is formed by the sequence of numbers encountered in the path.
   - The smallest string is determined by comparing the sequences lexicographically.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two binary strings representing the grid rows.

2. **Constructing the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It iterates through the columns of the grid, starting from the first column.
   - It uses a flag `work` to determine whether to take the current element from the first row (`a`) or the second row (`b`).
   - If `work` is `True`, it appends the element from the first row to `ans`.
   - If the element in the second row is smaller than the next element in the first row, it switches to the second row by setting `work` to `False`.
   - The process continues until the end of the grid is reached.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The program initializes a counter to 1, assuming there is at least one valid path.
   - It iterates through the columns of the grid, starting from the first column.
   - If the next element in the first row is equal to the current element in the second row, it increments the counter.
   - If the next element in the first row is '0' and the current element in the second row is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
   - The process continues until the end of the grid is reached.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Lexicographical String Construction**:
   - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string seems correct. The program correctly switches rows when it finds a smaller element in the second row that can lead to a smaller lexicographical order.

2. **Path Counting**:
   - The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the smallest string is flawed.
   - The counter logic does not correctly account for all possible paths that can produce the smallest string.
   - Specifically, it does not consider all cases where the grasshopper can switch rows and still produce the smallest string.

### Example Analysis:
- For the second test case with `n = 4`, `a = "1101"`, and `b = "1100"`, the program outputs `11000` and `1`.
- However, the correct output should be `11000` and `1`, which is correct in this case, but the program's logic is not robust enough to handle all cases.

### Conclusion:
While the program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest string for the given examples, it fails to accurately count the number of paths that produce this string due to flawed logic.

**Correctness:** **False**
