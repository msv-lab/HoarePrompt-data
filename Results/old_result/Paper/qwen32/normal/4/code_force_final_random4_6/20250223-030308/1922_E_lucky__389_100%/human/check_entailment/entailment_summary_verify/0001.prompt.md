You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, where `X` is at least 2. It calculates the lengths of subsequences of powers of 2 that sum up to `X` and prints the number of such subsequences minus one, followed by the lengths of these subsequences (excluding the first one). If `X` is 2, it directly prints 1 and 0. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences. The program needs to handle multiple test cases and output either an array that satisfies the condition or -1 if no such array exists.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the value of \( X \). The goal is to construct an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

#### Key Points:
1. **Special Case for \( X = 2 \)**:
   - The program correctly handles this case by outputting an array of length 1 with a single element (0), which indeed has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.

2. **General Case for \( X > 2 \)**:
   - The program attempts to decompose \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2. This is based on the observation that if an array has elements that are strictly increasing in some positions and equal in others, the number of increasing subsequences can be related to the binary representation of \( X \).
   - For each power of 2 that fits into \( X \), the program subtracts that power from \( X \) and records the exponent.
   - It then constructs an array based on the exponents found. The array is constructed such that it has the required number of increasing subsequences.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Array Construction**:
  - The array construction logic is flawed. The program simply appends the exponents found to the array, but this does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
  - The approach should be more systematic in constructing the array to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences. For example, using repeated elements and ensuring that the subsequences are counted correctly.

- **Handling of Edge Cases**:
  - The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it does not ensure that the array length does not exceed 200.
  - The program should verify that the constructed array meets the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the array construction logic and the lack of verification of constraints, the program is not guaranteed to produce a correct solution for all valid inputs.
