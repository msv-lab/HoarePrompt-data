To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the condition in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```python
while n:
    # the loop body is omit
```

In Python, a non-zero integer is considered `True`, and a zero integer is considered `False`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is any integer other than 0.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an input integer.

The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we need to adjust `n` to ensure that it is not zero. Since `t` does not affect the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be any integer except 0. Given that `n` is an input integer, we can state that `n` must be adjusted to be any non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer**
