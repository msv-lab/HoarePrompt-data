Output State: **`kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with `a[i]`, `kq2` is `a[i]`, `vt` is 0, `x` and `y` are the last compared minimum and maximum values, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is `q + 1`, `a` is a sequence with at least one element, `b` is the user input, and the current element of `a` at index `i` is equal to the current element of `b` at index `i`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `kq1`, `kq2`, `vt`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and the current element of `a` and `b` at index `i` remain unchanged except for `q` which is incremented by 1.
