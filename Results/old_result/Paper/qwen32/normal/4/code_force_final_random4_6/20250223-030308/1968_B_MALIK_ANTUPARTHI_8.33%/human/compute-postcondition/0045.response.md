The `break` statement does not change any of the variable values; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `k`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between the variables also remain intact.

Output State: **`k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `b + 1`, `a` is greater than `b + 1`, `b` is greater than or equal to `1`, `c` is the second input integer, `d` is the third input string, `e` is the fourth input string, and the character at index `j` of `d` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`. Additionally, either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
