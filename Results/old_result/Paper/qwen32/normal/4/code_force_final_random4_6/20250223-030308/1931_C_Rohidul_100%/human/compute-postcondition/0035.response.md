Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start; `end` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from `l` to the end of the list. If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its original value, which is `le - max(st, end)`**

**Explanation:** The variables `l` and `r` have been updated to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. All other variables retain their initial values.
