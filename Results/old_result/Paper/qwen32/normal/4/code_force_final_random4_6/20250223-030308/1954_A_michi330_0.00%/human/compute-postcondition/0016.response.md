The `print('Yes')` statement in the provided code snippet will output the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `itest`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` because the print statement does not depend on any of these variables. The string to be printed is explicitly defined within the statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The variable `itest` is set to 2.
2. The variable `t` is at least 3.
3. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
