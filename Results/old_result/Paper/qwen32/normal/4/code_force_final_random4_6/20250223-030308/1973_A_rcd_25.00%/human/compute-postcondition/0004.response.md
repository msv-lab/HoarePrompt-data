The code snippet provided is a simple print statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, but these variables are not used in the print statement. The print statement is independent of the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Given that the print statement is `print(-1)`, it will output `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Output: **-1**
