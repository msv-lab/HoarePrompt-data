### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem requirements and the provided program in detail.

**Problem Requirements:**
1. We need to maximize the sum of an n x n matrix using at most 2n operations.
2. Operations can be of two types:
   - Type 1: Assign a row `i` with a permutation `p` such that `a[i, j] = p[j]`.
   - Type 2: Assign a column `i` with a permutation `p` such that `a[j, i] = p[j]`.

**Provided Program:**
The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and performs 2n operations by filling each row and each column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

**Analysis of the Provided Program:**

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is actually the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers. This is not the correct formula for maximizing the sum of the matrix.
   - The correct maximum sum can be achieved by filling each cell with the highest possible value in a permutation, which is `n`. Therefore, the maximum sum should be `n * n * n`.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program fills each row and each column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - This does not maximize the sum because each cell should ideally be filled with the highest value `n` to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The correct approach is to fill each row and column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This way, each cell will be filled with the value `n`, resulting in a maximum sum of `n * n * n`.

**Original Assessment:**
The original assessment correctly identifies that the sum calculation and the operations in the provided program are incorrect. The formula used for the sum is not the correct one for maximizing the sum, and the operations do not ensure that each cell gets the highest value possible.

**Conclusion:**
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.

### Final: **False**
