Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, and for each of the `t` test cases, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; at least one of `a` or `b` is even. Additionally, either `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a` is true, or neither `a / 2` equals `b` nor `b / 2` equals `a`.**
