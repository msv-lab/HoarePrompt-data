To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given formula and the conditions provided in the initial state.

The formula to be printed is:
\[ \text{print}\left(\text{int}\left(\frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\right)\right) \]

Let's break down the formula:
1. **\(2 \cdot b\)**: This is simply twice the value of \(b\).
2. **\(- n + 1\)**: This part subtracts \(n\) from the result of \(2 \cdot b\) and then adds 1.
3. **\(\cdot n\)**: The result from the previous step is then multiplied by \(n\).
4. **\(\frac{\cdot}{2}\)**: The result is divided by 2.
5. **\(\text{int}(\cdot)\)**: The final result is converted to an integer.

Given the conditions:
- \(t\) is the number of test cases and is at least 1.
- \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) are integers.
- \(b > a\).
- \(b - a \geq n\).

While \(t\) is the number of test cases, it does not affect the output of a single test case calculation. The values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) are specific to each test case, and we need to use them to compute the output for each test case.

Therefore, the output for each test case will be the integer value of the expression \(\frac{(2 \cdot b - n + 1) \cdot n}{2}\).

Since the exact values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value for a given \(n\) and \(b\).

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) (where n and b are integers such that b > a and b - a >= n)**
