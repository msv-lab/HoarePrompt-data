To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the input values and the number of iterations `t`.

The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration:
1. It reads a list `v` of three integers.
2. It checks if the sum of the elements in `v` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1`.
3. If the sum is even, it calculates `result` using the formula: `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` and prints `result`.

The output state after all iterations will be a series of printed values, either `-1` or the calculated `result`, based on the input values for each iteration.

Let's break it down:

- **Initial State**: We have `t` test cases, each with three integers `p_1, p_2, p_3` (where `0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30`).
- **Loop Execution**: For each of the `t` iterations, the program checks the sum of the input integers and either prints `-1` or calculates and prints `result`.

Given that the output state after the first 3 iterations involves the same logic, the final output state after all `t` iterations will be a series of `t` printed values, each determined by whether the sum of the input integers for that iteration is odd or even.

### Final Output State
The final output state after all iterations is a series of `t` printed values, where each value is either `-1` (if the sum of the input integers is odd) or the calculated `result` (if the sum is even).

**Output State: **a series of `t` printed values, each being either `-1` or the calculated `result` based on the input values for each iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is a sequence of `t` printed results, where each result is either `-1` if the sum of the input scores is odd, or a calculated value if the sum is even.
