### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, given the price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts on promotion).
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - It calculates the cost of buying all yogurts individually, `ans1 = a * n`.
     - It calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price, `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
     - It prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n` is 1, it directly prints the price of one yogurt, `a`.
3. **Output**: For each test case, the program outputs the minimum cost.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `9`

2. **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost: `14`

3. **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost: `15` (since `ans1 < ans2`)

4. **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `20`

The program's output matches the expected results for all the test cases in the example.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
