The code snippet modifies the value of `s2` by adding the element at the index `-(negatives + i)` from the list `elements`. The values of `removals`, `i`, `s`, and `s2` before this modification are given in the initial state. After executing the code, `s2` will be updated, but the other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`; `s2` is decreased by `elements[-i]` and then increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `removals` remains greater than 0, `i` has been incremented by 1, `s` has been decreased by the value of `elements[-i]`, and `s2` has first been decreased by `elements[-i]` and then increased by `elements[-(negatives + i)]`.
