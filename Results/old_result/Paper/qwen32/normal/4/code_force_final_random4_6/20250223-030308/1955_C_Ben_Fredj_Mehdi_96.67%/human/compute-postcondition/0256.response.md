Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `g` is decremented by 1, `a[d]` is decremented by 1, `z` is incremented by 1, `n` is decremented by 1, `k` remains at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `k // 2`. If `a[d]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If `a[g]` was 0, `g` is incremented by 1.**
