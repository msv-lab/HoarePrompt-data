The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Bob'. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, and `ans`), but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the `print` statement**: The `print` statement is `print('Bob')`.
2. **Determine the content to be printed**: The content to be printed is the string 'Bob'.
3. **Check for variable references**: The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.
4. **Conclusion**: The output will be the string 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
