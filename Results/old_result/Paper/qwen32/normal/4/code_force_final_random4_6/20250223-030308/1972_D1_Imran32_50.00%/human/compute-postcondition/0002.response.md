The code snippet calculates the integer square root of `n` and adds 1 to it, then assigns this value to the variable `root`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `ans` retains its initial value of `n`.

Output State: **Each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6). `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers read from the input. `ans` is assigned the value of `n`. `root` is assigned the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**
