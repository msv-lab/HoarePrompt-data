The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will print the string `'Alice'` as it is, without any reference to the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, or `ans` that are mentioned in the initial state.

Thus, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
