The provided code snippet is designed to process multiple test cases, each involving a single integer `l`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2` and prints this value. The variable `n` is decremented after each test case until it reaches zero.

Given the initial state, `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. However, the provided code only uses a single integer `l` per test case, which suggests that `l` might represent a side length or some other derived value from the square's coordinates.

The code does not modify `t` directly, but it uses `n` to control the number of iterations. Since `n` is initialized with the value of `t` (implied by the context), after all test cases are processed, `n` will be 0.

The output of the code is the printed value of `s` for each test case, but since the code does not return any value explicitly, the final output state will only reflect the changes in `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 0.**
