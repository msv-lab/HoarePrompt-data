The code snippet provided assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Therefore, the value of `ans2` is now equal to the value of `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input with `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x - 1`; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`; `ans2` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.**
