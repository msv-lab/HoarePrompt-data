The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` by reading an integer input. The previous value of `n` is overwritten, but the constraints on `n` (2 <= n <= 100) still apply to the new input value. The values of `t` and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and `r` is an empty list.**
