The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` is the first integer input.
- `x` is the second integer input.
- `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not equal to 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of 1000000007 and `x`.
- `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1.
- `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`.
- `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions.
- `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.

After executing `ax = min(x, ax)`, the value of `ax` will be:
- If `a` is not equal to 2, `ax` was initially 1000000007. So, `ax` becomes `min(x, 1000000007)`.
- If `a` is equal to 2, `ax` was initially `min(1000000007, x)`. So, `ax` remains `min(x, min(1000000007, x))`, which simplifies to `min(x, 1000000007)`.

The other variables (`a`, `x`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `x`, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.**
