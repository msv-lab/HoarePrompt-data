The provided code snippet only resets the variable `sum` to 1, without affecting the values of `n`, `j`, or the previous calculation of `sum`. Therefore, the values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged, and the previous calculation of `sum` is overwritten.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is decremented by 1, `sum` is 1.**

In natural language: The value of `sum` is now 1, while `n` remains the integer input provided, `j` remains `n + 1`, and `t` has been decremented by 1.
