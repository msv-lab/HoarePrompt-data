The provided `print` statement in the Python code snippet is:

```python
print('No')
```

The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement itself is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `a`, `i`, `b`, `c`, or `q`. The string `'No'` is explicitly provided to the `print` function.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
