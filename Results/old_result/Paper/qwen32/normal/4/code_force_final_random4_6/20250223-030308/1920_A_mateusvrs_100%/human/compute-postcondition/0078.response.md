Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than the current value of `_` + 1; `a` and `x` are integers read from the input; `bx` remains unchanged; if `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of the current `x` and the previous `ax`. Otherwise, `ax` remains unchanged and `cx` contains the previous elements plus `x`.**
