The given Python code snippet only contains the line `s = 0`, which sets the variable `s` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50; `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is greater than 0; `i` is 2; `d` is an input integer; `b` is a non-empty string; `j` is the length of `b` if the loop completes all iterations without encountering '*', or the index where the loop breaks due to '*'; `s` is 0.**
