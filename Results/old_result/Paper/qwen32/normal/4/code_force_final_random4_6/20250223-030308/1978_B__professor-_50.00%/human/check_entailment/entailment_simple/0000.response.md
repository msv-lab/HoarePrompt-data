### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum profit Bob can make from selling `n` buns under specific conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic in the provided program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of buns `n`, the usual price `a`, and the initial promotional price `b` are read.

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means that the promotional price is not beneficial (or is the same as the usual price). Hence, selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit: `n * a`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, it means the promotional price is significantly higher than the usual price and can be applied to all buns. The total profit is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2 * b - n + 1` with a common difference of `-1`. This sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \times (\text{first term}) + (\text{number of terms} - 1) \times (\text{common difference}))
     \]
     Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (2 \times (2b - n + 1) + (n - 1) \times (-1)) = \frac{n}{2} \times (4b - 2n + 2 - n + 1) = \frac{n}{2} \times (4b - 3n + 3) = \frac{n}{2} \times (2b - n + 1)
     \]
   - If `b - a < n`, it means the promotional price can only be applied to a subset of the buns, specifically up to `b - a` buns. The profit from selling the first `b - a` buns at the promotional price is the sum of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, up to `b - (b - a) + 1 = a + 1`. The sum of this sequence is:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{(b - a)}{2} \times (b + a)
     \]
     The remaining `n - (b - a)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `a * (n - (b - a))` to the profit. The total profit is:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \frac{(b - a)}{2} \times (b + a) + a \times (n - (b - a))
     \]

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the calculated profit is printed.

### Correctness:
The logic in the program correctly handles all the given conditions and calculates the maximum profit accordingly. The formulae used for the sum of arithmetic sequences are correct and match the problem requirements.
