The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` will split the output of `func_1()` into two parts and assign them to `r` and `c` respectively. Since `r` was previously defined as the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` was defined as the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, executing this line will update `r` to be a string (since `split()` returns a list of strings) and `c` to be the second part of the split output.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, and `_`) remain unchanged by this line of code.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, with `m` being greater than 0; `ans` is a set containing all the values `(q + r) % n` and, if `c` is '1' or '?', also contains the value `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`; `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` as a string; `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `_` is incremented by 1.**
