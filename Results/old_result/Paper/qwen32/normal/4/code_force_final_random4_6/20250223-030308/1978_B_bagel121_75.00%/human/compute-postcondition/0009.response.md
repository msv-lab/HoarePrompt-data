To determine the output of the `print(ans + p2)` statement, we need to break down the problem step-by-step based on the given initial state.

1. **Variables and their relationships**:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0 (though it is not used in the calculation).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `a` is less than `b`.
   - `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

2. **Calculation of `k`**:
   - `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This means `k` is the number of integers between `a` and `b` inclusive, but it is capped at `n`.

3. **Calculation of `ans`**:
   - `ans` is calculated using the formula `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - This formula calculates the sum of the `k` largest integers between `a` and `b` inclusive.
   - `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2` is the average of the `k` largest integers between `a` and `b`.
   - Multiplying this average by `k` gives the sum of these `k` integers.
   - `int(...)` ensures the result is an integer.

4. **Calculation of `p2`**:
   - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - This represents the sum of the remaining integers (if any) that are not included in the `k` largest integers, each being `a`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The `print(ans + p2)` statement will print the sum of `ans` and `p2`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the `k` largest integers between `a` and `b`.
   - `p2` is the sum of the remaining integers (if any), each being `a`.

**Output**:
The `print` statement will output the sum of the `k` largest integers between `a` and `b` inclusive and the sum of the remaining integers (if any), each being `a`.

Output: **ans + p2 (where ans is the sum of the k largest integers between a and b inclusive, and p2 is the sum of the remaining integers (if any), each being a)**
