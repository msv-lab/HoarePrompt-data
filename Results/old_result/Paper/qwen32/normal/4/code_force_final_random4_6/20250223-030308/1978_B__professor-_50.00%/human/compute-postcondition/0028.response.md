Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the given integers. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `n` multiplied by `a`; otherwise, it returns `n` multiplied by `b`.**
