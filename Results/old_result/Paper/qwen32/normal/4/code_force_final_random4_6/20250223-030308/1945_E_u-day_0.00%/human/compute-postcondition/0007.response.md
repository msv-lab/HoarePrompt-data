The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same (greater than 0) for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `i` is incremented by 1, `pos` remains -1 if `arr[i]` is not equal to `k`, or `pos` is set to `i` if `arr[i]` is equal to `k`**.

Since the question specifies only to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we only adjust `i`:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.
