The code snippet `st.add(mid)` adds the current value of `mid` to the set `st`. Given the initial state, `mid` is computed as `(low + high) // 2`. Since `st` initially contains the value `(n - 1) // 2`, after executing the code, `st` will contain both `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`.

Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0 if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `high` is at least `low + 2`; `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**.
