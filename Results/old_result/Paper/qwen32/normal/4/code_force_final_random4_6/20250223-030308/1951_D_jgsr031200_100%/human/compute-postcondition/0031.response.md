Postcondition: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list [1 - k, 1], `h` is the value of `n // (n - k + 1)` from the first iteration, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1. If `h` is less than `k`, then `h` remains less than `k`. Otherwise, `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
