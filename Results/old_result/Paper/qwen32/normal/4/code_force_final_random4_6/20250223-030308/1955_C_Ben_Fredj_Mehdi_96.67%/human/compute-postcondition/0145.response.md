Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `a` is a list of integers.
3. `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
4. `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
5. `z` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('2')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('2')` is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `z`. It simply prints the string `'2'`.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
