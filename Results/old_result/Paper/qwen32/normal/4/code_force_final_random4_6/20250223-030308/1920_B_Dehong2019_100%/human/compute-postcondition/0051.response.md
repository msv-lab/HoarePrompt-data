The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `ans1` is initially calculated as the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first x elements of a)` plus `a[x]` minus `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, or simply `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus `2 * (sum of the first x elements of a)` plus `a[x]` if `i + x` is not less than `n`. After adding `a[i]` to `ans1`, the new value of `ans1` will be its previous value plus `a[i]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x + 1`; `ans1` is its previous value plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**
