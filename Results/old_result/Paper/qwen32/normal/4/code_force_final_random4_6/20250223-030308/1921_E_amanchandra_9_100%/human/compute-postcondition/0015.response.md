Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is `max(1, d - x)`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**.
