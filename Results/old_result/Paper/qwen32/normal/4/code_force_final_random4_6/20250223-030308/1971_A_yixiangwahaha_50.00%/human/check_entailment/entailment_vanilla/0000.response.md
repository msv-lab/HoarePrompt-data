Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, but it assumes there are always exactly 10 test cases. This is incorrect as the problem statement specifies that the number of test cases, `t`, can be between 1 and 100.
2. The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not use it. Instead, it hardcoded the loop to run 10 times, which is not flexible and does not adhere to the problem description.
3. The program correctly reads each pair of integers `x` and `y` for each test case and stores them in separate lists `x` and `y`.
4. It then correctly iterates over these lists and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair in the required format.
5. However, due to the hardcoded loop, the program will fail if the number of test cases is not 10, which is a violation of the problem statement.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the variable number of test cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
