The code updates the `container` variable by adding the difference between `water` and `target`. Given the initial state, the updated value of `container` will be `container + (water - target)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is updated to `container + (water - target)`, `water` is the next element in the list `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues without returning 'No'.**
