To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions. The loop continues to increment `cur` until the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied or `cur` exceeds `high`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is initialized to `low`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.
   - In each iteration, it checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
     - If true, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If false, it increments `cur` by 1.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates either when the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied, or when `cur` exceeds `high`.
   - If the loop exits because `cur` exceeds `high`, it prints `p3`.

Given the conditions for the first 3 iterations:

- After 1 iteration, `cur` remains `low` or is incremented to `low + 1`.
- After 2 iterations, `cur` remains `low` or is incremented to `low + 1` or `low + 2`.
- After 3 iterations, `cur` remains `low` or is incremented up to `low + 3`.

Thus, the loop will continue until `cur` either satisfies the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` or exceeds `high`.

**Final Output State**:
- If the loop breaks due to `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the output will be `p1 - cur + p3`.
- If the loop exits because `cur` exceeds `high`, the output will be `p3`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can only conclude the output based on the loop's termination conditions.

Output State: **The output will be either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met during the loop, or `p3` if `cur` exceeds `high`.**

In simpler terms, the final output will be `p1 - cur + p3` if the loop finds a `cur` that satisfies the condition, otherwise, it will be `p3`.
