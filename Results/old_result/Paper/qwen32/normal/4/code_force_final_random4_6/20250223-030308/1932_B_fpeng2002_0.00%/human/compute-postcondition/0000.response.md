The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases to be processed. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6. 

The variable `num_tests` is now assigned the value of the input integer, and no other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is the input integer representing the number of test cases.**
