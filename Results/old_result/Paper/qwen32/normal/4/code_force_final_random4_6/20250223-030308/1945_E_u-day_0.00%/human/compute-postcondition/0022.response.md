Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `high` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 2; `st` is a set containing the value `(n - 1) // 2`; `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `low` has been updated to `(n - 1) // 2`, which is the same as the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
