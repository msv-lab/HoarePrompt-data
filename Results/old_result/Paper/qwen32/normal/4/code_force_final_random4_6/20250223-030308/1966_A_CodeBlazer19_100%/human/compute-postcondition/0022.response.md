To determine the output of the `print(n)` statement, let's break down the given initial state:

1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
2. `n` and `k` are new integers read from the input.
3. `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.
4. `p` is a list where each element is the count of a unique integer from the previous `l`, specifically `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`.
5. `i` is `i + 1`.

The `print(n)` statement specifically outputs the value of the variable `n`. Based on the initial state, `n` is an integer that has been read from the input.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot provide a numerical value for `n`. However, we know that `n` is an integer that was read from the input.

Therefore, the output of the `print(n)` statement will be the value of `n` as it was read from the input.

Output: **n (where n is the integer value read from the input)**
