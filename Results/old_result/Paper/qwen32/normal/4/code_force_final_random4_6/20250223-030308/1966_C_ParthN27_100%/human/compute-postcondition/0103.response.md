The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation on the variable `ans` with 1. Given that `ans` is initially 1, this operation will toggle `ans` between 0 and 1. Since `ans` is 1, after the operation, `ans` will become 0.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` which contains unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the integer input from the user, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less.**
