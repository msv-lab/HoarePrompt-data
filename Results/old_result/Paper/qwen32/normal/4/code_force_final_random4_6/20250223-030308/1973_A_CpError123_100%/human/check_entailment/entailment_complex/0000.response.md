### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games among three players based on their final scores. The scores are provided in non-decreasing order, and the program processes multiple test cases.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points distributed in the games must be even (since each game results in a total of 2 points being distributed between the two players, either as 2-0 or 1-1).

2. **Calculating Maximum Draws**:
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played because each game contributes 2 points.
   - The program also calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of games that could have involved the player with the lowest score `a` and the middle score `b` combined, which is a limiting factor for the total number of draws.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the maximum number of draws is constrained by both the total number of games and the number of games that could have involved the two players with the lowest scores.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where no games were played (`0 0 0`), resulting in `0` draws.
   - It correctly identifies impossible score distributions, such as `1 1 1`, by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic is consistent with the problem requirements. It correctly identifies invalid score distributions and calculates the maximum possible number of draws for valid distributions.

**Correctness: True**
