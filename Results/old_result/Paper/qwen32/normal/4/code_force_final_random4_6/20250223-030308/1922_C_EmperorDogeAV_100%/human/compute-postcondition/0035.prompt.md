Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cities` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the number of cities, followed by `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities. The next integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by `m` pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999999999999999
    forward = 999999999999999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cities` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers representing the number of cities and their coordinates. The first integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) represents the number of cities, followed by `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities. The next integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) represents the number of queries, followed by `m` pairs of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except at index `i` where it is 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is set to `abs(forward - cities[i])`. `n` is at least 2. If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`; otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`; otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` was greater than 0 before the increment, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999. If `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to `abs(forward - cities[i])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` remains the same, `back` is set to `cities[2]`. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[4]`. Otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999`. `prog_cities[3]` is set to 1 if `abs(forward - cities[3]) < abs(cities[3] - back)`. Otherwise, `prog_cities[3]` is set to `abs(cities[4] - cities[3])` if `n > 4`, otherwise `prog_cities[3]` is `abs(999999999999999999 - cities[3])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
