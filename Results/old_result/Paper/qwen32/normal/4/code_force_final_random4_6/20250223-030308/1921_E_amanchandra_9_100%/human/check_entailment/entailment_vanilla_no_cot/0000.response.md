Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible scenarios. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Initial Check for Draw**: The program starts by checking if Alice's row is greater than Bob's row (`a > c`). If true, it outputs "Draw". However, this is incorrect because the game can still be won by Alice or Bob even if Alice starts in a row greater than Bob's, depending on the column positions and the number of moves available.

2. **Calculation of Reachable Columns**: The program calculates the number of moves Alice can make (`x = abs(a - c) // 2`). This is based on the assumption that Alice can move diagonally and vertically, but it does not account for all possible moves correctly, especially when the number of moves is odd or even.

3. **Range of Reachable Columns**: The program calculates the range of columns Alice can reach (`l` and `r`). However, the logic for determining the range is incorrect and does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob can move diagonally and vertically. The range should be calculated based on the maximum number of moves Alice can make and the constraints of the board.

4. **Checking for Victory**: The program checks if Bob's column is within the range of columns Alice can reach. If true, it outputs "Alice". However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for Bob's possible moves and the fact that Bob can also move diagonally and vertically.

5. **Bob's Turn**: The program does not correctly account for Bob's turn and his possible moves. Bob can also move diagonally and vertically, and the program does not correctly determine if Bob can reach Alice's position before Alice can reach Bob's position.

To correctly determine the outcome of the game, a more detailed analysis of the possible moves for both Alice and Bob is required. The program needs to correctly simulate the game based on the rules and determine if Alice can force a win, Bob can force a win, or if the game will end in a draw.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x_a == x_b and y_a == y_b:
            print('Draw')
        elif x_a > h or x_b < 1:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            if x_a + (w - 1) < x_b or x_b + (w - 1) < x_a:
                print('Draw')
            else:
                if (x_a + x_b) % 2 == 1:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Bob')

# This is a simplified version and may need further refinement based on the full problem constraints.
```

This corrected version considers the parity of the sum of the rows of Alice and Bob, which is a key insight in solving the problem. However, it still needs to be thoroughly tested against all possible scenarios.
