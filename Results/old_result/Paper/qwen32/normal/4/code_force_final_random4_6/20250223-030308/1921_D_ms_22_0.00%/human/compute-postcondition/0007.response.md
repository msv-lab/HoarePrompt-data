The code snippet provided sorts the list `b`. Therefore, the list `b` will be in non-decreasing order after the execution of the code. The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
