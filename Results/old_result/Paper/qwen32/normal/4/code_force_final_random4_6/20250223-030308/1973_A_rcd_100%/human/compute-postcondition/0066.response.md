The provided Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`), but the `print` statement does not depend on these variables. It simply prints `-1`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 499\). This means `t` can range from 1 to 500.
2. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers that are read from the input, and their sum is odd.
3. The `print` statement is `print(-1)`, which directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`, their specific values do not affect the output.

Output: **-1**
