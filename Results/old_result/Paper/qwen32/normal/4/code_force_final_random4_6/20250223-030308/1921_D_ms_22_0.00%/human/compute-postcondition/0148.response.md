The only variable in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `max_heap` is not empty. If `max_heap` has one less element, it means that one element has been popped from it in the previous iteration. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to add an element back to `max_heap`.

State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` has one less element and must have at least one more element added to it, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `ans` is updated by adding `diff1` to it and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `diff2` to it and `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff` and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff` and `tp2` is decremented by 1.**

Since the state of `max_heap` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not empty, we can add an arbitrary valid tuple to it. For simplicity, let's assume we add a tuple `(-diff, a[0], 0)` to `max_heap`.

State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` has one less element and now contains at least one more element such as `(-diff, a[0], 0)`, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `ans` is updated by adding `diff1` to it and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `diff2` to it and `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff` and `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff` and `tp2` is decremented by 1.**
