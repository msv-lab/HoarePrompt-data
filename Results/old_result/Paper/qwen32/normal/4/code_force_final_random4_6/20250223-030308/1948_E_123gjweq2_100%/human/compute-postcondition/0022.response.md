The given code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. This means that the value at the index `left + mid + i` in the `cliquess` array will be updated to the value of `clique`.

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0.
- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`.
- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`.
- `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` except `arr[left + mid + i]` which is `big_element - i`.
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

After executing the code snippet `cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique`, the value at `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is explicitly set to `clique`. This does not change the value since it was already `clique`. Therefore, no change occurs in the state of the variables.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` are `left + 1` to `left + mid`, `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` are all `clique`, `arr[left + mid]` to `arr[left + mid + (not_mid - 1)]` are `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` except `arr[left + mid + i]` which is `big_element - i`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
