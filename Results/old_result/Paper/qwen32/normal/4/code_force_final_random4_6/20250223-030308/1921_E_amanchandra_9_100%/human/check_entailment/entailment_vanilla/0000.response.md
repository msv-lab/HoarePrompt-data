To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze its logic and compare it against the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Alice starts at (x_a, y_a), Bob starts at (x_b, y_b).
   - Alice can move down, down-left, or down-right.
   - Bob can move up, up-left, or up-right.
   - If a player moves to the same cell as the other player, they win.
   - If a player cannot make a move (Alice at the last row, Bob at the first row), the game is a draw.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will make moves that maximize their chances of winning or minimize their chances of losing.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - Alice wins if she can move to Bob's position before Bob can move to Alice's position.
   - Bob wins if he can move to Alice's position before Alice can move to Bob's position.
   - If neither can reach the other's position without being blocked, the game is a draw.

### Program Analysis:
The program takes multiple test cases and determines the winner for each based on the initial positions of Alice and Bob. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the board dimensions (h, w) and the initial positions of Alice and Bob.

2. **Decision Logic:**
   - If Alice's row (a) is greater than Bob's row (c), the program prints "Draw". This is because Alice is already below Bob and cannot move up, so Bob can always avoid Alice.
   - If Alice's row is not greater than Bob's row:
     - It calculates the number of moves Alice can make vertically towards Bob's position (x = abs(a - c) // 2).
     - It then calculates the horizontal range Alice can cover in those moves (l = max(1, d - x), r = min(w, d + x)).
     - If the number of vertical moves is odd, it checks if Bob's column is within the horizontal range Alice can cover in the next move (x + 1) and prints "Alice" if true, otherwise "Draw".
     - If the number of vertical moves is even, it checks if Bob's column is within the horizontal range Alice can cover in the current move (x) and prints "Bob" if true, otherwise "Draw".

### Correctness of the Program:
The program's logic seems to correctly determine the winner based on the initial positions and the constraints of the game. Here's why:

- **Alice's Vertical Position:**
  - If Alice is already below Bob (a > c), she cannot win, so the game is a draw.
  
- **Horizontal Range Calculation:**
  - The program calculates the horizontal range Alice can cover based on the number of vertical moves she can make.
  - It correctly checks if Bob can be within this range in the next move (if moves are odd) or in the current move (if moves are even).

- **Winning Conditions:**
  - If Bob's column is within the range Alice can cover, Alice wins if moves are odd, and Bob wins if moves are even.
  - If Bob's column is not within the range, the game is a draw.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic aligns with the problem description and correctly determines the outcome of the game for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
