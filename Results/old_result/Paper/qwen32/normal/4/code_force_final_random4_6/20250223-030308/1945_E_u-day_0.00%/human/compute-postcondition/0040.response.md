The given Python code snippet is:

```python
print(1)
```

The initial state describes several variables (`pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`, and elements of `arr`) and their relationships, but the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the initial state provided, the output will be the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
