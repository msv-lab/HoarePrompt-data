You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for maximizing the product of two numbers `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the product of two numbers `x` and `y` by potentially swapping corresponding digits. The operations can be performed any number of times, and the digits can only be from 1 to 9.

### Program Analysis
The provided program takes the following approach:
1. For each corresponding pair of digits `(a[i], b[i])` from `x` and `y`:
   - If the digits are the same, they are added to the resulting numbers `kq1` and `kq2` without any changes.
   - If the digits are different, the program swaps the digits in such a way that the larger digit goes to `kq1` and the smaller digit goes to `kq2` if it's the first differing pair. For subsequent differing pairs, the smaller digit goes to `kq1` and the larger digit goes to `kq2`.

### Potential Issues
The logic used in the program does not guarantee that the product is maximized. The swapping strategy is not optimal. Specifically, the program uses a greedy approach that doesn't consider the overall product but rather a simple rule for the first differing pair.

### Counterexample
Consider the following test case:
```
1
91
19
```
According to the program's logic:
- For the first pair `(9, 1)`, it will swap them because they are different and it's the first differing pair, resulting in `kq1 = 1` and `kq2 = 9`.
- For the second pair `(1, 9)`, it will not swap them because it's not the first differing pair, resulting in `kq1 = 11` and `kq2 = 99`.

The resulting numbers are `11` and `99`, and their product is `1089`.

However, the optimal solution would be to not swap any digits, resulting in `x = 91` and `y = 19`, and their product is `1729`, which is greater than `1089`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not always produce the maximum product for all possible inputs, and therefore does not meet the problem description.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation
The program uses a suboptimal strategy for swapping digits, which does not guarantee the maximum product for all inputs. A more sophisticated approach, such as considering all possible swaps and calculating the product, would be required to ensure the maximum product is always achieved.
