You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups required. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not accurately implement the requirements of the problem.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Bitwise Operation**: The line `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is attempting to flip all 31 bits of the number `num`. However, `(1 << 31) - 1` is `2^31 - 1`, which is a 32-bit number with all bits set to 1 (i.e., `0xFFFFFFFF`). This operation will flip all 32 bits of `num`, which is not what is required. The problem specifies flipping only the least significant 31 bits.

2. **Incorrect Group Counting Logic**: The code attempts to use a dictionary `count` to keep track of numbers and their bitwise complements, but it doesn't correctly handle the logic for grouping numbers based on the condition that no two numbers in the same group can have matching bits from 1st to 31st bit.

3. **Incorrect Group Assignment**: The code increments the result `res` every time it encounters a new number that hasn't been encountered before (after applying the bitwise operation). This does not correctly reflect the number of groups needed.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that no two numbers in a group share the same bit in the range from 1st to 31st bit. This can be achieved by using a set to track the bitwise representation of the numbers and ensuring that each new number does not conflict with any existing number in the same group.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    used = set()
    for num in a:
        num &= (1 << 31) - 1  # Keep only the least significant 31 bits
        while num in used:
            num += 1  # Find the next available number that doesn't conflict
        used.add(num)
    return len(used)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

This corrected version ensures that each number is assigned to a unique group based on the least significant 31 bits, and it correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem.
