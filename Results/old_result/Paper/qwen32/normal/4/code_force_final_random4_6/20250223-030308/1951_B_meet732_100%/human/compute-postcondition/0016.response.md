Postcondition: **`a` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains `t`, `n` (must be greater than 0), `k`, and a list of `n` integers; `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`; `i` is 1; `ind` remains an empty list if the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` is [1]; if `c` was 2, `c` remains 2 if the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` becomes 3. Otherwise, `c` remains 0 if the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is not greater than `x`, otherwise `c` becomes 1. If `c` was 2 and the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `a` is greater than `x`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
