Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(N)`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, and `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`. Additionally, `n * m` is not equal to `k`.**
