Output State: **`queue` has the same number of elements as initially, with an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `visited` contains all reachable nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited` before. `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor. `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged. `tree[current]` is a list with at least two elements. `neighbor` is the second element in `tree[current]`. `visited` now includes `neighbor`.**

In natural language: The output state is that `visited` now includes `neighbor`, while all other variables retain their initial states. If `neighbor` was not already in `visited`, it has been added to `visited`. The `queue` may have an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended to it if `neighbor` was not in `visited` before. All other variables like `queue`, `current`, `dist`, `start`, `target`, and `tree[current]` remain unchanged.
