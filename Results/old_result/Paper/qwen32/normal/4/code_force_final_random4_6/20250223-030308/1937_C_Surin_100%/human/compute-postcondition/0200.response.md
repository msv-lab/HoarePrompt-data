The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `1, n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range `1, n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is unchanged.
- `n` is greater than `i+1`.
- `kp` is incremented by 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received).
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `r` is the new input string.
- `i` is unchanged.
- The output buffer is flushed.
- If `r` equals `'>'`, then `prev` is set to `i`.
- If `r` does not equal `'>'` and `r2` equals `'<'` and `r` equals `'='`, then `prev` is set to `i`.
- Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.
- `r2` is the new input string if `r` does not equal `'>'` and `r2` equals `'<'` and `r` equals `'='`; otherwise, `r2` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i+2`, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the last value of `i` for which the input was `'<'` (or `0` if no `'<'` was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1, the output buffer is flushed, `prev` is set according to the conditions, `r2` is set according to the conditions**
