The code snippet appends a new value to the list `pos`. The value appended is calculated as `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, where `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `elements`, and `elements[-negatives:]` represents the last `negatives` elements of the list `elements`.

Given the initial state, `s` is the sum of `elements`, and `elements[-negatives:]` is the sublist of the last `negatives` elements. The expression `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` calculates the sum of all elements in `elements` and subtracts twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements.

Thus, the list `pos` will now contain this newly calculated value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of integers such that 0 <= `removals` <= len(`elements`) and 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`); `pos` is a list containing one element, which is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`; `s` is the sum of `elements`.**
