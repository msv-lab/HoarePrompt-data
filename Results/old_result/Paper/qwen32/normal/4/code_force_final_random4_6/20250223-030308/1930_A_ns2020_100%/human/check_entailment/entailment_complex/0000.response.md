### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the score by choosing pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. To achieve the maximum score, we should aim to pair the smallest possible numbers together because the score is incremented by the minimum of each pair.

The given program sorts the list of integers in ascending order. After sorting, the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list. By summing every second element starting from the first element (i.e., elements at even indices), we are effectively summing the smaller number of each pair.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Read the integer `n`.
   - Read the list of `2n` integers.
   - Sort the list of integers.
   - Sum the integers at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which correspond to the smaller numbers in each pair.
   - Print the sum as the maximum score for that test case.

This approach ensures that we are always adding the smaller number of each pair to the score, thereby maximizing the score.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by summing the smaller number of each pair. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
