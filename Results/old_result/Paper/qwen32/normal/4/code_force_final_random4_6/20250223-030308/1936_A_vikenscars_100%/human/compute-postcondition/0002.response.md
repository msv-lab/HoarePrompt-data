To determine the output state, we need to consider the given code snippet and the initial state. The code snippet is:

```python
ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
```

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4
- `max_item_idx` is 0

The variable `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value directly. However, since `i` is used in the function call, we need to assume it has some value, but its specific value is not provided.

The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact value that `ans` will hold. However, we can state that `ans` will be assigned the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`.

Since `max_item_idx` is 0, the function call becomes `func_1(0, 0, i, i)`.

The output state will include:
- `n` remains an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4
- `max_item_idx` remains 0
- `ans` is assigned the result of `func_1(0, 0, i, i)`

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4; `max_item_idx` is 0; `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, i, i)`**
