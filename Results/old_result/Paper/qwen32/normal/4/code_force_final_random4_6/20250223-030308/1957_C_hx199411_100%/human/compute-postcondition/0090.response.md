The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remains unchanged except for the new variables `c` and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain the same. Two new variables, `c` and `r`, are introduced and assigned integer values from the input.
