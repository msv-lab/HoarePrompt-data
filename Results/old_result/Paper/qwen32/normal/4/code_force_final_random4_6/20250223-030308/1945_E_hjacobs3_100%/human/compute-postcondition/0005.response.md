Output State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is `(l + r) // 2`, `r` is `n`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`. The value of `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`.**

In natural language: The variable `l` is updated to the value of `mid`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
