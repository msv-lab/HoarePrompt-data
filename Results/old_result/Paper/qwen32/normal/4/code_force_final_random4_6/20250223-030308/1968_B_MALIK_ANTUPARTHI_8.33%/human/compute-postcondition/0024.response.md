Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; the sum of all `n` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `m` values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user input; `j` is incremented by 1 or 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` and `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to `j + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to the previous value of `j` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
