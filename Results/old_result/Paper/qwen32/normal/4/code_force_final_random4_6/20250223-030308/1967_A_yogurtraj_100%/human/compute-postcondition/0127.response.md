To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `ii` is 2. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `n` is an integer greater than 0. This variable represents the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
- `k` is 0. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `r` is `a[n - 1]`, which means `r` is the last (and largest) element of the sorted list `a`.
- `rem` is 0. This variable is not modified before the print statement, so it remains 0.
- `y` is 0. This variable is not modified before the print statement, so it remains 0.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

Let's break down the expression:
- `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.

So, the expression simplifies to:
\[ (r - 1) \times n + 1 + 0 + 0 \]
\[ = (r - 1) \times n + 1 \]

### Final Output:
The print statement will output:
\[ (r - 1) \times n + 1 \]
Where `r` is the largest element in the sorted list `a` and `n` is the length of the list `a`.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the largest element in the sorted list a and n is the length of the list a)**
