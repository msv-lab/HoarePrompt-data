The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` representing the size of an `n x n` matrix. For each test case, it calculates a specific result `res` based on the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` summed over all `i` from `0` to `n-1`. It then prints this result along with `2 * n`. Following this, it outputs a series of commands involving the matrix rows, printing each row twice with different labels ('1' and '2'). The final output for each test case includes the calculated result and the series of commands for the last test case.
