The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides conditions and values for certain variables, but these do not affect the content of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `x`, `s`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `x` is defined as the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `s[0]`, and it is not equal to -1.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
- `x` can either be 1 or `n // 2`.

However, none of these conditions or variable values influence the `print` statement, which simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
