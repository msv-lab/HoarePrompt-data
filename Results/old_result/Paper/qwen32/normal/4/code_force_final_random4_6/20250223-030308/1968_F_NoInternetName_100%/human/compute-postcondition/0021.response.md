To determine the output state, let's break down the code and understand the impact on the variables.

The given line of code is:
```
lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
```

This line does the following:
1. `inds[x[r]]` retrieves the list of indices from `inds` where the value in `x` at index `r` appears.
2. `func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` is called with the list of indices and a lambda function that checks if an index is less than `l`. The result of `func_4` is expected to be an index or `None`.
3. `or 0` ensures that if `func_4` returns `None`, the value used is `0` instead.
4. The final result is the element in the list `inds[x[r]]` at the index determined by the previous steps, which is assigned to `lower`.

Since the exact behavior of `func_4` is not specified, we'll assume it returns an appropriate index or `None`, and we'll use the `or 0` logic to determine the final index used.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `n` and `q` are integers.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`.
- `x` is a list of cumulative XOR values.
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists mapping each unique value in `x` to its indices.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, the cumulative XOR from index `l` to `r-1` in `a` is `0`.

The code does not modify `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `x`, or `inds` directly; it only computes and assigns a value to `lower`.

Thus, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears, and `q` is greater than 0; `lower` is an integer determined by the indices in `inds[x[r]]` and the condition `arg < l`.**
