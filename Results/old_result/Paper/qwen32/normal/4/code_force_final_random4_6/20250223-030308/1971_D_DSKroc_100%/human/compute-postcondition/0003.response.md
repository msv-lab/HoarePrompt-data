Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where `s` has been updated to the new input value, `count` is 0.**

In this output state, the variables `t` and `s` retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state, and a new variable `count` is introduced with a value of 0.
