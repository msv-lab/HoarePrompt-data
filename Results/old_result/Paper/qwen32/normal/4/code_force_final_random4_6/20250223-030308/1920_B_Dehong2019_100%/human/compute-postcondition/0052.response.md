The code snippet subtracts `a[i + x] * 2` from `ans1`. Given the initial state, `ans1` was previously `ans1 + a[i]`. After the operation, `ans1` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`.

Output State: **`t` remains the input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are the integers read from the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `i` is `x + 1`; `ans1` is its previous value plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**
