The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those for the loop to execute. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start. The value of `dp` is also not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is 0, and `m` is `n - num`. `k` must be greater than 0**
