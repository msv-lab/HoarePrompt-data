The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The other variables (`max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, and `m`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted indices, `ans` is the sum of the minimum differences, `t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
