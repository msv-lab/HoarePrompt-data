Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `i` is -1; `j` is m; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
