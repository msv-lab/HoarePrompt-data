Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])` and `abs(a[1] - b[1])`, `temp` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
