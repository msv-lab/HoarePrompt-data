The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. None of the other variables (`t`, `a`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, `ans`) are affected by this code snippet. The value of `n` is now an integer read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is an index such that `l < n - 1` and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`, `r` is `l`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list until the first element that is not equal to its subsequent element. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`**
