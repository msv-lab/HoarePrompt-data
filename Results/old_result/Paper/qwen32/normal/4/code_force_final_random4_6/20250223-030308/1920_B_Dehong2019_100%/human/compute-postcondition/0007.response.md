The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the first element in the sorted list `a` (since `i` is 0).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input where `x` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a`.
- `i` is 0.

After executing the line `ans1 -= a[i] * 2`, the value of `ans1` is reduced by twice the value of the first element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers read from the input where `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the first element of `a`; `i` is 0.**
