The code snippet provided assigns the integer value of `nums[0]` to `num1`. Given the initial state, `nums` is a list of strings, and `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) representing edges of the tree where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the last line contains a single integer u_1 representing the starting node of the stone, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `numbers` is a list containing one element `[num1, num2]`; `nums` is a list of strings obtained from the input; `num1` is the integer value of `nums[0]`; `num2` is the integer value of `nums[1]`. If `len(nums)` is not equal to 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes occur.**
