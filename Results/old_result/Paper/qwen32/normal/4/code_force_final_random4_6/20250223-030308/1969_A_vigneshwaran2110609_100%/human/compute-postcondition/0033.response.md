The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `x`, `l`, or `flag`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is the total number of iterations, `x` must be greater than `n`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `flag` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
