Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

**Initial State:**
- `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed.
- `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `res` is the count of all `0`s in `a`.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.

**Print Statement:**
```python
print(res)
```

**Analysis:**
- The variable `res` is defined as the count of all `0`s in the list `a`.
- Since `a` has all trailing zeros removed, it means that `a` does not end with any `0`s.
- However, `res` counts all `0`s in the list `a`, not just the trailing ones. Therefore, `res` will include any `0`s that appear in the list `a` before the trailing zeros are removed.

**Conclusion:**
The value of `res` is the count of all `0`s in the original list before the trailing zeros were removed. Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we know that `res` is the count of all `0`s in `a`.

Thus, the print statement will output the value of `res`, which is the count of all `0`s in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of all 0s in the list `a`)**
