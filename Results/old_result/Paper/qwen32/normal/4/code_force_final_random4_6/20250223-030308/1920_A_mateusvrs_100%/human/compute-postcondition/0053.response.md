The code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `ax`. The value is `1000000007`, which is the result of converting `1000000000.0 + 7` to an integer. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is the input integer, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum `x` value encountered when `a` was 1, `cx` is an empty set, and `r` is a list containing the value 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive)**.
