The value of `y` is decremented by 1. Since `y` was initially equal to `p3`, after the operation, `y` becomes `p3 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` must be non-negative; `x` is 1; `y` is equal to `p3 - 1`; `p1 - x > p2 - y`**
