The code snippet `sp += a[s]` modifies the value of `sp` by adding the value of `a[s]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is 0
- `b` is `p[b] - 1`
- `s` is `p[s] - 1`
- `p` is a list of integers from the input
- `a` is a new list of integers from the input
- `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`
- `sm` is `max(0, a[s])`
- `sp` is `a[s]`
- `bp` is `a[b]`

After executing the code `sp += a[s]`, the value of `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s]` or `2 * a[s]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`, `sm` is `max(0, a[s])`, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`**.
