The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `L`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the new variable `L` is introduced with the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers read from the input.**
