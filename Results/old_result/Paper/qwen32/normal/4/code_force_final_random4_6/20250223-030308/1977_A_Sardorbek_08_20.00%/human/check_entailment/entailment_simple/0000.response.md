Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that would result in incorrect outputs for certain inputs. Specifically, the logic used to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed.

1. The condition `if b == c:` is correct. If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, then it's possible to simply add one cube per move, and the answer should be "Yes".
2. The condition `elif b < c:` is also correct. If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it's impossible to end up with `m` cubes, so the answer should be "No".
3. The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. The variable `a` here refers to the total number of test cases, not the number of moves for the current test case. It should be `b % 2 == c % 2` instead. The correct logic here should be: if the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves `b` is the same as the parity of the desired number of cubes `c`, then it's possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because the only way to change the parity of the number of cubes is by performing a move (either adding or removing a cube), and thus after an even number of moves, the parity of the number of cubes will be the same as it was initially (which is 0, or even).

The corrected condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`. The original program mistakenly uses `a % 2 == b % 2`, which leads to incorrect results for some test cases.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the third condition.

Correctness: **False**
