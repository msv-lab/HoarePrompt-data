The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Initially, `a` has all leading zeros removed from `n` and a `0` appended to the end. After executing `a.pop()`, the last element (which is `0`) is removed from `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input with all leading zeros removed; `res` is 0.**
