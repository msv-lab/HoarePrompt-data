Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is -1 if the initial value of `k` was 0, otherwise `k` is `k - 1`; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `sm` remain as described in the initial state; if `k` is 0 (which is not possible after this operation if it was 0 initially), `bm` is `max(bm, bp)`; if `k` is not 0, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. If `k` was initially 0, it will now be -1, making the condition `k == 0` false. The values of `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` are calculated based on the initial value of `k` and the other variables as described.
