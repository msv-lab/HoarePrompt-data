Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` has one less element, `visited` contains all reachable nodes, `current` is the node that was just removed from the queue, `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`, `start` and `target` remain unchanged. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance from `start` to `current`. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues execution.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `queue` has the same number of elements as initially, with an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `visited` contains all reachable nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`; `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor; `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`; `start` and `target` remain unchanged; `tree[current]` is a list with at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `queue` has the same number of elements as initially, with an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `visited` contains all reachable nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited` before. `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor. `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged. `tree[current]` is a list with at least one element. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `queue` has the same number of elements as initially, with an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` appended if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `visited` contains all reachable nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited` before. `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor. `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged. `tree[current]` is a list with at least two elements. `neighbor` is the second element in `tree[current]`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited` initially, `visited` now includes `neighbor`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
