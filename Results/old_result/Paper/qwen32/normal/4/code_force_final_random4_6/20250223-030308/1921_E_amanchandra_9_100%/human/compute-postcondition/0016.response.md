Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than `c`, no changes are made to `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`. If `a` is less than or equal to `c`, `x` is set to `abs(a - c) // 2`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is odd, then `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, then `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`**
