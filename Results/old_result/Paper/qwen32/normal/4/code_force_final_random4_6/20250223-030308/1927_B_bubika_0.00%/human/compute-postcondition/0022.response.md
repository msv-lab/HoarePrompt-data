The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces, and then converts each substring into an integer, resulting in a list of integers. This changes the value of `s` from its previous state to the newly created list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `r` is a string formed by concatenating characters from `a` based on the indices found in `b` for each element in `s`; `b` is a list with values incremented based on the occurrences of each element in `s`.**
