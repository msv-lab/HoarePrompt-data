To determine the new value of `bm` after the given operation, we need to evaluate the expression `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.

Given:
- `bm` is `max(0, a[b])`
- `a[b]` is an element in the list `a` at index `b`
- `k` is `-2`
- `bp` is `3 * a[b]`

We will calculate `a[b] * k + bp`:
- `a[b] * k + bp` = `a[b] * (-2) + 3 * a[b]` = `-2 * a[b] + 3 * a[b]` = `a[b]`

Thus, `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` = `max(bm, a[b])`

Since `bm` is already `max(0, a[b])`, we need to consider two cases:
1. If `a[b]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `bm` is `a[b]` and `max(bm, a[b])` is `a[b]`. Adding `a[b]` to `bm` results in `bm` being `2 * a[b]`.
2. If `a[b]` is less than 0, then `bm` is `0` and `max(bm, a[b])` is `0`. Adding `0` to `bm` results in `bm` remaining `0`.

Therefore, `bm` will be `2 * a[b]` if `a[b]` is non-negative, otherwise `bm` will remain `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `2 * a[b]` if `a[b]` is non-negative, otherwise `bm` is `0`, `sm` is `2 * a[s]`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`.**
