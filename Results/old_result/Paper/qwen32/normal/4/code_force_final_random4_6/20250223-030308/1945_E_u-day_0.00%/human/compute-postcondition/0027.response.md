The value of `high` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0 if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `high` is equal to `mid`; `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0 if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, otherwise `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`; `high` is equal to `mid`; `st` is a set containing the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid`; `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
