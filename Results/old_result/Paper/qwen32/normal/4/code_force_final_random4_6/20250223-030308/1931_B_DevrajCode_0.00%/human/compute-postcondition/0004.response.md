Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, and `total_water % n` is equal to 0; `target` is equal to `total_water // n`.**

Natural Language: The value of `target` is now set to the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
