The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is a list containing two tuples `((x, y), (x, y))`; `res` is 0; `x` is the first integer input; `y` is the second integer input; `i` is 2**
