Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2; `_` is 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers read from the new input; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`. If `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0`, then `x` and `y` are updated using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their values based on the old values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**

In this output state, `x` has been updated to `(a + b + c) // 2` using the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `y` remain unchanged from the initial state unless `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0`, in which case `y` would also be updated to `a + b` using the new values of `a` and `b`.
