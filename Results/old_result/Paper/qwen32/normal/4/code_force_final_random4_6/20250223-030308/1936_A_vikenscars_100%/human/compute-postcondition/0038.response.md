The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `pair_idx`. This means that `pair_idx` will now hold the value of `i`, and no other variables are affected by this assignment.

Given the initial state, `pair_idx` was previously set based on certain conditions involving `func_1` and `ans1` and `ans2`. However, after executing the line `pair_idx = i`, `pair_idx` is simply `i`.

Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns `'<'`. If `ans1` is `'<'`, `pair_idx` is set to `i`. If `ans1` is `'='` and `ans2` is `'>'`, then `pair_idx` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`. `n` is greater than 0, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`. If `ans1` was `'='`, `ans2` retains its original value unless `ans1` is `'='` and `ans2` is `'>'`, in which case `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. `i` is incremented by 1. `pair_idx` is now `i`.**
