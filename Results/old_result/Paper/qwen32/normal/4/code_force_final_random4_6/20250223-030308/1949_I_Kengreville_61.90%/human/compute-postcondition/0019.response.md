Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is the difference between `x[i]` and `x[j]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that the variable `dx` has been assigned the value of `x[i] - x[j]`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
