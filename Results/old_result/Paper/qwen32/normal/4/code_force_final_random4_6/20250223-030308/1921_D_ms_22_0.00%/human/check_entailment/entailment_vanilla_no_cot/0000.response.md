Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not guarantee to find the maximum difference \( D \). The logic used in the code does not ensure that the maximum possible difference is achieved for each element in array \( a \). 

Here's a brief explanation of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Greedy Approach**: The code uses a greedy approach by initially pushing the maximum possible difference (either with the smallest or largest element in \( b \)) for each element in \( a \) into a max-heap. However, this does not ensure that the overall maximum difference is achieved, as it does not consider the optimal pairing of elements in \( a \) and \( b \) globally.

2. **Heap Usage**: The heap is used to pop the largest difference first, but the subsequent logic for adjusting the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` does not guarantee that the maximum possible difference is always achieved. The code does not explore all possible pairings of elements in \( a \) and \( b \) to maximize the total difference.

3. **Optimal Pairing**: To maximize the total difference \( D \), it is necessary to consider pairing each element in \( a \) with either the smallest or largest possible element in \( b \) in a way that maximizes the sum of absolute differences. This requires a more optimal strategy than the one used in the code.

A correct approach would involve sorting both arrays and then using a two-pointer technique to maximize the total difference by pairing the largest elements of one array with the smallest elements of the other array and vice versa.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        b.sort()
        ans = 0
        i, j = 0, m - 1
        for x in a:
            ans += max(abs(x - b[i]), abs(x - b[j]))
            if abs(x - b[i]) > abs(x - b[j]):
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func()
```

This corrected version sorts both arrays and then uses a two-pointer technique to maximize the total difference \( D \) by always choosing the best possible element from \( b \) for each element in \( a \).
