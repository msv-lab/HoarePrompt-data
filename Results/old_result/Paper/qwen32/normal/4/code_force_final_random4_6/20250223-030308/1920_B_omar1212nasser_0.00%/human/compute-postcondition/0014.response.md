The value of `s` is decreased by the value of the element at the `-i` index of the `elements` list. The value of `removals` must still be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `i + 1` as per the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `s` is `s - elements[-i]`.

Output State: **`removals` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is `s - elements[-i]`**.
