Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is calculated as `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`**

In simple terms, the variable `ans` is now assigned the value of the integer division of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`) retain their initial state values.
