Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's break down the situation step by step:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `n` and `q` are integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`.
   - `x` is a list of cumulative XOR values derived from the list `a`. Specifically, `x[0] = 0` and for `i > 0`, `x[i] = x[i-1] ^ a[i-1]`.
   - `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears.
   - `q` is greater than 0, indicating there are queries to process.
   - `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`, which suggests an iterative process.
   - `lower` is `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`, indicating an index from `inds[x[r]]` that satisfies the condition `arg < l`.

2. **The Print Statement:**
   - The `print('Yes')` statement is straightforward and will print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of the variables described above.

3. **Output Analysis:**
   - The print statement is independent of the specific values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `inds`, `upper`, `i`, and `lower`. It simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **Yes**
