Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4. If `ans` was equal to '<', then `max_item_idx` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` remains unchanged. `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
