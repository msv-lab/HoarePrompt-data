Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of integers where `a[0] == a[1]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 2; `end` is 1; `ans` retains its original value**

In this output state, the value of `st` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
