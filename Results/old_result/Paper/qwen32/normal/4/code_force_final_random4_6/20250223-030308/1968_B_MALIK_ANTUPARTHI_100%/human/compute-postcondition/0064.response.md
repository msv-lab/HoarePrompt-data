Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is at least 1, `c` is the second integer read from input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new string read from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 2`, `k` is `j + 2`.**

Natural language: The value of `k` is now equal to the value of `j` which was incremented by 2. All other variables retain their previous values.
