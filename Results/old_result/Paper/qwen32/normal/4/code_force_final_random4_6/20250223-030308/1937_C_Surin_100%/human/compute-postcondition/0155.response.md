Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `n` is an integer value greater than 1, `prev` is the value determined by the user's inputs throughout the `n-1` iterations of the loop, `kp` is incremented by 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, and `v2` is `i` if `r` equals `'<'`. Otherwise, `v2` remains `i` and other variables retain their original values.**
