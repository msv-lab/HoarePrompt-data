Let's break down the `print` statement and the given initial state to determine what will be printed.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **String Formatting with `%d`:**
   - The string `'1 %d' % i` uses Python's old-style string formatting to insert the value of `i` into the string.
   - From the initial state, we know that `i` is 3.
   - Therefore, `'1 %d' % i` will be `'1 3'`.

2. **Using `*range(1, n + 1)`:**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates numbers starting from 1 up to `n` inclusive.
   - From the initial state, we know that `n` is 5.
   - Therefore, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - The `*` operator in front of `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.

3. **Combining the Results:**
   - The `print` function will first print the formatted string `'1 3'`.
   - Then, it will print each number from the unpacked range sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output:
- The string `'1 3'` followed by the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` each separated by a space.

Output: **1 3 1 2 3 4 5**
