The code snippet appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. Therefore, `queue` now includes this new tuple along with its previous contents. Other variables such as `visited`, `current`, `dist`, `start`, `target`, and `neighbor` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` contains at least one tuple of unvisited neighbors with their distances, including `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited` and now also includes the newly appended tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. `visited` contains all visited nodes, including `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`. `current` is the first node from the `queue` and `tree[current]` must have at least one more neighbor. `dist` is the distance from the `start` to `current`. `start` and `target` remain unchanged. `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.**
