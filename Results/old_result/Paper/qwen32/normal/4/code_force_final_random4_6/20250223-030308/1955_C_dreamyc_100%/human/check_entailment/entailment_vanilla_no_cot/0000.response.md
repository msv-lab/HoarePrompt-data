Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the number of ships sunk by the Kraken. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not account for the alternating attack pattern and the fact that ships are removed from the list once they sink.

Here's a more detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Attacks**: The program calculates `a` and `b` as the number of attacks on the first and last ships, respectively. However, the actual logic of alternating attacks and the removal of ships once they sink is not correctly implemented.

2. **Incorrect Sinking Logic**: The logic `if s_a <= a: ans += 1` and `if s_b <= b: ans += 1` does not correctly account for the fact that a ship can be attacked multiple times before sinking and that once a ship sinks, it is no longer part of the attack sequence.

3. **No Deque Usage**: The program uses a list to store the ship durabilities but does not use a deque or any mechanism to efficiently remove ships once they sink.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Large `k`**: The program checks if `k >= sum(nums)` and returns `n` if true, which is correct. However, the logic for handling smaller `k` values is incorrect.

To fix the program, you would need to simulate the attack sequence using a deque or a similar data structure that allows efficient removal of elements from both ends. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    q = deque(nums)
    attacks = 0
    while k > 0 and q:
        if q[0] > 0:
            q[0] -= 1
            attacks += 1
            if q[0] == 0:
                q.popleft()
        if k > attacks and q:
            if q[-1] > 0:
                q[-1] -= 1
                attacks += 1
                if q[-1] == 0:
                    q.pop()
        k -= attacks
        attacks = 0
    return n - len(q)

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version uses a deque to efficiently remove ships once they sink and correctly simulates the alternating attack pattern.
