To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n` given the initial state that `n` is an integer between 1 and 500.

1. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - The first part of the expression is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
     - This expression calculates a specific integer value based on `n`.
   - The second part of the expression is `2 * n`.
     - This expression calculates twice the value of `n`.

2. **Explanation of the Output:**
   - The first part of the output is the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
     - This formula is known to compute the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The second part of the output is `2 * n`.
     - This is simply twice the value of `n`.

3. **Detailed Output:**
   - Since `n` is a variable whose value is not explicitly provided, we describe the output in terms of `n`.
   - The first value printed is the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
   - The second value printed is twice the value of `n`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is described as follows:
Output: **the sum of squares of the first n natural numbers, 2 * n (where n is the given integer input)**
