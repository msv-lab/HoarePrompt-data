To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop for each test case and how it processes the input values `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the loop:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Reading**: For each test case, the integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are read.
3. **Sum Check**: The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is checked for oddness. If it's odd, `-1` is printed, and the loop continues to the next test case.
4. **Comparison and Calculation**:
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `p1 + p2` is printed.
   - Otherwise, a nested loop runs where `x` starts at `0` and `y` starts at `p3`. The loop decrements `y` and increments `x` until `x` is greater than `y` or the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met. If the condition is met, `p1 - x + p3` is printed and the loop breaks. If the loop exits without breaking, `p3` is printed.

The output state after all iterations will be a series of printed values, one for each test case, based on the conditions described above.

**Output State: **The output state after all iterations will be a series of printed values, each corresponding to the result of one test case. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `-1` is printed. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `p1 + p2` is printed. Otherwise, the nested loop determines the output based on the conditions `p1 - x <= p2 - y`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is a sequence of results for each test case, where each result is either `-1`, `p1 + p2`, or a value determined by the nested loop's logic.
