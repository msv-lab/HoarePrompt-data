Output State: **`k` is `j`, `i` is `b + 2`, `a` is greater than `b + 2`, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second new input integer, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the new input string, and `j` is `j + 1`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
