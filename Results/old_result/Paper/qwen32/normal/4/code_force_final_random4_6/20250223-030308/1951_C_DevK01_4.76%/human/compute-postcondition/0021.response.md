The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common placeholder for a loop that doesn't use the loop variable. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` does not affect the loop condition, we only need to adjust `t` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is `len(N)`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, and `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. If `n * m` equals `k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is `q-1`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
