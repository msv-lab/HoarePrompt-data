Reasoning:

The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix by performing a series of operations. The operations involve filling a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The program calculates the maximum sum and the sequence of operations needed to achieve this sum.

Let's break down the provided program and its logic:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum is calculated using the formula `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` from 2 to `n`. This formula is equivalent to `sum += i^3` for `i` from 1 to `n`. This is because `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1))` simplifies to `2*i - 1`, and multiplying by `i` gives `i * (2*i - 1)`, which is the difference between the sum of cubes of the first `i` natural numbers and the sum of cubes of the first `i-1` natural numbers. This simplifies to `i^3`.
   - Therefore, the sum is the sum of cubes of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3`. This sum is known to be `(n * (n + 1) / 2)^2`, which is the square of the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. This is the maximum possible sum for the matrix.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program outputs `2n` operations, as specified in the problem statement. Each operation either fills a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - The operations are designed to ensure that each number from 1 to n appears in each row and each column exactly once, which is the optimal way to maximize the sum of the matrix.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the sequence of operations.
   - The operations are generated in such a way that each row and each column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, ensuring that the sum is maximized.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly calculates the maximum sum and generates the required operations to achieve this sum within the constraint of `2n` operations.
