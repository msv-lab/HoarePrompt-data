To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes the input values.

The loop processes `t` number of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, the output is determined based on the value of `k` relative to `2 * n`:

1. If `k == 1`, the output is `1`.
2. If `k <= 2 * n`, the output is `ceil(k / 2)`.
3. If `k > 2 * n`, the output is `k // 2 + 1`.

The loop reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints the output based on the above conditions. After all `t` test cases have been processed, the loop terminates.

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is simply the set of outputs printed for each test case. Since the loop does not modify `t`, `n`, or `k` outside of the current iteration, these variables revert to their initial state at the start of each new iteration.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations is the sequence of outputs printed for each test case.

Output State: **The output state is a sequence of integers printed for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop. Specifically, for each test case with integers `n` and `k`, the output is `1` if `k == 1`, `ceil(k / 2)` if `k <= 2 * n`, and `k // 2 + 1` if `k > 2 * n`. This sequence is printed after all `t` test cases have been processed.**
