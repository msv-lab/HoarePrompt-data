To determine the new value of `sm` after the execution of the given code snippet, we need to evaluate the expression `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.

Given:
- `sm` is initially `2 * a[s]`
- `sp` is `3 * a[s]`
- `k` is `-2`
- `a` is a list of integers from the input
- `s` is an index such that `s` is `p[s] - 1`

Let's break down the expression:

1. `a[s] * k + sp` translates to `a[s] * (-2) + 3 * a[s]`, which simplifies to `a[s] * (-2 + 3)`, or `a[s] * 1`, which is simply `a[s]`.
2. The `max(sm, a[s])` function will then compare the current value of `sm` (which is `2 * a[s]`) with `a[s]`.

Since `2 * a[s]` is always greater than or equal to `a[s]` for any non-negative `a[s]`, the `max` function will return `2 * a[s]`.

Thus, `sm += max(sm, a[s])` translates to `sm += 2 * a[s]`, which means `sm` will be `2 * a[s] + 2 * a[s]`, or `4 * a[s]`.

Therefore, the updated value of `sm` is `4 * a[s]`.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `bm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a new list of integers from the input, `bm` is `2 * a[b]` if `a[b]` is non-negative, otherwise `bm` is `0`, `sm` is `4 * a[s]`, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`.**
