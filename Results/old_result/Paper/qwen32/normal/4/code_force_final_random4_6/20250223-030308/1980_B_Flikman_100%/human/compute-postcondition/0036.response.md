Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer input by the user; `k` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order; `removed_count` is 1; `favorite_count` is undefined; the current element of `sorted_a` at index `i` is equal to `favorite_value`.**

Explanation: The value of `removed_count` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
