The code calculates the value of `not_mid` using the formula `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given that `mid` is already defined as `(right - left + 1) // 2`, we can substitute this into the formula to find the value of `not_mid`.

`not_mid` is calculated as:
\[ \text{not\_mid} = (\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) - \left(\frac{\text{right} - \text{left} + 1}{2}\right) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{not\_mid} = \frac{(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1)}{2} \]

If `right - left + 1` is even, `not_mid` will be an integer. If `right - left + 1` is odd, `not_mid` will be the floor division result.

The other variables `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.**
