You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `space_x` is equal to `x * 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The problem asks to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

### Program Analysis
The program reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the minimum number of screens required as follows:

1. **Calculate Total Space Needed:**
   - `space_x = x * 1` (space needed for 1x1 icons)
   - `space_y = y * 4` (space needed for 2x2 icons)
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x` (total space needed)

2. **Calculate Screens Needed for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since each screen has 15 cells, the number of screens required to place `y` 2x2 icons is calculated as:
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even (since two 2x2 icons can fit in one screen)
     - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd (since an additional screen is needed for the remaining icon)

3. **Calculate Remaining Cells:**
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` (remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons)

4. **Determine Additional Screens Needed for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x` (space needed for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, calculate the extra space needed:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`
     - The number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons is calculated as:
       - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space` is not a multiple of 15
       - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is a multiple of 15

5. **Calculate Total Screens Needed:**
   - Total screens needed = `screen_require_for_y + extra_screen`

### Issues in the Program
The program has a logic flaw in the calculation of `extra_screen`. Specifically, the condition `if space_x % 15 == 0:` is incorrect. The correct condition should be based on the `extra_space` variable, not `space_x`. Here's the corrected part of the logic:

- If `extra_space % 15 == 0`, then `extra_screen = extra_space // 15`
- Otherwise, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`

### Corrected Code Snippet
```python
if space_x <= remaining_cells:
    result.append(screen_require_for_y)
else:
    extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
    if extra_space % 15 == 0:
        extra_screen = extra_space // 15
    else:
        extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
    result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
```

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the calculation for `extra_screen`.

Correctness: **False**
