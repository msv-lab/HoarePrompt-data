The code snippet `s = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` retains its input integer value. The new variable `s` holds the string input by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a string input by the user.**
