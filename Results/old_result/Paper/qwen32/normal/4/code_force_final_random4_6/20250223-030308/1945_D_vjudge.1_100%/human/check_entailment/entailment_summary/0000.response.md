Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. The approach taken in the `func_1` function is to calculate the suffix sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` from the end of the list to the beginning. This helps in determining the cost of bribing people to move Kirill forward in the queue.

However, the logic in the function is flawed. The function calculates the cost as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for each position `i` from `0` to `k-1`. This approach does not correctly account for the additional costs `b_k` for each person `k` between the person Kirill is bribing and Kirill's current position. The `suff` array only considers the minimum of `a` and `b` for each person, but it does not account for the additional `b` costs incurred when Kirill bribes someone and moves past them.

For example, in the second test case of the input:
```
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
The correct minimum cost should be 22, but the function might not calculate it correctly due to the incorrect handling of the `b` costs.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
