Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is a list `[1 - k, 1]`, `h` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `h` is updated to be `h + curr`. Since both `h` and `curr` are initially 0, `h` remains 0 after the operation. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `costs`, `curr`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
