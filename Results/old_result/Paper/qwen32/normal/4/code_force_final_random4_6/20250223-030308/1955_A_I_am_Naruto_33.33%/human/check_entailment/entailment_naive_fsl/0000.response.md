Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (the number of yogurts), `a` (the price for one yogurt), and `b` (the price for two yogurts on promotion). The goal is to determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.

The logic used in the program is as follows:
- If `n > 1`, it calculates two possible costs:
  - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price, i.e., `a * n`.
  - `ans2`: The cost if as many yogurts as possible are bought in pairs at the promotion price, and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price, i.e., `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
- It then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n == 1`, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt, i.e., `a`.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify if this logic covers all potential cases and edge cases:

1. **Case 1: `n == 1`**
   - The program correctly prints `a` since there's only one yogurt to buy.
   - Example: `n = 1, a = 5, b = 9` → Output: `5`.

2. **Case 2: `n` is even**
   - The program calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs at the promotion price.
   - Example: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11` → `ans1 = 20`, `ans2 = 22` → Output: `20`.

3. **Case 3: `n` is odd**
   - The program calculates the cost if all but one yogurt are bought in pairs at the promotion price, and the remaining yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - Example: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9` → `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 14` → Output: `14`.

4. **Case 4: `b >= 2 * a`**
   - If the promotion price is not cheaper than buying two yogurts at the regular price, the program should fall back to buying all yogurts at the regular price.
   - Example: `n = 4, a = 5, b = 11` → `ans1 = 20`, `ans2 = 22` → Output: `20`.

5. **Case 5: `b < 2 * a`**
   - If the promotion price is cheaper, the program should use the promotion as much as possible.
   - Example: `n = 3, a = 5, b = 9` → `ans1 = 15`, `ans2 = 14` → Output: `14`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic and potential cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for any valid input within the given constraints.
