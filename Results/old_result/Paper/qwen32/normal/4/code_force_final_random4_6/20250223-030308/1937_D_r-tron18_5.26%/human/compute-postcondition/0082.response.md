Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus two if `el` is '>', minus one if `el` is '<', and unchanged if `el` is '<' and there is no else part; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', `[0, n]` if `el` is '<', `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>' and there is an else part, and `[0, n, 2n - 1]` if `el` is '<' and there is an else part; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `el` is `s1[n - 3]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions involving `suffZero`, `preOne`, `ol`, and `zr`; `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**
