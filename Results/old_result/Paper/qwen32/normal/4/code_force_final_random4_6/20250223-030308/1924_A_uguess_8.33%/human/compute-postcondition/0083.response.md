The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `tmp`, and `ans`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly stated and does not depend on the values of these variables.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
2. This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` to the console.
3. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `tmp`, `ans`) are involved in this `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
