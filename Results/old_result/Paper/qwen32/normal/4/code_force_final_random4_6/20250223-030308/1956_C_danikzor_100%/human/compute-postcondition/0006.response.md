To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the code and the initial state:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is assigned the value of `n`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))`

Let's analyze each part of the print statement:

- `1`: This is a constant integer value.
- `i`: This variable is assigned the value of `n` from the initial state.
- `*range(n, 0, -1)`: This is a unpacked range function. The `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `1` (exclusive of 0), decrementing by 1 each time. The `*` operator unpacks this range into individual elements.

Given that `n` is at least 2, let's consider an example where `n` is 5 (since `n` can be any integer greater than or equal to 2, and 5 is a common example for illustration).

- If `n` is 5, then `i` is also 5.
- The range `range(5, 0, -1)` would generate the sequence: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Putting it all together:

- The first element printed is `1`.
- The second element printed is `i`, which is `5`.
- The remaining elements printed are the unpacked range: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

So, the output will be: `1, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1`.

To generalize this for any `n` (where `n` is at least 2):

- The first element printed is `1`.
- The second element printed is `i`, which is `n`.
- The remaining elements printed are the unpacked range from `n` down to `1`.

Therefore, the output format will be: `1, n, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1`.

Output: **1, n, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1 (where n is at least 2)**
