The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `ans2`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order obtained from the input
- `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`
- `ans2` is equal to `ans1`

After the code executes:
- `ans1` is now equal to its previous value plus `a[i]`
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order obtained from the input, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[i]`, `ans2` is equal to the initial value of `ans1`**.
