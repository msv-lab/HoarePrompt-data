The code snippet provided is:

```python
prev = i
```

This line of code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only change is the value of `prev`, which is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0, `prev` is `i`, `r` is equal to `'='`, and `r2` is equal to `'<'`.**
