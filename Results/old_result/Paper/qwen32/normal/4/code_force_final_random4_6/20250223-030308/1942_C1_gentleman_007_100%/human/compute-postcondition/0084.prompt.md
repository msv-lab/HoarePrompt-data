You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are lists of elements, where the elements are comparable (e.g., integers, characters).
def func_22(a, b):
    dp = [([0] * (len(b) + 1)) for _ in range(len(a) + 1)]
    for i in range(1, len(a) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(b) + 1):
            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
    #State: The `dp` matrix is fully populated with the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between all prefixes of `a` and `b`. The value at `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the LCS between the entire lists `a` and `b`.
    i, j = len(a), len(b)
    l = []
    while i != 0 and j != 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
            l.append(a[i])
        
    #State: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `l` contains the LCS of `a` and `b` in reverse order.
    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the LCS of `a` and `b` in reverse order, which is the same as `l`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are lists of comparable elements. It returns the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of `a` and `b` in reverse order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the LCS of `a` and `b` in reverse order, which is the same as `l`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
