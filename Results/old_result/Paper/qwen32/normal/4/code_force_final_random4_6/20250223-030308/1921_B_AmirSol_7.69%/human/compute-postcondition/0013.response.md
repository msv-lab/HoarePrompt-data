Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 1 and `i` is either 1 or 2 with specific conditions on the characters around `i`. Otherwise, `counter` remains 0 and `i` is 1 with `s1[i]` equal to `s2[i]`.**
