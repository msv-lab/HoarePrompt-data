Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob aims to sell `n` buns to maximize his profit. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1` for the `k`th bun, and the remaining `n-k` buns at the usual price `a`. We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

### Key Observations:
1. **No Discount Case (b <= a):** If the initial price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the discount would not increase the profit.
2. **Full Discount Case (b - a >= n):** If the difference `b - a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, the best strategy is to sell all buns at the modified price because the price of the last bun in the sequence will still be greater than or equal to `a`. The total profit can be calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series: \((2b - n + 1) \times n / 2\).
3. **Partial Discount Case (b - a < n):** If the difference `b - a` is less than `n`, the optimal strategy is to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price `a`. The total profit in this case is the sum of the arithmetic series for the first `b - a` buns plus the profit from the remaining buns sold at `a`.

### Solution Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code and check if it correctly implements the above logic:

- **No Discount Case:** The condition `if b <= a` correctly identifies when it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is calculated as `n * a`, which is correct.
- **Full Discount Case:** The condition `elif b - a >= n` correctly identifies when it is better to sell all buns at the modified price. The profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((2b - n + 1) \times n / 2\), which is correct.
- **Partial Discount Case:** The `else` block handles the case where the discount can be applied to some buns but not all. However, there seems to be a mistake in the formula used: `print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))`. The correct formula should sum the arithmetic series for the first `b - a` buns and add the profit from the remaining buns sold at `a`. The correct formula should be:
  \[
  \text{Profit} = \left(\frac{(b - a + 1) \times (b - a)}{2}\right) + a \times (n - (b - a))
  \]
  The provided formula incorrectly sums the series up to `b - a` and adds `a * n` for all buns, which would be incorrect for the partial discount case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code contains an error in the formula for the partial discount case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
