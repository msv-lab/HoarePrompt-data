The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'8'`. The variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` are described in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
2. The variable `a` is a list of integers obtained from an input line split by spaces.
3. The variable `z` is incremented by 1, but its value is not used in the `print` statement.
4. The variable `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
5. The variable `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string.

Since the `print` statement is `print('8')`, it will output the string `'8'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **8**
