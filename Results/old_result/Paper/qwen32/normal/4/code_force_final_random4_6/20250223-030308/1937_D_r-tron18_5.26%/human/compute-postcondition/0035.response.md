The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. Since the loop is currently at the end of the previous iteration where `i` is `n - 1`, we need to adjust `i` to the next value in the sequence for the loop to execute again.

Given the loop statement:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 2`.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop control.

State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'. `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'. `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n]` if `el` is '<'. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided. `n` is greater than 0. `i` is `n - 2`. `el` is `s1[n - 2]` (which is either '<' or '>'). `ol` is `totalOne` minus one if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`. `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'. `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `n` if `el` is '<'. `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol` is less than or equal to `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `el` is '<', `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `2 * totalOne`. `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'.**
