The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `x`. Since the initial state does not specify a value for `bx`, we assume `bx` is not defined or has a value that is less than `x` for the first comparison. After this line of code, `bx` will hold the maximum value between its previous value and `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and its previous value (or `x` if `bx` was not previously defined).**
