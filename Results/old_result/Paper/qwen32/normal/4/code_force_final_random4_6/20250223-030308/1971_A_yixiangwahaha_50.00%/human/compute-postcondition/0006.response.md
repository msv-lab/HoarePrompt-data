The code appends the integer value of `xylist[1]` to the list `y`. Therefore, `y` will now contain this new integer value. The values of `t`, `x`, and `xylist` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `xylist` is a list of substrings from the input split by spaces.**
