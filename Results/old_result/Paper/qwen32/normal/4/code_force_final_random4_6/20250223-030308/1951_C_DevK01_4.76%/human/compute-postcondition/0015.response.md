Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(N) - 1`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`, `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is the last element of the original `N`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, `cost` is `mu * w`.**

In natural language: The value of `cost` is calculated as `mu * w`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions as specified.
