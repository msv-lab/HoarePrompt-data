To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n` in this case. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

Let's break down the given state and the loop:

- **State before the loop starts:**
  - `s` is the user input string.
  - `n` is the length of the user input string.
  - `x` is -1.
  - `func_1(s[0:])` returns True.

- **Loop statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute because the range `(1, n)` would be empty.
- The variable `i` is the loop counter and starts at 1. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be set to any specific value because it is initialized by the `range` function.
- The variable `n` is already defined as the length of the string `s`, so we need to ensure that the length of `s` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 1.
- The value of `s` should be a string with at least 2 characters to make `n` greater than 1.
- The values of `x` and the result of `func_1(s[0:])` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`s` is a user input string with at least 2 characters, `n` is the length of `s` (which must be greater than 1), `x` is -1, `func_1(s[0:])` returns True**
