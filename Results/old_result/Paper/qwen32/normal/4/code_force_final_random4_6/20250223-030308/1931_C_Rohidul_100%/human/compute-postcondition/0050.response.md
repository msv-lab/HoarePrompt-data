To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the objects that are part of the loop head, which are `r` and `a[r]`.

Here's the loop condition:
```
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
```

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
1. `r > l`
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[r] == a[r - 1]`
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is an index such that `l < n - 1` and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`
- `r` is `n - 2`
- `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element
- `end` is 2
- `ans` retains its original value

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
1. `r` must be greater than `l`. Given that `r` is `n - 2`, we need to ensure `n - 2 > l`. Since `l < n - 1`, this condition is already satisfied.
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`. This condition is already satisfied as given in the state.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to decrement `r` by 1, so that `r` remains greater than `l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` still holds true.

So, we adjust `r` to `r - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is an index such that `l < n - 1` and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`, `r` is `n - 3`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is 2, `ans` retains its original value**
