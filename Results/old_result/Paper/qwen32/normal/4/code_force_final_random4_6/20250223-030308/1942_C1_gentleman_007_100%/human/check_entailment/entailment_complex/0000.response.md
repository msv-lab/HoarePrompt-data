### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out by choosing vertices to form diagonals. Given that \( y = 0 \), we can only use the vertices Bessie has already chosen.

The provided code calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the vertices Bessie has chosen. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, the number of sides of the polygon \( n \), the number of vertices Bessie has chosen \( x \), and \( y \) (which is 0) are read.
   - The vertices Bessie has chosen are read and sorted.

2. **Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The initial number of triangles is set to \( x - 2 \). This is because \( x \) vertices can form a polygon, and to form triangles, we need to connect vertices such that non-intersecting triangles are created.
   - The code iterates through the sorted list of vertices and checks for consecutive vertices that are adjacent or nearly adjacent (i.e., the difference between the indices is 1 or 2).
   - If two consecutive vertices are nearly adjacent, it increments the triangle count.
   - It also checks for specific edge cases where the first and last vertices form a nearly adjacent pair, considering the circular nature of the polygon.

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the maximum number of triangles is printed.

- **func_1, func_2:** These functions read input and convert it to a list of integers. They are not directly used in the main logic.
- **func_3, func_4, func_5, func_6, func_7, func_8:** These functions are not used in the main logic.
- **func_9, func_10, func_11, func_12, func_13, func_14, func_15, func_16:** These functions are not used in the main logic.
- **func_17, func_18, func_19:** These functions perform binary search and are not used in the main logic.
- **func_20:** This function calculates the integer square root and is not used in the main logic.
- **func_21:** This function calculates modular exponentiation and is not used in the main logic.
- **func_22:** This function finds the longest common subsequence and is not used in the main logic.
- **func_23:** This function finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence and is not used in the main logic.
- **func_24, func_25:** These functions perform depth-first and breadth-first traversals and are not used in the main logic.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the vertices Bessie has chosen. The additional functions are not relevant to solving the problem and do not affect the correctness of the solution.
