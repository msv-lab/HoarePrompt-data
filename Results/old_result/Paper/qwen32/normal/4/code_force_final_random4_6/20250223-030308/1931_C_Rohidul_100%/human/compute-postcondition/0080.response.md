Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is the new list of integers read from the input with the last two elements being equal, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is `k-1` where `k` is the length of the sequence of equal elements starting from `a[0]`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `k`, `end` is 2, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))` if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, otherwise `le - max(st, end)`**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `end`, which has been incremented by 1, making its new value 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
