Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are six integers read from the input. Additionally, `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` is now calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
