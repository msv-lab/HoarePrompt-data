The code snippet `frequency_table[num] = k` sets the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`, overriding any previous value it might have had.

Given the initial state, `frequency_table[num]` was `k + 1` if it was `k` before, otherwise `1`. After executing the code, `frequency_table[num]` is explicitly set to `k`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is now `k`; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
