Functionality: **The function `func_25` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from a given vertex `ver` in a graph. It marks all vertices reachable from `ver` as visited in the list `vis` and prints each visited vertex. The function does not return a value but modifies the `vis` list to reflect which vertices have been visited.**
