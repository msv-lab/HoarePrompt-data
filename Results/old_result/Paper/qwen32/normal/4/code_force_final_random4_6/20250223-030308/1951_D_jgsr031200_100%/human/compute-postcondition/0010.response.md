Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`.**

Explanation: The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. A new list `costs` is created with the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
