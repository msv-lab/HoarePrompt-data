Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is an element from list `a`, and `index` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which difference was maximum. The variables `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states, with `tp1` being 0, `tp2` being `m - 1`, `ans` being 0, `t` being a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` being integers read from the input, `a` being a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` being a sorted list of integers read from the input.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `max_heap` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` with one tuple removed, `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. `item` is a tuple `(-diff, i, index)` where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `i` is an element from list `a`, and `index` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on which difference was maximum. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])` and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is updated to 1, `tp2` remains `m - 1`, and `ans` is updated to `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0, `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + diff2`. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `tp1` is set to 1 and `tp2` remains `m - 1`. Otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is set to `m - 2`. If `item[2]` is neither less than `tp1` nor greater than `tp2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, then `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1 > diff2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff`. Otherwise, if `item[2]` equals `tp2`, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, i, index)` (one less than before), `t` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was the smallest in `max_heap` before the pop operation. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `ans` is increased by `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2` else `ans` is increased by `diff2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])` if `diff1 > diff2` else `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
