The given code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. The initial state specifies that `temp` is an index where `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)]) > abs(a[temp] - b[temp])` is met, and `temp` is not equal to -1, with `n` being greater than `temp`.

The code does not directly modify the value of `temp`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. It only modifies `ans` by appending a new value. Therefore, the values of `temp` and `n` remain unchanged after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`temp` is an index where `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)]) > abs(a[temp] - b[temp])` is met, and `temp` is not equal to -1, `n` must be greater than `temp`; `ans` has an additional element `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` appended to it.**
