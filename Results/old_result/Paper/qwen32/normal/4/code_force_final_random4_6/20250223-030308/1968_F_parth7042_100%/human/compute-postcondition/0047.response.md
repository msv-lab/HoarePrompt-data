The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. The loop will execute `q` times, and `_` will take on values from 0 to `q-1`.

Given that the loop head does not involve any variables that need to be modified for the loop to execute, the state remains the same except for the implicit increment of the loop counter `_`.

Here's the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop:

State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that `q` is at least 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is `int(data[3 + i - 1])` and all other elements are 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `5 + n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` is the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i` and all other elements are 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[i]`; `l` is the integer value of `data[3 + n]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[4 + n]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices where `pf` has the value `pf[l - 1]`; `it1` is the insertion index of `l` in `v1` to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the insertion index of `r` in `v2` to maintain sorted order minus 1; `results` is a list containing the string 'YES' if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`. Otherwise, `results` contains the string 'YES' if `x` equals 0, otherwise `results` contains the string 'NO'.**
