The code snippet assigns the value `y[i] - y[j]` to the variable `dy`. The values of `i`, `j`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `visited` remain unchanged except for `dy`, which is now calculated based on the difference between `y[i]` and `y[j]`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer such that 0 <= i < n; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers representing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively; `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited, and now `visited[i]` is True; `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`.**
