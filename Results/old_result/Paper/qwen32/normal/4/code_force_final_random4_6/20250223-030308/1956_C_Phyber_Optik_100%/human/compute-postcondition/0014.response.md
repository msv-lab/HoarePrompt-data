Let's break down the code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `sum` is calculated as 1 plus the sum of (2i^2 - i) for i from 2 to n, where `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is not defined in the initial state, which means it is an unknown variable in this context.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Argument (`2`)**: This is a constant integer value, so it will print `2`.
2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**: This expression involves `n` and `j`. Since `j` is not defined, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `n - j + 1`. However, we know it will be `n - j + 1`.
3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**: This will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator unpacks the range into separate arguments for the `print` function.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be:
- The first value is `2`.
- The second value is `n - j + 1` (where `j` is an undefined variable).
- The third part will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Thus, the final output format is:
Output: **2, n - j + 1, 1, 2, ..., n (where j is an undefined variable and n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
