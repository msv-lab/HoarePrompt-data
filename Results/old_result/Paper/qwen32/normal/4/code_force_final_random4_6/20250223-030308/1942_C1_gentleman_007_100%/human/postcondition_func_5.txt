The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m`, a non-negative integer representing the number of edges or connections to be made between vertices. It returns a 2D list `l` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` where all elements are `0` except for the pairs `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` which are `1` for each pair of vertices `(x, y)` returned by `func_1()` across `m` iterations.
