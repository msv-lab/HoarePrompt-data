The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state of `temp` and `ans` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, after executing the code, the values of `temp` and `ans` remain as they were in the initial state. The only changes are that `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input.

Output State: **`temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met; `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `temp - 1` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n - 1` if `temp` is not -1, otherwise `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `n - 1`; `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input.**
