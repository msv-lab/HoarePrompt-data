The loop head in the provided code snippet is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This indicates that the loop will iterate a number of times specified by the input, and the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body. Therefore, the state of the loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted because it is not referenced in the loop body.

Given the state description:
- `temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met.
- If `temp` is not -1, `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `temp - 1` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n - 1`.
- If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `n - 1`.

Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state, the state remains unchanged with respect to the loop head. The only variables that could be relevant are those that might be affected by the input, but since the loop head does not involve any of the variables mentioned in the state description (like `temp`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, `n`), we do not need to adjust any of them.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`temp` is either -1 or the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is met. If `temp` is not -1, `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `temp - 1` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n - 1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains `abs(a[j] - b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `n - 1`.**
