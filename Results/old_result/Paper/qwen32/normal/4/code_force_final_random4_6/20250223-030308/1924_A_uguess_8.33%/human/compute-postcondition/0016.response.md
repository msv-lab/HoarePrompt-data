The code snippet `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` updates the value of `cur_ss` based on the second character of the string `s`. 

Given that `ss` is the second character of `s`, the new value of `cur_ss` will be the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. This calculation will replace the previous value of `cur_ss`, which was `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`. Since `ss` is defined as `s[1]`, the value of `cur_ss` remains unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State with respect to `cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty input string, `cur_ss` is `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`. If `cur` was originally equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0. `cur` retains its original value. `ss` is the second character of `s`.**
