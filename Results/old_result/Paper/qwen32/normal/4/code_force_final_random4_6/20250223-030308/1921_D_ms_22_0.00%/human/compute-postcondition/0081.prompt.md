Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple being `(-abs(a_i - b[0]), a_i, 0)` or `(-abs(a_i - b[m - 1]), a_i, m - 1)` depending on the comparison, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples. If `item[2]` was less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and `ans` is set to the larger difference (`diff1` or `diff2`). Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by the absolute value of `item[0]`. If `item[2]` was equal to `tp1`, `tp1` is updated to 1; otherwise, `tp1` is updated to 0 and `tp2` to `m - 2`. The value of `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple after the pop operation, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple after the pop operation, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `tp1` is updated to `tp1 + 1` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `tp1` remains the same, `tp2` is updated to `tp2 - 1` if `diff1 <= diff2`, otherwise `tp2` remains the same, and `ans` is increased by `diff1` if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
