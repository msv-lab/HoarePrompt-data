The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about variables `s`, `n`, and `x`, as well as the result of the function call `func_1(s[0:])`. However, the value of `s`, the exact contents of the string, the length `n`, and the value of `x` do not affect the output of the `print` statement. The function call `func_1(s[0:])` is mentioned to evaluate to `False`, but this result is not used in the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
