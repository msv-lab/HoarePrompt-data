Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`. `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'. `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'. `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', and `[0, n]` if `el` is '<'. `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions: if `el` is '>' and `ol` (which is `totalOne`) is less than or equal to `zr` (which is `0`), then `ans[n-1]` is `- (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is `-preOne[1] + n + 1`. If `el` is '<' and `zr` (which is `1`) is less than or equal to `ol`, then `ans[n-1]` is `n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + n + 1`; otherwise, `ans[n-1]` is `n - 2 * totalOne`. `n` is greater than 0. `i` is `n - 1`. `el` is `s1[n - 1]` (which is either '<' or '>'). `ol` is `totalOne` minus one if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`. `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'. `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `n` if `el` is '<'. `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol` is less than or equal to `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise `preOne[1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `el` is '<', `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `2 * totalOne`. `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'.**
