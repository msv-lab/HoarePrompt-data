Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30; for each query, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 3; `results` is an empty list.**

The value of `index` has been incremented by 2, so it is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
