Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the sum `(a + b + c)` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`, then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the program has processed each of the `t` test cases. For each case, it checks if the sum of the three scores is odd. If it is, it outputs `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates two values: half of the sum and the sum of the first two scores, then outputs the smaller of these two values.
