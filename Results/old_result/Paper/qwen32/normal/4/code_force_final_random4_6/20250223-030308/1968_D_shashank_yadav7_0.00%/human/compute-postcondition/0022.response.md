The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is 0 if the condition `k == 0` is true; `s` is `p[s] - 1`; `b` is `p[b] - 1`; `p`, `a`, `sp`, and `sm` remain as described in the initial state; if `k` is 0, `bm` is `max(bm, bp)`; if `k` is not 0, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`; `sp` is `sp + a[s]`; `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.**
