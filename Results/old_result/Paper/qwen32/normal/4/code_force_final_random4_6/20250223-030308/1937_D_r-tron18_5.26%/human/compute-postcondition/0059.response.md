The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 3`.

State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', `[0, n]` if `el` is '<', `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>' and there is an else part, and `[0, n, 2n - 1]` if `el` is '<' and there is an else part; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `el` is `s1[n - 3]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne` minus one if `el` is '>', otherwise `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `2 * func_1([0, n], ol)` if `el` is '<'; `oneInd` is calculated differently based on conditions involving `ol` and `zr`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'. If `el` is '>', `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is '<', `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `zeroInd - oneInd` with `zeroInd` and `oneInd` calculated differently based on conditions involving `suffZero` and `preOne`.**
