To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and verify it against the problem description and the provided function summary. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Total Points**: The total points scored by all three players must be even because each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
2. **Maximum Draws**: To maximize the number of draws, we should minimize the number of 2-0 outcomes. The formula used in the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws.
3. **Invalid Scores**: If the total points are odd, it's impossible to achieve such scores with the given rules, hence the output should be `-1`.

### Program Logic:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the three scores.
2. **Odd Total Points Check**: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total points with the given rules.
3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**: The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that we maximize the number of draws by adjusting for the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 0 (no games played)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 1 (one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the first and second player, one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 6 (all games could be draws)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - Maximum draws: 2 (one draw between the first and second player, one draw between the second and third player)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Detailed Analysis of the Formula:
The formula used in the program is:
\[
\text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
\]
This formula aims to maximize the number of draws by reducing the number of 2-0 outcomes.

- **Explanation of the Formula**:
  - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points.
  - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: This part ensures that we account for the excess points of the highest scorer (`v[2]`) over the sum of the other two scores (`v[0] + v[1]`). If `v[2]` is greater than `v[0] + v[1]`, it means there must be some 2-0 games involving `v[2]` to account for the excess points.
  - Subtracting this excess from the total points and then dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and adheres to the problem constraints. The logic and the formula used are sound and consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
