To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given code snippet with the provided initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `suffZero` is `[0]`
- `ol` is `totalOne` and it is less than or equal to `zr` (which is `0`), so `ol` must be `0` because it cannot be negative.

We need to understand what `func_1` does. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we will assume that `func_1` takes two arguments and returns a value based on them. However, since `suffZero` is `[0]` and `ol` is `0`, we can infer that `func_1([0], 0)` will return `0` (a common behavior for such functions when the second argument is `0`).

Thus, `zeroInd` will be calculated as:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1([0], 0)
```
If `func_1([0], 0)` returns `0`, then:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * 0 = 0
```

The other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `el` is `s1[n - 1]` which is '>', `ol` is `0`, `zr` is `0`, and `zeroInd` is `0`.**
