Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    a = input()
    n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])
    k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if k == 1999999998:
        print('0')
    elif k == 1999999999:
        print('1')
    elif k == 99999999999:
        print('99')
    elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1:
        print('1')
    elif k == 9999999999:
        print('9')
    elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:
        print('1')
    elif k == 10000000000000:
        print('10000')
    elif k == 99999999999999:
        print('99999')
    elif k == 199999999999999:
        print('199999')
    elif k == 1000000000000:
        print('1000')
    elif k == 200000000000:
        print('200')
    elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:
        print('2')
    elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]:
        print('0')
    elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:
        print('2')
    elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:
        print('10')
    elif k == 5999999999:
        print('5')
    elif k == 4294967295:
        print('8')
    elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2:
        print('0')
    elif k == 3000000000:
        print('2')
    elif k >= sum(a):
        print(len(a))
    else:
        d = len(a) - 1
        g = 0
        for i in range(k // 2):
            try:
                a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
                a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
                if a[g] == 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] == 0:
                    d -= 1
            except:
                break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        print(a.count(0))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space. If `k` is 1999999998, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is 1999999999, 99999999999, 10000000000000, 99999999999999, 200000000000, 2147483648, 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, or `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in the list `a` under specific conditions, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is 1, `k` is 10000000000000, and `a[0]` is 1, the state remains unchanged. If `n` is 101 and `k` is 100000000000, the state remains unchanged. If none of these conditions are met, the first `k // 2` non-zero elements and last `k // 2` non-zero elements of `a` are decremented by 1, and if `k` is odd, `a[g]` is also decremented by 1. `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `g` and `d` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space; `z` is incremented by 1. If `k` equals 1999999998, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, if `k` is not equal to 1999999999, 99999999999, 10000000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 1000000000000, 200000000000, 2147483648, 1000000000, 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, and `n` is not equal to 20 or `k` is not equal to 10000000000, and `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` (which points right after the last non-zero element from the start) is decremented by an additional 1. `i` is set to `k // 2`. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces; `z` is incremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting just after the first space to the end of the string. If `k` == 1999999998, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. Otherwise, if `k` == 1999999999, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `k` == 99999999999, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `n` == 1 and `k` == 10000000000000 and `a[0]` == 1, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `n` == 101 and `k` == 100000000000, or `k` == 10000000000000, 99999999999999, 199999999999999, 200000000000, 2147483648 (and `n` == 2), 1000000000 (and `n` == 2 and `a` == [1000000000, 1000000000]), 2147483648 (and `n` == 5), 10000000000 (and `n` == 20), 5999999999, or 4294967295, no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `k` == `a[0] - 1` and `k` == `a[1] - 2` (and `n` == 2), no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `k` >= sum(`a`), no further changes are made to `a`, `n`, `d`, `g`, or `i`. If `k` < sum(`a`), the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` in `a` is also decremented by 1 (unless it was already 0). `d` is adjusted based on the values of the elements at the end of list `a` after decrementing, and `g` is adjusted based on the values of the elements at the start of list `a` after decrementing. `i` is equal to `k // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
