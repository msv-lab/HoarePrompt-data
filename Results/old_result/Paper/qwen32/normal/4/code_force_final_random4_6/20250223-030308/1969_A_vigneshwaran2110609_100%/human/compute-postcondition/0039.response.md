Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the total number of iterations, `x` is greater than `n`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, `flag` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement continues.**
