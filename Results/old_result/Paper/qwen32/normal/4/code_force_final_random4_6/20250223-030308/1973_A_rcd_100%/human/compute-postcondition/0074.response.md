Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` - 1 ≤ 499.
2. `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
4. `p3` is non-negative.
5. `x` is initialized to 0.
6. `y` is initialized to `p3`.
7. `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Analysis:
- `x` is explicitly set to 0.
- `y` is set to `p3`, but `y` is not used in the print statement.
- The print statement computes `p1 - x + p3`. Since `x` is 0, this simplifies to `p1 + p3`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p3`.

### Output:
Output: **p1 + p3 (where p1 and p3 are integers such that the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd and p3 is non-negative)**
