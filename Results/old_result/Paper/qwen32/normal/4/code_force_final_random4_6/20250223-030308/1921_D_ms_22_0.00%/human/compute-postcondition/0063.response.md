The code snippet provided increments the variable `tp1` by 1. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial state of `tp1` is not specified, so we will denote its new value as `tp1 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple after the pop operation, `item` is the tuple that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated to `ans - item[0]`, `tp1` is incremented by 1.**
