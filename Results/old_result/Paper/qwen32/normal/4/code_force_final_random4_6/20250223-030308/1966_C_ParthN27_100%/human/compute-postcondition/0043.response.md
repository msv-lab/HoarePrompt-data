The code snippet `s = set()` changes the variable `s` from a sorted list with `0` prepended to it to an empty set. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the input, `arr` is the new list of integers from the input, `s` is an empty set, `i` is either 1 if `n` was 2, or the last index reached before the loop ended, and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**
