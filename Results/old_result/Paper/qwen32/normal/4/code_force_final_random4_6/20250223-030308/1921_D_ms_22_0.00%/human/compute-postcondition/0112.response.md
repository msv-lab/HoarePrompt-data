Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `max_heap` contains tuples based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`. If `diff1` (the absolute difference between `a[t]` and `b[0]`) is greater than `diff2` (the absolute difference between `a[t]` and `b[m - 1]`), `max_heap` includes the tuple `(-diff1, a[t], 0)` and the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` includes the tuple `(-diff2, a[t], m - 1)` and the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, where `i` is the next element in the list `a`, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, and `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
