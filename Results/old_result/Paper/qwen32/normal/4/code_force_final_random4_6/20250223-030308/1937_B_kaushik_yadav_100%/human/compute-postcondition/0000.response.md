The provided code snippet only defines a variable `input` and assigns it the value of `sys.stdin.readline`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or the binary strings `a_1` and `a_2`. It only sets up a way to read input from the standard input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; the first binary string `a_11 a_12 ... a_1n` consists of `n` characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'; the second binary string `a_21 a_22 ... a_2n` consists of `n` characters, each of which is either '0' or '1'; `input` is `sys.stdin.readline`.**
