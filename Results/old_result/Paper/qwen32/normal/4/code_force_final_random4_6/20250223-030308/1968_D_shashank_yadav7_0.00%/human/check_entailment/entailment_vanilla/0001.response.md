Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, the length of the permutation, the number of turns, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment**:
   - The program correctly adjusts the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from them.

3. **Initial Scores**:
   - The program initializes the scores of Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) with the values from the array `a` at their starting positions.

4. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program then enters a loop to simulate the game for `k` turns.
   - However, there is a logical error in the loop:
     - `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` are incorrect. The `max` function here does not make sense in this context. Instead, the scores should simply be incremented by the values from array `a` at the current positions.
     - Additionally, the loop incorrectly modifies `bm` and `sm` by adding the maximum of the current score and a computed value, which does not reflect the game rules.
     - The loop should simply add `a[b]` to `bp` and `a[s]` to `sp` for each turn.
     - The loop also incorrectly modifies `sp` and `bp` by adding `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, which is redundant and leads to incorrect score calculations.

5. **Comparison of Scores**:
   - After the loop, the program correctly compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner or "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Conclusion:
The program contains logical errors in the game simulation loop. The scores are not being updated correctly according to the rules of the game. The use of the `max` function does not align with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
