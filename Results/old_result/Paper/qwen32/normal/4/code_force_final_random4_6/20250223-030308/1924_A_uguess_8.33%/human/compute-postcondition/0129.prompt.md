Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are the input integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if `cnt` is 0, otherwise the last valid character assigned (unchanged), `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times (unchanged), `i` is `i + 1` (unchanged)
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are the input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, `cur` remains unchanged, `tmp` remains the `k`-th letter in the alphabet if `cnt` was 0, and `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are the input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the integer value representing the 0-based index of `ss` in the alphabet. If `cur` was `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is updated to `0 + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is set to 2, `tmp` is the `k`-th letter in the alphabet, and `ans` is a string consisting of the `k`-th letter in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times concatenated with `tmp` and then 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times. Otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in `s`, `cur_ss` is the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.). If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is 0 and `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
