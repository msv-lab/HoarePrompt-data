To determine the correctness of the program, we need to carefully analyze the logic behind the output for each test case based on the given conditions and compare it with the problem description.

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid so that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.

Let's break down the logic in the provided code:

1. **Single Cell Colored (k == 1):**
   - If \( k = 1 \), only one diagonal needs to have a colored cell. The minimum number of cells to color is 1. This is straightforward and matches the problem requirement.

2. **Up to 2n Diagonals (k <= 2n):**
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), the code calculates the minimum number of cells to color using `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This logic is based on the idea that each cell can cover two diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, the number of cells needed is approximately \( k / 2 \), rounded up to ensure all \( k \) diagonals are covered.

3. **More than 2n Diagonals (k > 2n):**
   - If \( k > 2n \), the code calculates the minimum number of cells to color using `k // 2 + 1`. This logic is based on the observation that after covering \( 2n \) diagonals with \( n \) cells (as each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals), additional diagonals need to be covered individually, requiring one extra cell per additional diagonal beyond \( 2n \).

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **First Test Case (n = 3, k = 4):**
  - Since \( k = 4 \leq 2n = 6 \), the number of cells to color is `math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`. This matches the provided output.

- **Second Test Case (n = 3, k = 3):**
  - Since \( k = 3 \leq 2n = 6 \), the number of cells to color is `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`. This matches the provided output.

- **Third Test Case (n = 3, k = 10):**
  - Since \( k = 10 > 2n = 6 \), the number of cells to color is `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`. This matches the provided output.

- **Fourth Test Case (n = 3, k = 9):**
  - Since \( k = 9 > 2n = 6 \), the number of cells to color is `9 // 2 + 1 = 5`. This matches the provided output.

- **Fifth Test Case (n = 4, k = 7):**
  - Since \( k = 7 > 2n = 8 \), the number of cells to color is `7 // 2 + 1 = 4`. This matches the provided output.

- **Sixth Test Case (n = 7, k = 11):**
  - Since \( k = 11 > 2n = 14 \), the number of cells to color is `11 // 2 + 1 = 6`. This matches the provided output.

- **Seventh Test Case (n = 2, k = 3):**
  - Since \( k = 3 > 2n = 4 \), the number of cells to color is `3 // 2 + 1 = 2`. This matches the provided output.

The logic in the code correctly handles all the cases as per the problem statement and the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
