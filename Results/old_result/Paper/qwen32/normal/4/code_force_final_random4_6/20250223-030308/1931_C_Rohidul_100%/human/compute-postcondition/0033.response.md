The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means the list `a` will be updated based on the new input, and all other variables retain their previous values unless they depend on `a`.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` are not affected by this line of code, as the code only modifies `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is the index where the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start ends or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from the start; `end` is the length of the sequence of consecutive equal elements from `l` to the end of the list. If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`. Otherwise, `ans` retains its original value, which is `le - max(st, end)`**.
