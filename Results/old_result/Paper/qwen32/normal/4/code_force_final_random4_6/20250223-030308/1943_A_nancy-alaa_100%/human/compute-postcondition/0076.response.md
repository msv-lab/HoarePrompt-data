Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in `arr`; `first` is False.**

Explanation: The code snippet only initializes the variable `first` to `False`. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
