Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of a grid `n` and the number of moves `k`. It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing moves on the grid. Based on these moves, it calculates and prints a result for each test case. The result is `1` if the remaining unvisited cells on the grid after the moves can be visited in exactly one or zero additional moves, otherwise, it calculates the number of ways to visit the remaining cells using dynamic programming and prints this number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).**
