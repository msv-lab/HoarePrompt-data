The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current value that has just finished executing, and `n` is the upper limit of the loop.

Given that the loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Now, let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` remains the same.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration other than it being the last value that finished executing, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4. If `ans` is equal to '<', then `max_item_idx` is `i`. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` remains 0. `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, i, i)`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.** 

However, to be more precise in the format requested:

State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4. If `ans` is equal to '<', then `max_item_idx` is `i`. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` remains 0. `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, i, i)`. `i` is now 4 (if the previous `i` was 3, for example).**

But since the exact previous value of `i` is not specified, we denote the general state as:

State: **`n` is an integer representing the length of the permutation sequence, where 2 <= n <= 10^4. If `ans` is equal to '<', then `max_item_idx` is `i`. Otherwise, `max_item_idx` remains 0. `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, i, i)`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
