Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space, and `k` must be greater than 0; `c` and `r` are new integers obtained from the latest input, where `c` is the first integer and `r` is the second integer separated by a space; `i` is `i + 1`. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is 3. Otherwise, `num` is 6.**
