The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` by reading a new list of integers from the input. This means the previous values of `a` are replaced by the new input values. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `m` is any integer; `n` is an integer greater than `m`; `k` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `todo` is a set of unique integers that were in `todo` initially but have been adjusted based on the last `n - m` elements of the new `a`; `done` is a set containing all elements from the last `n - m` elements of the new `a` that were originally in `todo`; `extra` is a set containing all elements from the last `n - m` elements of the new `a` that were not in `todo`; `j` is `m`; `ans` is the number of times during the loop that the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the values provided by the input.**
