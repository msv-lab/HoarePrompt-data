Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there are three lines: two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. The next line contains the binary string a of length n, and the following line contains the binary string b of length m. It is guaranteed that the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
