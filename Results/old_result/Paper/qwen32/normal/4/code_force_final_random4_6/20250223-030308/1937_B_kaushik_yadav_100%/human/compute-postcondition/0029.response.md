Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `b` is a string read from input with no leading or trailing whitespace; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` concatenated with `a[i]` and then concatenated with `b[i]`; `i` is determined based on the value of `work`; `work` is False if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is True.**

In this output state, `ans` has been updated to include the character `b[i]` appended to its previous value, which already included `a[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `work` remain unchanged from their initial state.
