Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input. If `a > c`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `x` is set to `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is not zero, `r` is set to `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, d - x)`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is zero, `r` is set to `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is set to `max(1, b - x)`**.
