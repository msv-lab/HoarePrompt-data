The code `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. The initial state does not specify a value for `k`, so after the increment, `k` will be 1 more than its previous value. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is the new binary string input; `b` is the new binary string input; `i` is -1; `j` is less than `m`; `k` is incremented by 1.**
