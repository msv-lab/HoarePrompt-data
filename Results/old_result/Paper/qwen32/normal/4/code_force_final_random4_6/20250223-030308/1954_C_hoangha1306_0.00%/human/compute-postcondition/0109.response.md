The code snippet provided concatenates the string representation of `x` to the existing string `kq1`. 

- `a` is a string with at least one character.
- `b` is the new input string.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `q` is incremented by 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- `vt` is 1.
- `kq1` now includes the string representation of `x` appended to it.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is the original `kq1` with the string representation of `x` appended to it.**
