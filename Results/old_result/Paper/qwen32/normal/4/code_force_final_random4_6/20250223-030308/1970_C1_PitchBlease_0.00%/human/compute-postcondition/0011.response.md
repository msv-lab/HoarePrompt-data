Postcondition: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node to reach within the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes with `start` having at least one neighbor, `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, `current` is not equal to `target`. If `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and `neighbor`. If `neighbor` was already in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged.**
