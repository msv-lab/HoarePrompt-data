The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on a specific formula. Given that `i` is initially 3, the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` will be used to calculate `dp[3]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `i` is 3

Using these values:
- `dp[3] = (dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3] = 7`

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values, `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, and `dp[3]` which is 7, `i` is 3**.
