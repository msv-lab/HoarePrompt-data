The value of `x` is calculated as the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `_` is incremented by 1; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers read from the input; `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`.**
