The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list in the defaultdict `mp` at the key `pf[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `pf[2]` is `int(data[4])`. Therefore, the value 2 is appended to the list `mp[int(data[4])]`.

Since the initial state specifies that `mp[int(data[4])]` contains the list `[2]`, appending `i` (which is 2) to this list results in `mp[int(data[4])]` being `[2, 2]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` and must be at least 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` such that 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` such that 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[0]` is 0, `a[1]` is 0, `a[2]` is `int(data[4])`, and all other elements are 0; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `pf[0]` is 0, `pf[1]` is 0, `pf[2]` is `int(data[4])`, and all other elements are 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the list `[0, 1]`, `mp[int(data[4])]` contains the list `[2, 2]`; `i` is 2.**
