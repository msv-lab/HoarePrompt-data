The code snippet takes two integer inputs and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Since `coord` is initially an empty list, the expressions for `p1` and `p2` are not yet valid and should be considered as undefined until `coord` has at least four elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0; `i` is 0; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` is the first input integer; `y` is the second input integer.**
