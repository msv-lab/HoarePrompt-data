Postcondition: **`n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, and the next input value must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time. If `k` is equal to 1, the conditions remain as stated in the precondition. Otherwise, no changes are made to `n` or `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, the conditions remain as stated in the if part. Otherwise, the conditions remain as stated in the else part.**

Since both the if and else parts describe the same conditions and no changes are made to `n` or `k`, the overall postcondition simply restates the precondition and the conditions based on the if statement without any additional changes.
