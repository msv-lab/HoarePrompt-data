The code snippet provided is simply `tp2 -= 1`, which decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `item`, `ans`) are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `-n`
- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9
- `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9
- `max_heap` has one less element
- `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`
- `ans` is updated to `ans + diff`

Only `tp2` is modified. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` has one less element, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff`, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
