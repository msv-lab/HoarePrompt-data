To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variable `ans` and how many times the loop runs.

The loop runs from `i = 2` to `root`, where `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This means the loop will execute for all integers `i` from 2 up to and including `root - 1`.

In each iteration of the loop, `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`. Here, `cnt` is `i * i`.

The final value of `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 2 to `root - 1`.

Given the format of the problem, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))`**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the integer division of `(n + i)` by `i * i` for all integers `i` from 2 up to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one. The variables `n`, `m`, and `root` remain unchanged from their initial values, except that `root` is used to determine the range of the loop.
