The code snippet provided updates the value of `diff2` by recalculating it based on the absolute difference between the current element `i` from list `a` and the last element `b[m - 1]` from the sorted list `b`.

Given the initial state, `diff2` was initially set to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. The code snippet simply reassigns `diff2` to the same calculated value, which means there is no change in the value of `diff2` unless `i` has changed. Since `i` is described as the next element in the list `a`, it is assumed that `i` has a new value, and thus `diff2` is recalculated with this new value of `i`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `diff2` based on the new `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(new_i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-abs(i - b[0]), i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`. `i` is the next element in the list `a`.**
