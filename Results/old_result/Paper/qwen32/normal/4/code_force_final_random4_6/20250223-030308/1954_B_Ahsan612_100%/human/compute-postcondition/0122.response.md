Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive equal elements in the list `a`. If all elements in the list are the same or if there is only one element, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the determined minimum length for each test case.**
