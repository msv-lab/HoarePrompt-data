Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. It returns `None` if the remainder of `extroverts` divided by 3, when added to `universals`, is less than 3. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.**
