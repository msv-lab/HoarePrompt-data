The code `ver = q.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque `q` and assigns it to the variable `ver`. Given the initial state, `q` contains only the element `ver`, so after this operation, `q` will be empty. The value of `ver` remains the same since it is reassigned to the value it already holds, which is the element that was popped from `q`.

Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary (or list of lists) where each key (or index) is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `vis` is a list where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` is an empty deque, `vis[ver]` is 1.**
