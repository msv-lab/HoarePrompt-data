Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The program is supposed to perform binary search after potentially performing up to two swaps to ensure that the element `x` is found at the correct position `p_l` after the binary search. However, the binary search is not being executed correctly, and the logic for determining the swaps is incorrect.

2. **Swap Logic**: The program checks if the index `l` after the binary search is equal to the index of `x` in the array. If not, it performs a single swap. However, this logic is flawed because it only checks for one possible swap, and the problem statement allows up to two swaps. Additionally, the logic does not account for the fact that after the first swap, a second swap might be necessary to ensure the correct position of `x` after the binary search.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the number of swaps and the indices to swap directly within the `func_1` function. This is inconsistent with the expected format, as the main loop is supposed to print the results.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where multiple swaps are necessary or where no swaps are needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_swaps_to_position_x(array, x):
    n = len(array)
    target_index = array.index(x)
    
    # Binary search to find the final position of l
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= x:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # If l is already at the correct position
    if l == target_index:
        return 0, []
    
    # First swap to bring x to the correct position
    swaps = [(target_index + 1, l + 1)]
    array[l], array[target_index] = array[target_index], array[l]
    
    # Re-run binary search to find the new position of l
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= x:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # If l is still not at the correct position, perform a second swap
    if l != target_index:
        new_target_index = array.index(x)
        swaps.append((new_target_index + 1, l + 1))
        array[l], array[new_target_index] = array[new_target_index], array[l]
    
    return len(swaps), swaps

t = int(input())
results = []
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    num_swaps, swaps = find_swaps_to_position_x(array, x)
    results.append(str(num_swaps))
    for swap in swaps:
        results.append(f"{swap[0]} {swap[1]}")
    t -= 1

print("\n".join(results))
```

This corrected program ensures that up to two swaps are performed if necessary, and it correctly handles the binary search to find the final position of `l`.
