The code snippet increments the variable `same` by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 3; `i` is 3; `same` is increased by 1.**
