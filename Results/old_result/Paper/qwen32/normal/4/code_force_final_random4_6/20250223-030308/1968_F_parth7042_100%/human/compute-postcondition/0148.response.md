Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`; `q` is an integer value of `data[index - 3]` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the integer values of `data[index - 4]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 6`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the subsequent `n` elements are the cumulative XOR of `a[j]` for `j` from 1 to `i`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[i]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO', with the last element being 'NO'; `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[r]`; `v2` is the list of indices `i` where the cumulative XOR up to `i` is `pf[l - 1]` (reassigned to `mp[pf[l - 1]]`); `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `q` is `q - 1`; `it1` is the insertion point of `l` in `v1` found using `bisect_left`.**

In simpler terms: The output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the `results` list now includes an additional element, which is the string 'NO'. All other variables retain their initial values.
