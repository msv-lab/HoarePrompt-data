Reasoning:
1. **Number of Test Cases Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not use it. Instead, the loop is hardcoded to run 10 times. This is a critical issue because the number of test cases can vary between 1 and 100 as per the problem statement. The program will fail if the number of test cases is not exactly 10, which is a direct violation of the problem requirements.

2. **Reading and Storing Input**: The program correctly reads each pair of integers `x` and `y` for each test case and stores them in separate lists `x` and `y`. However, this is only valid if there are exactly 10 test cases. For any other number of test cases, this part of the code would also be incorrect.

3. **Printing Minimum and Maximum**: The program correctly iterates over the lists and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair in the required format, assuming the lists are correctly populated with the right number of test cases.

4. **Annotations**: The annotations confirm that the program loops 10 times to read and store the values and then loops 10 times to print the results. This aligns with the issue highlighted in the original assessment.

Given these points, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the variable number of test cases as specified in the problem description. The hardcoded loop is a significant flaw that prevents the program from being correct.

Final: **False**
