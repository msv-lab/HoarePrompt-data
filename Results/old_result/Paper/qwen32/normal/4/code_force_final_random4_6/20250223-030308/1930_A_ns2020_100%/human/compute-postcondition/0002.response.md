The code snippet `n = int(input())` will overwrite the previous value of `n` with a new integer value provided by the input. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `n` as an integer input, while `t` and `a` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the new input integer, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7.**
