The code snippet provided pushes a new tuple into `max_heap` using `heapq.heappush`. The tuple contains `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. Since `diff2` is defined as `abs(new_i - b[m - 1])`, and `i` is the next element in the list `a`, the tuple being pushed will be `(-abs(new_i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `max_heap` now contains an additional tuple.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is at least 1, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing a tuple and an additional tuple `(-abs(new_i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(new_i - b[m - 1])`.**
