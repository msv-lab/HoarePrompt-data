The code snippet provided is `cur -= 1`, which means the value of `cur` will be decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n
- `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n
- `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input
- `L` is a list of integers read from the input
- `R` is a list of integers read from the input
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`
- `L[0]` is equal to 1
- `R[0]` is equal to `N`
- At least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`
- `M1` is greater than 1, `cur` is `M1 - 3` if `i` equals `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` remains `M1 - 2`
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`
- `i` is `L[-1] - 3`
- `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 5

After executing `cur -= 1`, the value of `cur` will be `cur - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= p_i <= n, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= s_i <= n, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are assigned the values from the input, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `R` is a list of integers read from the input, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, `L[0]` is equal to 1, `R[0]` is equal to `N`, at least one of the following conditions is true: `M1` is not greater than 1, `M2` is not greater than 1, or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`, `M1` is greater than 1, `cur` is `cur - 1`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is `L[-1] - 3`, `L[-1]` must be greater than or equal to 5.**
