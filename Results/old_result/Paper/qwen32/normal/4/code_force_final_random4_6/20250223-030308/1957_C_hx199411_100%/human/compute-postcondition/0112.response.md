The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, `c`, or `r` mentioned in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The variable `t` is initialized to `0`.
2. The variables `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
3. The variable `num` is the total increment based on the `c` and `r` values (though `c` and `r` are not defined in the initial state, this detail is irrelevant to the `print` statement).
4. The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num` and is not equal to `0`. The current value of `m` is given as `1`.
5. Despite the values of these variables, the `print` statement does not reference any of them.

Therefore, the `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
