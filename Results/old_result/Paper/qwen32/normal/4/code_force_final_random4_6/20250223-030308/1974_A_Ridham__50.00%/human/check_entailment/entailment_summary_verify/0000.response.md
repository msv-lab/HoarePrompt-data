### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution. We will check the logic used in the program against the problem description and the provided examples.

#### Key Points to Evaluate:
1. **Handling of 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons by dividing `y` by 2 and rounding up.
   - This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells. Thus, two 2x2 icons can fit on one screen, and any odd number of 2x2 icons will require one extra screen.

2. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
   - This is done by subtracting the total space occupied by 2x2 icons from the total available cells on those screens.

3. **Handling of 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if the remaining cells are sufficient for the 1x1 icons.
   - If not, it calculates additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - The calculation for additional screens is done by dividing the extra space required by 15 (the total cells per screen) and rounding up.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
  - 1 2x2 icon requires 1 screen (4 cells used, 11 cells remaining).
  - 1 1x1 icon can fit in the remaining 11 cells.
  - Result: 1 screen.

- **Test Case 2**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
  - 2 2x2 icons require 1 screen (8 cells used, 7 cells remaining).
  - 7 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining 7 cells.
  - Result: 1 screen.

- **Test Case 3**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
  - 4 2x2 icons require 2 screens (16 cells used, 14 cells remaining).
  - 12 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining 14 cells.
  - Result: 2 screens.

- **Test Case 4**: `x = 0`, `y = 3`
  - 3 2x2 icons require 2 screens (12 cells used, 18 cells remaining).
  - Result: 2 screens.

- **Test Case 5**: `x = 1`, `y = 0`
  - 1 1x1 icon requires 1 screen.
  - Result: 1 screen.

- **Test Case 6**: `x = 8`, `y = 1`
  - 1 2x2 icon requires 1 screen (4 cells used, 11 cells remaining).
  - 8 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining 11 cells.
  - Result: 1 screen.

- **Test Case 7**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`
  - No icons require 0 screens.
  - Result: 0 screens.

- **Test Case 8**: `x = 2`, `y = 0`
  - 2 1x1 icons require 1 screen.
  - Result: 1 screen.

- **Test Case 9**: `x = 15`, `y = 0`
  - 15 1x1 icons require 1 screen.
  - Result: 1 screen.

- **Test Case 10**: `x = 8`, `y = 2`
  - 2 2x2 icons require 1 screen (8 cells used, 7 cells remaining).
  - 8 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining 7 cells.
  - Result: 1 screen.

- **Test Case 11**: `x = 0`, `y = 9`
  - 9 2x2 icons require 5 screens (36 cells used, 75 cells remaining).
  - Result: 5 screens.

### Conclusion

After a detailed analysis, the program correctly handles all the provided test cases and edge cases. The logic for calculating the number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons is accurate.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**
