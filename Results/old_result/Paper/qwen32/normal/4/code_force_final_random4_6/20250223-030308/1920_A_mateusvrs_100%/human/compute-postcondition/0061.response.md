The code `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of the current values of `x` and `ax`. Given that `a` is an integer equal to 2, `x` is an integer read from the input, and `n` must be greater than 0, the only variable affected by this code is `ax`.

If `x` is less than `ax`, `ax` will be updated to the value of `x`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `ax` will remain unchanged.

Since the initial value of `ax` is not specified, we can only describe the final state of `ax` in terms of `x` and the original `ax`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `a` is an integer equal to 2, `x` is an integer read from the input, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the original value of `ax`.**
