The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is 0
- `n` and `k` are integers from the input, with `k` greater than 0
- `num` is either 1 or 2
- `m` is equal to `n - num`
- `c` and `r` are integers from the input, with `c` equal to `r` if `num` is 1, otherwise `c` is not equal to `r`

At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value, and `k` remains unchanged as it determines the total number of iterations.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input where `k` is greater than 0, `num` is either 1 or 2, `m` is equal to `n - num`, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, and `c` is equal to `r` if `num` is 1, otherwise `c` is not equal to `r`, `i` is incremented by 1**
