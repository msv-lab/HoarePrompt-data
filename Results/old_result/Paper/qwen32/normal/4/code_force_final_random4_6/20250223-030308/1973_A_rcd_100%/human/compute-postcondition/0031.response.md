Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is decreased by 1 while still ensuring `y` is at least `x`.**
