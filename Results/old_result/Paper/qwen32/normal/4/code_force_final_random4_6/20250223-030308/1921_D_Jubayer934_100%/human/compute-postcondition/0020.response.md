Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `ans` includes the values `abs(a[0] - b[0])` and `abs(a[1] - b[1])`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` is greater than `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains unchanged.**
