Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, `ans` is `ans + abs(item[0])`. If `item[2]` was equal to `tp1` (which was 0 and is now 1), then `tp1` is 1. Otherwise, `tp1` is 0 and `tp2` is `m - 2`. The value of `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive.**
