Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a list of integers derived from the input string.
   - `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
   - `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space, and its current value is 1999999998.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('0')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement directly outputs the string `'0'`.
   - The values of `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not influence the output of this specific print statement because the statement is hardcoded to print the string `'0'`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'0'`.

Therefore, the final output is:

Output: **0**
