The code snippet provided is `y -= pairs`, which means the value of `y` is decreased by the value of `pairs`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true + gap`
- `gaps` remains a non-empty sorted list
- `pairs` is `gap // 2`
- `gap` is the next element in `gaps`

The only variable that gets affected by the code is `y`. Since the initial value of `y` is not provided, we will denote the new value of `y` as `y - pairs`.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true + gap`; `gaps` remains a non-empty sorted list; `pairs` is `gap // 2`; `gap` is the next element in `gaps`; `y` is decreased by `pairs`.**
