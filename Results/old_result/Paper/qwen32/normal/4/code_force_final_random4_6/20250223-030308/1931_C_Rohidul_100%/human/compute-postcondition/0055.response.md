The code snippet provided only modifies the value of the variable `end` by incrementing it by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[r] == a[r - 1]`
- `le` is the length of the list `a`
- `l` is an index such that `l < n - 1` and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`
- `r` is `n - 4`
- `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element
- `end` is 3
- `ans` retains its original value

After executing `end += 1`, the value of `end` changes from 3 to 4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from the input with `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `le` is the length of the list `a`, `l` is an index such that `l < n - 1` and `a[l] != a[l + 1]`, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element, `end` is 4, `ans` retains its original value**.
