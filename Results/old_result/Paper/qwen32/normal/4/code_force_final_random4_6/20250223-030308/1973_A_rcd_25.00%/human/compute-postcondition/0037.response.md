The code snippet assigns values to `low` and `high` based on the minimum and maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. The other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`) are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers obtained from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**
