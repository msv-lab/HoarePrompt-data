The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('-1')
```

This statement will print the string `-1` regardless of the values of the variables `t` and `v` as defined in the initial state. The initial state provides conditions and information about the variables `t` and `v`, but these do not affect the output of the `print` statement because it is printing a fixed string `-1`.

Output: **-1**
