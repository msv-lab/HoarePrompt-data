Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the provided state to determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration to proceed.

The `while` loop condition is `r - l > 1`. This means that for the loop to execute, the difference between `r` and `l` must be greater than 1.

Given state:
- `array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`.
- `n` is the length of the array.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n`.

For the loop to execute, `r - l > 1` must be true. Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`, the condition becomes `n > 1`. 

Thus, the only variable we need to adjust is `n` to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the length of the array, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`**
