The `print(-1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. The precondition specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, and that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers whose sum is odd. However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
