Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi * 2 <= k`, `t` is 5 if the loop breaks due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `t` is `k % 2` from the last iteration; `T` is non-zero and `T` is decreased by 1; `a` is the list of integers from the input with `a[0]` decreased by `mi`; `l` is 0; `ans` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` and satisfies `mi * 2 <= k`.**

In this output state, the value of `a[0]` has been decreased by `mi`. All other variables retain their initial conditions unless explicitly stated otherwise.
