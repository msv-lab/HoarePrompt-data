To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over the elements in the list `gaps`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `gaps` is in a state that allows the loop to execute.

The loop will execute if `gaps` contains at least one element. The state of `ans` does not directly affect whether the loop executes, but it is part of the initial state, so we will include it in the final state description.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`gaps`**: The loop will execute if `gaps` has at least one element. Therefore, `gaps` must be a non-empty list.
2. **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is given as `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`. Since this value does not affect the execution of the loop, it remains as it is.

Given this, the adjusted state should ensure that `gaps` is a non-empty list. We can choose to initialize it with a single element, for example, `[1]`, to ensure the loop will execute.

State: **`ans` is `x - 2 + number_of_times_condition_is_true`, `gaps` is a non-empty sorted list, e.g., `[1]`**
