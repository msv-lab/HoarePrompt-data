You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer greater than 1.
def func_11(num):
    prime = [(True) for i in range(num + 1)]
    Highest_Prime = [(0) for i in range(num + 1)]
    Lowest_Prime = [(0) for i in range(num + 1)]
    prime[0] = prime[1] = False
    p = 2
    while p <= num:
        if prime[p] == True:
            Lowest_Prime[p] = p
            Highest_Prime[p] = p
            for i in range(2 * p, num + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
                Highest_Prime[i] = p
                if Lowest_Prime[i] == 0:
                    Lowest_Prime[i] = p
        
        p += 1
        
    #State: `num` is an integer greater than 1; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` boolean values where `prime[i]` is `True` if `i` is a prime number and `False` otherwise; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` integers where `Highest_Prime[i]` is the highest prime factor of `i`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` integers where `Lowest_Prime[i]` is the smallest prime factor of `i`; `p` is greater than `num`.
    p = []
    for i in range(num + 1):
        if prime[i]:
            p.append(i)
        
    #State: `num` is an integer greater than 1; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` boolean values; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` integers; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` integers; `p` is a list of all prime numbers from 2 to `num`.
    return p
    #The program returns the list `p` which contains all prime numbers from 2 to `num`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `num`, which is an integer greater than 1, and returns a list `p` containing all prime numbers from 2 to `num`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `p` which contains all prime numbers from 2 to `num`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
