The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` by comparing it with `x` and assigning the maximum of the two values to `bx`. Given the initial state, `bx` is initially set based on the value of `a` and `x`. After executing the code snippet, `bx` will hold the maximum value between its initial value and `x`.

Let's break down the possible initial values of `bx`:
- If `a` equals 1, `bx` is initially set to `max(x, -1)`.
- If `a` equals 2, `bx` is initially set to `-1`.
- If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` is initially set to `-1` (based on the provided description).

After executing the code snippet:
- If `a` equals 1, `bx` will be `max(x, max(x, -1))`, which simplifies to `x` if `x` is greater than `-1`, otherwise it remains `max(x, -1)`.
- If `a` equals 2, `bx` will be `max(x, -1)`.
- If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `bx` will be `max(x, -1)`.

In all cases, `bx` will be updated to the maximum of its initial value and `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `x` is the second integer from the new input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and its initial value**.
