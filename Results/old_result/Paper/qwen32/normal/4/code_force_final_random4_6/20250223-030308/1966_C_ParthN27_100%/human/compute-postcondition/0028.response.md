Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` with `0` prepended to it, `i` is 1. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.**
