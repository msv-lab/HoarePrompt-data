Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers representing the array). The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements.**
