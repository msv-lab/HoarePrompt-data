Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0, n]` if `el` is '<', `[0, n - 1]` if `el` is '>', `[0, n, n + (n - 3) + 1]` if `el` is '<' and there is an else part, or `[0, n, 2n - 1, (n - 3) + 1]` if `el` is '<' and there is an else part, or `[0, n - 1, (n - 3) + 1]` if `el` is '>' and there is an else part, or `[0, (n - 3) + 1]` if `el` is '>' and there is no else part; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `el` is `s1[n - 3]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` is `3n - 2` if `el` is '<' and `suffZero` is `[0, n, n + (n - 3) + 1]`, `3n - 3` if `el` is '<' and `suffZero` is `[0, n, 2n - 1, (n - 3) + 1]`, `2n - 3` if `el` is '>' and `suffZero` is `[0, n - 1, (n - 3) + 1]`, `n - 2` if `el` is '>' and `suffZero` is `[0, (n - 3) + 1]`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol` is greater than `zr` and `el` is '>'; `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` based on the given conditions. All other variables retain their previous values.
