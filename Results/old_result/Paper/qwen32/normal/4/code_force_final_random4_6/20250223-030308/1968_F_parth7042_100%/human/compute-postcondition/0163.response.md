The given code snippet modifies the `mp` dictionary by appending the value of `i` to the list associated with the key `pf[i]`. Here's the updated state:

- `mp[pf[i]]` now includes `i` in its list.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is 1 and `pf[1]` is `int(data[index])`, the list `mp[pf[1]]` will have `1` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value of `data[0]` decremented by 2; `n` must be at least 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[1]` which is `int(data[index])`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is `index + 5`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element is 0 except `pf[1]` which is `int(data[index])`; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]` and `mp[pf[1]]` contains the value `[1]`; `results` is a list containing the result of each of the `q` queries, either 'YES' or 'NO'; `i` is 1.**
