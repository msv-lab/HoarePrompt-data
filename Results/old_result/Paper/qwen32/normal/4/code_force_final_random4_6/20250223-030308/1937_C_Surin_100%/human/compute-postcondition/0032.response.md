The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, this command does not affect any of the variables in the program. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `prev` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the input `r` was `<`. If no `r` was `<`, `v1` is 0, `prev` is 0**.
