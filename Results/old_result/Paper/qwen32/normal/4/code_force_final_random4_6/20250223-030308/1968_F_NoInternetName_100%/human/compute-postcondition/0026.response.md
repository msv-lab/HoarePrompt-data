Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine what will be printed when the `print('No')` statement executes. Let's break down the information provided:

- `n` and `q` are integers.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l < r \leq n\).
- `x` is a list containing \(n+1\) elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point.
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears.
- `q` is greater than 0.
- `lower` is an integer determined by the indices in `inds[x[r]]` and the condition `arg < l`.
- `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`.
- `upper` is not greater than `lower`.

The code snippet provided is a simple `print('No')` statement. This statement does not depend on the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `inds`, `lower`, or `upper`. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print('No')` statement is straightforward and does not require any further computation or description of the variables.

Output: **No**
