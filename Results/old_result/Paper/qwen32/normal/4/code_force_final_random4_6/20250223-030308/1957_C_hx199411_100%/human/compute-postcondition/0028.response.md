Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space.
- `num` is the sum of 1 for each iteration where `c == r` and 2 for each iteration where `c != r`.
- `i` is equal to `k`.
- `m` is equal to `n - num`.
- `m` is explicitly set to 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Variables (`t`, `n`, `k`)**:
   - `t` is an integer ranging from 0 to 9,999.
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, separated by a space.

2. **Variable Definitions**:
   - `num` is defined as a sum based on the conditions `c == r` and `c != r`. However, the exact values of `c` and `r` are not provided, so we can't determine the exact value of `num`.
   - `i` is set to the value of `k`.
   - `m` is initially defined as `n - num`, but it is immediately reassigned to 1.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(1)` statement will print the integer `1`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, and `m`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
