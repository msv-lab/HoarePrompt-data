The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. 

Given the initial state, `old` is `a[2]` and it is not in `extra`. Therefore, attempting to remove `old` from `extra` will result in a `ValueError` because the element is not found in the list. However, since the task specifies to simulate the execution and does not account for exceptions, we will assume that the operation is successful for the sake of the exercise.

Thus, after the operation, `extra` will no longer contain `old`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer greater than `m`, `k` is the integer provided by the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `j` is `m-1`, `r` is `m + 2`, `old` is `a[2]`, `extra` does not contain `old`, if the length of `done` is less than `k`, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` is 3**.
