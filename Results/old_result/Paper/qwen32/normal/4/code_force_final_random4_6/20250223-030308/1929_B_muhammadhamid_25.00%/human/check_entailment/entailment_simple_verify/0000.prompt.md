You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and k such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:

            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: The output state is a sequence of integers printed for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop. Specifically, for each test case with integers `n` and `k`, the output is `1` if `k == 1`, `ceil(k / 2)` if `k <= 2 * n`, and `k // 2 + 1` if `k > 2 * n`. This sequence is printed after all `t` test cases have been processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective**: Minimize the number of colored cells in an \(n \times n\) grid such that at least \(k\) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- **Total Diagonals**: \(4n - 2\) (both main diagonals and anti-diagonals).
- **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with grid size \(n\) and required diagonals \(k\).
- **Output**: Minimum number of cells to color for each test case.

### Program Analysis
The program given is:
```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

### Testing the Program
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases to see if it meets the requirements.

#### Provided Examples:
1. **Input**: `3 4`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: The program correctly calculates `math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.
   
2. **Input**: `3 3`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: The program correctly calculates `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
   
3. **Input**: `3 10`
   - **Output**: `6`
   - **Explanation**: The program correctly calculates `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
   
4. **Input**: `3 9`
   - **Output**: `5`
   - **Explanation**: The program correctly calculates `9 // 2 + 1 = 5`.
   
5. **Input**: `4 7`
   - **Output**: `4`
   - **Explanation**: The program correctly calculates `math.ceil(7 / 2) = 4`.
   
6. **Input**: `7 11`
   - **Output**: `6`
   - **Explanation**: The program correctly calculates `11 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
   
7. **Input**: `2 3`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: The program correctly calculates `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.

#### Additional Edge Cases:
1. **Input**: `2 1`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: The program correctly handles `k == 1` case.
   
2. **Input**: `2 2`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: The program incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2`. This is because for `k = 2`, the program should output `2` as coloring one cell can only cover at most 2 diagonals in a \(2 \times 2\) grid.
   
3. **Input**: `2 3`
   - **Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: The program correctly calculates `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.

### Conclusion
The program fails for the edge case where `n = 2` and `k = 2`. In this case, the program outputs `1`, but at least two diagonals need to have colored cells, which requires coloring at least two cells.

**Correctness: False**

### Explanation of Failure
The issue arises because the formula used in the program does not correctly account for the specific constraints of small grid sizes. For `n = 2`, the grid has only 4 diagonals, and the logic for `k <= 2 * n` needs to be more nuanced to handle cases where `k` is close to the total number of diagonals.
