### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to find the maximum possible length \( k \) such that the first \( k \) characters of string \( a \) form a subsequence of string \( b \). The program iterates through each test case, using a two-pointer technique to check if the characters of \( a \) can be found in \( b \) in the same order.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` points to the current character in string \( a \).
   - `j` points to the current position in string \( b \).
   - `c` keeps track of the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

2. **Iteration**:
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as both `i` is less than the length of \( a \) and `j` is less than the length of \( b \).

3. **Character Matching**:
   - Inside the loop, `func_1` is called with the current positions `i` and `j`. This function searches for the character \( a[i] \) in the substring of \( b \) starting from position `j`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not -1), it means the character \( a[i] \) was found in \( b \) starting from position `j`. The program then updates `j` to the position right after the found character, increments `i` to check the next character in \( a \), and increments `c` to reflect the matched character.
   - If `func_1` returns -1, it means the character \( a[i] \) is not found in the remaining part of \( b \) starting from position `j`. The loop breaks, and the program moves to the next test case.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing each test case, the program outputs the value of `c`, which is the length of the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the position of a character in a substring, and the main loop correctly uses this function to determine the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \).

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum \( k \) such that the first \( k \) characters of \( a \) form a subsequence of \( b \). It handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement, including when \( a \) is not a subsequence of \( b \) at all (in which case the output is 0).

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
