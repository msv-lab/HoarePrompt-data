The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the variable `cur` by the value of `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss` bits. This operation is equivalent to adding `2^cur_ss` to `cur`.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `i`, `cur_ss`, and `ss` remain unchanged except for `cur`. The new value of `cur` will be its previous value plus `2^cur_ss`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are input integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `cur_ss` is the zero-based index of `s[next_index]` in the alphabet, `ss` is `s[next_index]`, `cur` is its previous value plus `2^cur_ss`**.
