Output State: **`t` is `-n`, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ `m` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input where each `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers read from the input where each `b_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9, `max_heap` has one less element, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, a[i], index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated by adding `diff1` to it, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp1` is incremented by 1`**

Natural language: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding `diff1` to it. All other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
