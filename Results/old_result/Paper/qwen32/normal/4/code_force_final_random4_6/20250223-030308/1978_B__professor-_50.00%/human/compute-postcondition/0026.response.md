To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the initial state and the conditions provided in the loop body. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: `t` is the number of test cases. `n`, `a`, and `b` are undefined initially.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input.
   - Depending on the values of `a` and `b` relative to `n`, a specific calculation is performed and printed:
     - If `b <= a`, the output is `n * a`.
     - If `b - a >= n`, the output is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `2*b - n + 1` with a common difference of `-1`, which simplifies to `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
     - If `b - a < n`, the output is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference of `1`, plus `a * n`, which simplifies to `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

3. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - The loop will execute exactly `t` times.
   - For each of the `t` test cases, the appropriate calculation will be performed based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` read from the input, and the result will be printed.
   - The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will be redefined in each iteration, but after the loop completes, they will hold the values from the last test case.

The output state after all the iterations will be the final values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the last test case, and the loop counter `_` will be equal to `t`.

**Output State**: **`t` test cases have been processed, and `n`, `a`, `b` hold the values from the last test case.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, the loop has processed all `t` test cases, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the values from the last test case processed.
