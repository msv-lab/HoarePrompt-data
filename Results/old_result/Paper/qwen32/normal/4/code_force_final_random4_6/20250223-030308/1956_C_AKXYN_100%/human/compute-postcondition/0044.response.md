The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop's execution. The loop's continuation depends on the value provided by `int(input())`. 

Given that the loop head does not directly involve `t`, `n`, `mat`, `res`, or `i`, we cannot adjust these variables to affect the loop's execution directly. However, we can infer that the loop will execute as many times as the integer input provided. Since we are asked to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to assume that the input has already been provided and the loop is about to start its next iteration.

Thus, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, `mat`, `res`, and `i` remains unchanged at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is 5, `mat` is a list of 5 lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to 5, `res` is 95, `i` is 1**
