The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer read from input such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `x` is an input integer.**
