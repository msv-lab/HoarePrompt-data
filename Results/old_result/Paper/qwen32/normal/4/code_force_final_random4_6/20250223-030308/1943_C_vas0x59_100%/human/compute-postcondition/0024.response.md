The code snippet assigns the return value of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. The initial state indicates that `a` is already assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`. Therefore, the value of `b` will be the same as the value of `a`.

The output state will reflect this new assignment, while the other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices that are directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is the list of distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the tree, as returned by the `bfs` function; `a` is assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex for each vertex in the shortest path tree from vertex `a`, as returned by the `bfs` function; `b` is assigned the return value of `func_1(d)`**.
