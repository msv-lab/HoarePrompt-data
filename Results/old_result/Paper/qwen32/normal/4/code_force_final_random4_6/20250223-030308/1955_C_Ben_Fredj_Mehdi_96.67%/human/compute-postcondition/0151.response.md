The code snippet `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` modifies the last element of the list `a` by decrementing it by 1. Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers where the first element `a[0]` is decremented by 1 and the last element `a[d]` is decremented by 1; `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space; `k` is an integer value of at least 2; `z` is incremented by 1; `d` is `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 0; `i` is 0**

In simpler terms, the last element of the list `a` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.
