The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `r`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, `r` is an empty list, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input.**
