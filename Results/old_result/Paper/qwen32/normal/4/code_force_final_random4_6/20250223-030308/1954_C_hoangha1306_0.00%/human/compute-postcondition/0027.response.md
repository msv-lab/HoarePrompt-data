Postcondition: **`x` and `y` are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and they have the same length; `t` is greater than 0; `a` is the value of the user input and has a length greater than 0; `b` is the value of the user input; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to that character. Otherwise, if `vt` was originally 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of the minimum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to an integer, `kq2` is set to the string representation of the maximum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to an integer, and `vt` is set to 1. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`. In both cases, `x` is the minimum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to integers, and `y` is the maximum of the `i`th element of `a` and `b` converted to integers.**
