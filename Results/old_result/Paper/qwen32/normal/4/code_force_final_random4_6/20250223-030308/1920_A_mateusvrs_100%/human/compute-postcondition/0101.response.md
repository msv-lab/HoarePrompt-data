Output State: **`ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the largest value from constraints of type 1, `cx` is an empty set, `r` is either `[0, 0]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 0]` or `[0, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` or `[1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp, 1000000007 - bx + 1 - tmp]` depending on the conditions, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `ax` is updated to 1000000007. The values of `bx`, `cx`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged based on the given initial state.
