Output State: **`n` and `q` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, `l` and `r` are integers returned by `func_1(int)`, `x` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique value in `x` and the value is a list of indices in `x` where that value appears, `q` is greater than 0, `lower` is an integer determined by the indices in `inds[x[r]]` and the condition `arg < l`, `upper` is the index from `inds[x[l - 1]]` that satisfies the condition `arg <= r` as processed by `func_3`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, then `upper` is greater than `lower`. Otherwise, `upper` is not greater than `lower`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in the provided code snippet does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `i` being incremented by 1 as specified in the initial state description.
