Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer separated by a space.**

In simple terms, after running the code, `n` and `k` are assigned integer values from the input, with `n` being the first number and `k` being the second number separated by a space. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was an input integer within the range 0 to 9,999.
