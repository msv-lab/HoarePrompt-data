Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices where '>' appears in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, minus one if `el` is '>', and unchanged if `el` is '<'; `preOne` is a list starting with `0` followed by the cumulative sums of the elements in `pre`, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list defined based on the value of `el` and other conditions; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n-1]` which is calculated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - 3`; `el` is `s1[n - 3]` (which is either '<' or '>'); `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions involving `suffZero`, `preOne`, `ol`, and `zr`; `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

In simpler terms: The string `s1` remains unchanged and consists of characters '<' and '>'. The list `pre` keeps track of the 1-based indices of '>' in `s1`. The variable `totalOne` counts the number of '>' characters in `s1`, with adjustments based on `el`. The list `preOne` is updated based on `pre` and `el`. The list `suffZero` is recalculated based on `el` and other conditions. The list `ans` is a list of zeros with `ans[n-1]` calculated based on the conditions provided. The variable `i` is `n - 3`, and `el` is the character at position `i` in `s1`. The variable `ol` is `totalOne`, and `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', and `1` if `el` is '<'. The values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on conditions involving `suffZero`, `preOne`, `ol`, and `zr`. The value of `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. The variable `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**
