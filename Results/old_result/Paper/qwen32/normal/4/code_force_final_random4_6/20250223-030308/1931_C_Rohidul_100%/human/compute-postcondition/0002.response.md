The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged. The new variable `a` is introduced, which is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input.**
