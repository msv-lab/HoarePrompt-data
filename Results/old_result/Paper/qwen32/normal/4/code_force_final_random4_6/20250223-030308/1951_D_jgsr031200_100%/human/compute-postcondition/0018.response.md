The code snippet `h += curr` increments the value of `h` by the value of `curr`. Given the initial state, `h` is initially set to `curr`, and `curr` is defined as `n // i` where `i` is `n - k + 1`.

After executing `h += curr`, `h` will be `h + curr`, which translates to `curr + curr` or `2 * curr`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `n` is not equal to `k`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`; `costs` is a list `[n - k + 1, 1]`; `h` is `2 * curr`; `curr` is `n // i` where `i` is `n - k + 1`; `i` is `n - k + 1`**.
