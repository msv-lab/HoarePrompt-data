Postcondition: **`t` is the new string input by the user, `n` is the new input integer (must be greater than 0), `s` is the new string input by the user, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`. The count of '1's in `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `t` (i.e., `s1 == t1`).**
