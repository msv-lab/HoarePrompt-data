Postcondition: **`kq1` is '', `kq2` is '', `vt` is 0, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `t` remains unchanged, `q` is `q + 1`, `a` is a sequence with at least one element, `b` is the user input, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`. Additionally, `vt` is 0.**
