Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `k` is not 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0 or `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, `y` is 0 or `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, and `k` retains its non-zero value after all iterations. If `k` is 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `k` is 0.**
