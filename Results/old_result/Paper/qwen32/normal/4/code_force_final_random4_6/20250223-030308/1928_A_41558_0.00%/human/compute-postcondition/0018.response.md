Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then `a` and `b` remain odd. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even. The condition `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a` holds true if it was true before the if-else block, and if it was false before the if-else block, it remains false.**
