Let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
```

This line calculates the value of `extra_screen` based on the value of `extra_space`. The formula used is `extra_space // 15 + 1`, which means `extra_screen` will be the integer division of `extra_space` by 15, plus 1.

Let's break down the variables involved:
- `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.
- `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- `screen_require_for_y` depends on whether `y` is even or odd.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes due to this line of code is `extra_screen`.

Here is the output state in the required format:

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` remains `n - 1`; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `space_x` is equal to `x`; `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`; If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`; `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`; `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`; `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`; If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing the value of `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element, which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, or `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is a multiple of 15; `x` and `y` are updated to the values read from the input.**

In simpler terms, the only change is that `extra_screen` is now calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1`. All other variables retain their previous values or expressions.
