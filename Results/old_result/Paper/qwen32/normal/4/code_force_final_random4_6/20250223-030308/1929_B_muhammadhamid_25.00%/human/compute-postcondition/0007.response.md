To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the variables and the operations involved in the code snippet.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- If `k` is 1, the current value of `k` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.
- `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(math.ceil(k / 2))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `k`**: The value of `k` is read from the input. It is specified that if `k` is 1, it remains 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. This means `k` can be any integer from 1 up to `2*n`.

2. **Operation `k / 2`**: This operation divides `k` by 2. The result of this division can be a whole number or a decimal number depending on whether `k` is even or odd.
   - If `k` is even, `k / 2` will be a whole number.
   - If `k` is odd, `k / 2` will be a decimal number.

3. **`math.ceil(k / 2)`**: The `math.ceil` function rounds the result of `k / 2` up to the nearest integer.
   - If `k` is even, `k / 2` is already a whole number, so `math.ceil(k / 2)` will be `k / 2`.
   - If `k` is odd, `k / 2` is a decimal number, and `math.ceil(k / 2)` will round it up to the next whole number.

### Possible Outputs:
- If `k` is even, the output will be `k / 2`.
- If `k` is odd, the output will be `(k // 2) + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the print statement will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is an integer read from the input and math.ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
