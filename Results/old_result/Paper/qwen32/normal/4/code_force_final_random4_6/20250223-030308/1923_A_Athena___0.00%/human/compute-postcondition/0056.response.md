The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Initially, if the first element of `a` is 0, `res` was 1, and now it becomes 2. If the first element of `a` is not 0, `res` was 0, and now it becomes 1. The values of `a`, `i`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0, otherwise `res` is 1.**
