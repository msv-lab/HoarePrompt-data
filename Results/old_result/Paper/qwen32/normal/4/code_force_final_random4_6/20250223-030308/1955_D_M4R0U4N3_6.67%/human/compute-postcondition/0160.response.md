The code snippet adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Given the initial state, `j` is `m`, so `a[j]` is `a[m]`. Therefore, `extra` will now contain `a[m]` in addition to any elements it already had.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `m` is the second integer provided by the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and is greater than `m`, `k` is the third integer provided by the input, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the latest input, `todo` is a set of unique integers provided by the new input with `a[j]` removed if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged, `done` is a set containing `a[m-1]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` (which is `a[m]`) and any elements it already had, `j` is `m`, `ans` is the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop**.
