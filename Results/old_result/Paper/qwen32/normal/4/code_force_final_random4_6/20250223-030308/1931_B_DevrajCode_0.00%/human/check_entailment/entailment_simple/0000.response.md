### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation.

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The program first calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers `n`. If not, it returns 'No'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant but does no harm.

2. **Target Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.

3. **Simulation of Water Transfer**:
   - The program then iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a `container` variable that tracks the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that the program would need to transfer water from a container that has less water than the target to a previous container, which is not allowed by the problem's constraints (water can only be transferred from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index). In such a case, the program returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it means that it is possible to redistribute the water to meet the target, and the program returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers given the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
