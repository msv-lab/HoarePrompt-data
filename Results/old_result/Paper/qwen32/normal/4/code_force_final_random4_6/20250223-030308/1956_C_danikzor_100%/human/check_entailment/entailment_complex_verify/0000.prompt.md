You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n x n matrix filled with zeroes. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 500. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: - Since `n` is a variable whose value is not explicitly provided, we describe the output in terms of `n`.
    #   - The first value printed is the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers.
    #   - The second value printed is twice the value of `n`.
    #
    #Thus, the output of the `print` statement is described as follows:
    #Output:
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: The loop will output `2n` lines in total. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, there will be two lines printed: the first line starting with `1` and the second line starting with `2`, both followed by `i` and the sequence `n, n-1, ..., 2, 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, prints the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers and twice the value of `n`, and then prints `2n` lines. Each pair of lines consists of a sequence starting with `1` and `2`, followed by the current index `i` and the sequence `n, n-1, ..., 2, 1`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix as per the problem description. Let's analyze the given program and the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to maximize the sum of an n x n matrix using at most 2n operations.
- Operations can be of two types:
  1. Assign a row `i` with a permutation `p` such that `a[i, j] = p[j]`.
  2. Assign a column `i` with a permutation `p` such that `a[j, i] = p[j]`.

### Provided Program:
The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and performs 2n operations by filling each row and each column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the sum is not correct for maximizing the sum of the matrix. The maximum sum should be `n * n * n` because we can fill each cell with the highest possible value in a permutation, which is `n`.
2. **Incorrect Operations**: The operations described in the program do not maximize the sum. By filling each row and column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, the program does not ensure that each cell gets the highest value possible. Instead, it should fill each row and column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` to maximize the sum.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum, we should fill each row and column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This way, each cell will be filled with the value `n`, resulting in a maximum sum of `n * n * n`.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * n * n
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the correctness is `False`.
