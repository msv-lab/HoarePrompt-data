The code appends the integer value of `xylist[0]` to the list `x`. Given that `x` initially contains one element, which is the integer value of `xylist[0]`, after the operation, `x` will contain two identical elements, both being the integer value of `xylist[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input string representing the number of test cases, `x` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing the integer value of `xylist[1]`, `xylist` is a new list of substrings from the input split by spaces, `i` is 4.**
