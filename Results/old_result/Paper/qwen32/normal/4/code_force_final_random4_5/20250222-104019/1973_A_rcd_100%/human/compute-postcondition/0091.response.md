Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 1, 2, or 3; `y` is 0, 1, or `x` (and `y` must be at least `x - 1`).**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decremented by 1, so if `y` was originally 1, it becomes 0; if `y` was 2, it becomes 1; and if `y` was `x + 1`, it becomes `x`. The conditions on `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `x` remain unchanged.
