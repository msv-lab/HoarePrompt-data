Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`n`**: Must be greater than 1 (but its exact value is not specified).
2. **`g`**: Initialized to 0.
3. **`v1`**: Initialized to 0.
4. **`prev`**: The largest `i` for which the user input was `'>'` or `'='` and the subsequent comparison with `prev` resulted in `'<'`. However, the exact value of `prev` is not specified.
5. **`kp`**: Incremented by 1 (`kp = kp + 1`). The initial value of `kp` is not specified, but it is incremented by 1.
6. **`v2`**: Set to `i`. The exact value of `i` is not specified.

### Print Statement Analysis:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Variable Values:
- **`v1`**: Initialized to 0.
- **`v2`**: Set to `i`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can only represent it as `i`.

### Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `v1` and `v2` repeated twice.

Output: **? 0 0 i i (where i is the value of i)**
