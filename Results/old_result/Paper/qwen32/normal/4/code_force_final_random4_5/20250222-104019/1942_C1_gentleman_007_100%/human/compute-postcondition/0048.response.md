Postcondition: **`ver` is a node that has at least two neighbors in the graph, `graph[ver]` is a list containing at least two neighbors, and `node` is the next neighbor in the list after the last one processed. If `vis[node]` was 0, then `q` now includes `node` at the end of its list and `vis[node]` is 1. Otherwise, there is no change to `q` and `vis[node]` remains unchanged.**
