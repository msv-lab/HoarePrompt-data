The code appends an element to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Given that `i` is 2, `i % 2` equals 0. Thus, the element at index 0 of the string 'AB' is appended to `pattern`, which is 'A'. Therefore, `pattern` now contains two additional elements plus 'A', making it a list with three elements where the last element is 'A'.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 to 48, `n` must be at least 5, `pattern` is a list containing three elements where the last element is 'A', `i` is 2**.
