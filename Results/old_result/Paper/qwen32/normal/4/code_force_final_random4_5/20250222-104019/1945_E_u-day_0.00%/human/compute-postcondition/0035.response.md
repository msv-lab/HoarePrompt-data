Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2`, `(n + 1) // 2`, and `mid`, `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`. If `arr[mid] > k`, `low` is updated to `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` and `high` are both updated to `(n + 1) // 2`.**
