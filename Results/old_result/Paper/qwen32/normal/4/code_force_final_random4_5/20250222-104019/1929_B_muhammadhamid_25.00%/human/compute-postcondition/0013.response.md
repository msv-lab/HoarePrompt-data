Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- If `k` is 1, the current value of `k` remains 1. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value.
- The current value of `k` satisfies either `k <= 2 * n` or `k > 2 * n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(1)` statement is a straightforward print statement that outputs the integer `1`. This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

### Output:
The print statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **1**
