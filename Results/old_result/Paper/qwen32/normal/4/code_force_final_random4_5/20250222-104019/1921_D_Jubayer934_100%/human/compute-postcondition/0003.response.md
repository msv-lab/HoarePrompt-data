The code snippet initializes an empty list `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `temp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list.**
