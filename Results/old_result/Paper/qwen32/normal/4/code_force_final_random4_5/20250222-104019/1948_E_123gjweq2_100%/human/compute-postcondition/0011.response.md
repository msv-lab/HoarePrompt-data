The code snippet modifies the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` by assigning it the value of `small_element + i`. 

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number
- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `big_element` is `right + 1`
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + (right - left + 1) // 2`
- `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`
- `i` is `mid - 1`

The value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is updated to `small_element + i`. Since `small_element` is `left + 1` and `i` is `mid - 1`, the new value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + (mid - 1)` which simplifies to `left + mid`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + mid`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is `mid - 1`**
