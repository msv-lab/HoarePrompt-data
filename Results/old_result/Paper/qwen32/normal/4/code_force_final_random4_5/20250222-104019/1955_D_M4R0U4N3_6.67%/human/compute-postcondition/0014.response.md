The code snippet `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element at index `j` from the set `todo`. Given that `j` is initially 1, the element `a[1]` will be removed from `todo`.

Let's break down the possible states:

- If `a[0]` was initially in `todo`, then `todo` initially contained `a[0]` and some other integers, and `done` initially contained `a[0]`. After the removal, `todo` will no longer contain `a[1]`.
- If `a[0]` was not initially in `todo`, then `todo` initially contained some integers excluding `a[0]`, `done` was initially empty, and `extra` initially contained `a[0]`. After the removal, `todo` will no longer contain `a[1]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `j`) remain unchanged unless `j` is modified elsewhere, but in this snippet, `j` is not modified.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 1, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with `a[1]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo` initially, otherwise `done` is an empty set, and `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise `extra` is an empty set.**
