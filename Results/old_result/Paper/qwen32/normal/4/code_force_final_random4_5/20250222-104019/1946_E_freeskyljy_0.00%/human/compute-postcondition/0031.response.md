To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `i > 1` remains true. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to make sure that `i` is greater than 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `N - 3`.

Since `N` is an integer such that `2 < N <= 2 * 10^5`, it follows that `N - 3` is always greater than 1 (because the smallest possible value for `N` is 3, making `N - 3` equal to 0, but since `N` must be greater than 2, `N - 3` is at least -1, and given the context, `N` is at least 4, making `N - 3` at least 1).

However, to ensure that the loop can certainly execute one more time, we need to make sure `i` is explicitly greater than 1. Therefore, we can adjust `i` to be `N - 2` (which is guaranteed to be greater than 1 given the constraints).

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only adjust objects in the loop head.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer such that 2 < `N` <= 2 * 10^5; `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`; `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; `nums_left` is `N - 4`; `i` is `N - 2`.**
