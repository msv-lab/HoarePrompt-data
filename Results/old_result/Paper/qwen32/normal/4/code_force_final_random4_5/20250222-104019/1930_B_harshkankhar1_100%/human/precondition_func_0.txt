The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer \( t \) (1 \(\leq\) \( t \) \(\leq\) 10\(^3\)) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next \( t \) lines contains a single integer \( n \) (3 \(\leq\) \( n \) \(\leq\) 10\(^5\)) representing the length of the permutation \( p \). The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed 10\(^5\).
