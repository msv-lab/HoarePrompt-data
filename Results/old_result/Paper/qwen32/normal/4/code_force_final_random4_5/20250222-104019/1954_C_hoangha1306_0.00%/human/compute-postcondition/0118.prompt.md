Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is the string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is ''; `kq2` is ''; `vt` is 0; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is the new string provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `b`, then `kq1` is the character at index `i` of `a` and `kq2` is the character at index `i` of `a`; otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and if `vt` was originally 0, then `vt` is now 1. If `vt` was 0 and the integer value of `a[i]` is greater than the integer value of `b[i]`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`; otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are non-empty strings provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each appended with the character at index 1 of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is set to 1, and `kq1` is concatenated with `x` while `kq2` is concatenated with `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`; otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with `y` and `kq2` with `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is updated to `kq1` + str(y) and `kq2` is updated to `kq2` + str(x).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are non-empty strings provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 2. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each appended with the character at index 2 of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is set to 1, and `kq1` is concatenated with `x` while `kq2` is concatenated with `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`; otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with `y` and `kq2` with `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is updated to `kq1` + str(y) and `kq2` is updated to `kq2` + str(x).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
