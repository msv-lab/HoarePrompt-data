The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 0, and since the loop is about to start its first iteration, `i` should be 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `i` is 1; `arr[left + mid]` is `right + 1`; `cliquess[left + mid]` is `clique`.**
