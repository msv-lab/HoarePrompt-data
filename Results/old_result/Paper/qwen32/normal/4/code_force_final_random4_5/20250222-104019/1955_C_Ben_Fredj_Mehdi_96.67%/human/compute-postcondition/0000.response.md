Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads an integer `t` from the input. The initial state of `t` is updated to this input value, while the conditions and constraints for the subsequent test cases remain unchanged.
