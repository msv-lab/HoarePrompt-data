The provided code snippet reassigns `arr` to a new list of integers obtained from the input. This means the previous value of `arr` is discarded, and `arr` now holds the new list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from the original `arr` sorted in ascending order.**

In simpler terms, `arr` is updated to a new list of integers from the input, while `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
