Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains the following elements: an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities, an integer `m` (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, and a list of `m` pairs of integers `x_i, y_i` (1 ≤ `x_i, y_i` ≤ `n`; `x_i` ≠ `y_i`) representing the queries. For each city in each test case, the closest city is determined uniquely. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999999999999999
    forward = 999999999999999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` (where `n` is at least 2) cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` as the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` as the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except `prog_cities[i]` which is 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` is `abs(forward - cities[i])`; `i` is 0 or greater than 0. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` is -999999999999999999 and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is `n - 1` or greater, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` remains 999999999999999999`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` is the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` are the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except `prog_cities[i]` which is 1 if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`; otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is `abs(forward - cities[i])`. If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i` is less than `n - 1`, otherwise `forward` is 999999999999999999. If `i` is 0, `back` is -999999999999999999 and `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is `n - 1` or greater, `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` remains 999999999999999999. If `i` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `back` and `forward`. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is now `cities[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities; `m` is the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` are the queries. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` elements where the `i-th` element is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`; otherwise, it is `abs(forward - cities[i])`. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i > 0`, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `back` remains `-99999999999999999999`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
