Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for all possible cases. The logic used in the program is not based on the optimal strategy for the game, which involves the concept of Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program uses a set to find unique pile sizes and then checks if the differences between consecutive sizes are greater than 1. This approach does not consider the optimal strategy for the game, which is based on the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes.

2. **Nim-sum (XOR-sum) Approach**: In this game, the key to determining the winner is to calculate the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is zero, the second player (Bob) wins if both play optimally. If the Nim-sum is non-zero, the first player (Alice) wins.

3. **Counterexample**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   3
   1 2 3
   ```
   The Nim-sum of the pile sizes is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0`. According to the optimal strategy, Bob should win. However, the provided program will incorrectly print "Alice" for this case.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should calculate the Nim-sum of the pile sizes for each test case and determine the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or non-zero.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for num in arr:
            nim_sum ^= num
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly determines the winner by calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
