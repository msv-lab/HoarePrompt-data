The code snippet `prev = 0` sets the value of the variable `prev` to 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `g`, `v1`, and `kp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input by the user, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is unchanged.**
