The code snippet provided assigns a new list of integers obtained from the input to the variable `p`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `t`, `i`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `sm`, `bm`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this particular line of code.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input, `s` is the fourth integer from the input, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n-1, initial_k - 1) + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s] * (i + 1)`, `bp` is `a[b] * (i + 1) - 1`, `sm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated expression for each iteration, `bm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated expression for each iteration, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` remains greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is equal to `sm`.**
