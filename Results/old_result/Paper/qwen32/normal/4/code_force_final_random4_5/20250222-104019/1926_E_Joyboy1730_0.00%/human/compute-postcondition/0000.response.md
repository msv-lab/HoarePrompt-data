The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 5 · 10^4. After executing the code, the value of `t` will be updated to the integer value provided by the input. The constraints on `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
