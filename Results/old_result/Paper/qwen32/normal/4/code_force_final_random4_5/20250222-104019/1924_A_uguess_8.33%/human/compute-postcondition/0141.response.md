The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns a new value to `tmp` based on the current value of `i`. The value of `tmp` becomes the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `ord('a') + i`. The other variables (`cnt`, `cur`, `ans`, `k`, and `n`) are not affected by this operation.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, the new value of `tmp` will be the character corresponding to this new value of `i`.

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times a subset of `k` distinct characters has been encountered in `s`; `cur` is the bitmask of the last set of characters processed before the loop ends; if the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, then `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)`; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string of length `cnt` consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + i)`**.
