The code snippet assigns the value of `y[i] - y[j]` to the variable `dy`. The values of `i`, `j`, `y`, and `n` are given in the initial state. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length n, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length n, `nodes` is a list that includes `i`, `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length n, `n` must be greater than 0, `dx` is x[i] - x[j], `dy` is y[i] - y[j]**.
