The code snippet `count[num] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `count` by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `num`, `res`, and the other elements in `count` remain unchanged except for the value associated with `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `res` is 1 or 0 depending on the previous iteration, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**
