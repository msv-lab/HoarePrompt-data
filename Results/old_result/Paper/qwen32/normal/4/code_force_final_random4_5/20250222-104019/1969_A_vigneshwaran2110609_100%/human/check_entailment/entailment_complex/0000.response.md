Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program's logic is flawed and does not accurately determine the minimum number of invitations required to ensure that at least two friends come to the party.

The program checks if there exists an index `i` such that `p_i` equals `i + 1`. However, this condition does not guarantee that sending invitations to these two friends will result in at least two friends attending the party. The problem condition is that both the `i`-th friend and the `p_i`-th friend must receive invitations for either of them to attend.

Moreover, the program incorrectly assumes that if no such `i` is found, the answer is always `3`. This is not true because there could be other valid configurations where sending fewer than three invitations can still result in at least two friends attending.

For example, consider the test case:
```
2
4
2 3 4 1
4
3 4 1 2
```
For the first test case, the program will print `3` because there is no `i` such that `p_i == i + 1`. However, the correct answer is `2` because sending invitations to friends 1 and 2 will ensure that both 1 and 2 attend the party (since 1's best friend is 2 and 2's best friend is 3, and 3's best friend is 4, and 4's best friend is 1).

Similarly, for the second test case, the program will print `3` again, but the correct answer is also `2` because sending invitations to friends 1 and 3 will ensure that both 1 and 3 attend the party.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
