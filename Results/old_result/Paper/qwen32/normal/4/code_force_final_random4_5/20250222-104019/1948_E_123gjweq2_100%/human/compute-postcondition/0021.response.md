The code snippet `arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i` modifies the value of `arr` at the index `left + mid + i`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `big_element` is `right + 1`
- `i` is `2`
- `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`

Therefore, the index `left + mid + i` becomes `left + (right - left + 1) // 2 + 2`.

The value assigned to `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i`, which is `right + 1 - 2` or `right - 1`.

Other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `i` is 2; `arr[left + mid]` is `right + 1`; `cliquess[left + mid]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 1]` is `right`; `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 2]` is `right - 1`.**
