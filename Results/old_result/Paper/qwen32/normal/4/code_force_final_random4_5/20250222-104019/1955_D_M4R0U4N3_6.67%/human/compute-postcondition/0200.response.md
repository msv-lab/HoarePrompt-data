The code snippet provided is simply `ans += 1`, which increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables (`r`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, `todo`, `a`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` has `old` removed from it. Otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, `done` does not contain the value of `old` and `todo` contains the value of `old`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. `ans` is incremented by 1.**
