Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` has one less node, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start`, `current` is the node that was at the front of `queue`, `dist` is the distance associated with the `current` node if it was part of a tuple, otherwise it is the node itself. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`, which is the shortest distance from `start` to `target`. Otherwise, `dist` will be the distance to the last node processed.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` has one less node. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` has one more node which is `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `neighbor`. Otherwise, `queue` has one less node and `visited` remains unchanged. `current` is a key in `tree` and `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `dist` is the distance associated with the `current` node if it was part of a tuple, otherwise it is the node itself.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` has one less node. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` has one more node which is `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` includes `neighbor`. Otherwise, `queue` has one less node and `visited` remains unchanged. `current` is a key in `tree` and `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `dist` is the distance associated with the `current` node if it was part of a tuple, otherwise it is the node itself, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` has one less node initially and one more node if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `visited` includes `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not already in `visited`, `current` is a key in `tree` and `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `dist` is the distance associated with the `current` node if it was part of a tuple, otherwise it is the node itself, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
