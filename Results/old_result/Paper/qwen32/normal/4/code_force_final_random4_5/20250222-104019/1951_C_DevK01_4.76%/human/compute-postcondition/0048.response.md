The provided code snippet reassigns the value of `cost` using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula is specifically used when `n * m == k`. Since the code snippet does not change any other variables, only `cost` is updated based on the given formula. 

Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t`; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in ascending order; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]`; `w` is the last element of the original `N` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.

In natural language, the output state remains the same except that the variable `cost` is now calculated using the formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
