Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State:
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `t` is greater than `i + 1`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(2)` statement in the code snippet will output the integer `2` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `t`, and `i`. The print statement is hardcoded to output the number `2`.

### Output:
Output: **2**
