The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr` to be iterated over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element processed in the list `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `arr` to be processed. This means `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

Since `arr` has at least 2 elements and we have just processed one, there must be at least one more element left to process. Therefore, `num` should be the next element in `arr` after the previously processed one.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 2 elements; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key, and `frequency_table[num]` is `k` if it was originally greater than `k`; otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in the list `arr`.** 

Since `num` was the last processed element, the next state should reflect that `num` is now the subsequent element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 2 elements; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key, and `frequency_table[num]` is `k` if it was originally greater than `k`; otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in the list `arr` after the previously processed one.**

To be more specific, if `num` was the i-th element, it should now be the (i+1)-th element:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 2 elements; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key, and `frequency_table[num]` is `k` if it was originally greater than `k`; otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in the list `arr`.** 

Since we don't have the exact index, we can generalize:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 2 elements; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key, and `frequency_table[num]` is `k` if it was originally greater than `k`; otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in the list `arr` to be processed.**
