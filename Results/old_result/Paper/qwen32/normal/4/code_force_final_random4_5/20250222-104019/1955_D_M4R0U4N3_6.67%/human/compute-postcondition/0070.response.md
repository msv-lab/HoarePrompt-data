To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop evolves over time and how the variables `done`, `todo`, `extra`, and `ans` change.

### Loop Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `m` is the second integer from the input.
   - `k` is the third integer from the input.
   - `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with all elements that were in `a` and `todo` removed.
   - `done` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were initially in `todo`.
   - `extra` is a set containing all elements from `a` that were not in `todo`.
   - `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `r = m` to `r = n-1`.
   - For each iteration:
     - `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.
     - If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`.
     - If `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`.
     - If `a[r]` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
     - If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
     - If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop completes, `r` will have iterated from `m` to `n-1`, meaning `r` will have taken on every value in this range.
- The sets `done`, `todo`, and `extra` will have been updated according to the rules specified in the loop.
- `ans` will reflect the number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.

### Output State in Natural Language:
The final output state will be:
- `done` will contain elements that were in `todo` at the start and have been moved to `done` during the loop, minus any that were moved back to `todo`.
- `todo` will contain elements that were initially in `todo` and have been moved back from `done` during the loop, plus any elements that were moved from `extra` to `todo`.
- `extra` will contain elements that were not in `todo` at the start and have not been moved to `done` during the loop, minus any that were moved to `todo`.
- `ans` will be the count of times the number of elements in `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop.

### Final Output State in Specified Format:
Output State: **`done` contains elements moved from `todo` and back, `todo` contains elements moved from `done` and `extra`, `extra` contains elements not in `todo` and not moved to `done`, `ans` is the count of times `len(done) >= k`.**
