Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is set to 0. All other variables, including `a`, `input`, and `data`, remain unchanged.
