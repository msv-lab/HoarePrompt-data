Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.
   - `x` is not equal to `-1`, meaning there is at least one character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet simply prints `'YES'`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `s`, `n`, `x`, and the results of `func_1` calls do not affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The `print` statement is straightforward and will always output `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the results of the function calls.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
