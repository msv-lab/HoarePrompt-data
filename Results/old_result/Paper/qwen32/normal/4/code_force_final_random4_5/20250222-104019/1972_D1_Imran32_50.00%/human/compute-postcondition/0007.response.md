The value of `cnt` is updated to be `i * i`. Given that `i` is 3, `cnt` becomes `3 * 3`, which is 9. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` is an integer, `ans` is `n + (n + 3) // 9`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, `cnt` is 9, `i` is 3**
