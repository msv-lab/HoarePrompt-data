### Reasoning

The provided program follows the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary accurately. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Handling the Case When \( a \geq b \)**:
   - If the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the modified price \( b \), the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). The program correctly computes the profit as \( n \times a \).
   - **Example**: For input `4 4 5`, since \( a = 4 \) and \( b = 5 \), the program correctly computes the profit as \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) if \( a \geq b \) were true, but since \( a < b \) here, it correctly computes the profit as \( 17 \) by selling one bun at \( 5 \) and the rest at \( 4 \).

2. **Handling the Case When \( a < b \)**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of buns \( k \) that can be sold at the modified price, which is \( \min(b - a + 1, n) \).
   - It then calculates the profit from selling the first \( k \) buns using the sum of an arithmetic series formula: \( \text{ans} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2} \).
   - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is calculated as \( (n - k) \times a \).
   - Finally, it sums these two profits and prints the result.
   - **Example**: For input `5 5 9`, since \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 9 \), the program correctly computes the profit as \( 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35 \).

3. **Verification with Provided Examples**:
   - All the provided examples and edge cases are correctly handled by the program.
   - The program produces the expected output for each test case.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion rules. It handles both scenarios (\( a \geq b \) and \( a < b \)) appropriately and computes the correct profit for each test case.

**Final: True**
