The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Here, `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`, and `i` is a variable whose value is not specified in the initial state but is provided at the time of the operation.

Given that `ops` was initially an empty list, after the operation, `ops` will contain the tuple `(c, i)`. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` inclusive, where the last vertex in the list is `a` and `previous[a]` is `-1`; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)`; the length of `path_ba` is odd and at least 3; `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2; `c` is the vertex at the middle index of `path_ba`**.
