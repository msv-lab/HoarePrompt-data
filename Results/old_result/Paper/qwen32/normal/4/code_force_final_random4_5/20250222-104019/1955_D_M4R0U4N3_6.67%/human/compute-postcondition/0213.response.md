Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done` or `todo`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `extra` contains `a[r]` and any other elements it had previously. `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been increased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain as described in the initial state.
