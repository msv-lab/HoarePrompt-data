The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` is 1, so after the increment, `l` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` must be at least 2, `end` is 1, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions given, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]` and `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`, `le` is the length of `a`, `l` is 2, `st` is 2.**
