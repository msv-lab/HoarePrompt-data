The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `v1` (the largest integer from 1 to `n-1` for which the user's response was `'<'`). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain the same, as it is the upper bound of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `r` remains unchanged, `prev` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is `v1 + 1`**
