The value of `num` is incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is 2, `m` is `n - 2`, `i` is 0, `c` is the first integer from the input, `r` is the second integer from the input, and `c` is not equal to `r`**.
