In the provided for loop, the loop variable is `_` and the range is determined by the integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided as input. The variables `n` and `a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n` are not part of the loop head and are read inside the loop body, so we cannot adjust their states before the loop starts. 

The only variable we can adjust based on the loop head is `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
