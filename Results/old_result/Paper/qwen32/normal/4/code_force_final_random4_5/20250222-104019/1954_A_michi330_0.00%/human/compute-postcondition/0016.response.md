The provided Python code snippet contains a `print('Yes')` statement. This statement will execute and print "Yes" regardless of the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` because the `print` statement is not dependent on the evaluation of the condition. The condition seems to be part of a larger program or function that might influence other parts of the code, but it does not affect this specific `print` statement.

Given that the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions that could change its output, the output will simply be "Yes".

Output: **Yes**
