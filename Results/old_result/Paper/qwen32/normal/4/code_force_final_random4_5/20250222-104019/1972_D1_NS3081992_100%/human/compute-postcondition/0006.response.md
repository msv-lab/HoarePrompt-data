To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of `func_10()` and `func_15()`. 

From the given information:
- `func_10()` determines the number of times the loop will execute.
- `func_15()` returns the value that is printed in each iteration.

The loop will execute `func_10()` times, and in each iteration, `func_15()` is called and its result is printed.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop will execute `func_10()` times.
- In each iteration, `func_15()` is called and prints its result.

Since the loop will execute `func_10()` times, the final output state will be that the loop has executed exactly `func_10()` times, and in each of those executions, `func_15()` has been called and its result has been printed.

Therefore, the output state after all executions of the loop will be:

Output State: **The loop has executed `func_10()` times, and in each of those executions, `func_15()` has been called and its result has been printed.**
