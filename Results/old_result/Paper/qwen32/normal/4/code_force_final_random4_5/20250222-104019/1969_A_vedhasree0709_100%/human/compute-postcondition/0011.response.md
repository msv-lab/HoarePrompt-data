Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is the first element of `l`; `q` is 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it causes an exit from the most internal loop or if statement.
