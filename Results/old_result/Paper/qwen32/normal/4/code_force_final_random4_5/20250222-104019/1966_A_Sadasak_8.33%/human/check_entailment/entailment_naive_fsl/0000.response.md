Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the operations as described in the problem statement.

Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Handling of Frequencies**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly truncates the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is not the correct approach. Instead, we should keep the actual frequency and then apply the operation to reduce the count of cards.

2. **Logic for Reducing Cards**: The logic for reducing the number of cards based on the frequency is incorrect. The code does not properly account for the operations that can be performed to reduce the number of cards. Specifically, for each card number with a frequency `freq`, the number of cards that can be left after performing the operations is `freq % (k-1)`. If `freq % (k-1)` is zero, it means we can reduce the number of cards to `k-1` (except when `freq` is exactly `k`, in which case we can reduce to `k-1` as well).

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle some edge cases correctly. For example, if all card numbers have frequencies that are multiples of `k`, the code does not correctly reduce the number of cards to the minimum possible.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
6 3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- We have 6 cards with the number 1.
- We can perform the operation twice: 
  - First, choose 3 cards and replace them with 2 cards. Now we have 5 cards.
  - Second, choose 3 cards and replace them with 2 cards. Now we have 4 cards.
- We can perform the operation one more time:
  - Choose 3 cards and replace them with 2 cards. Now we have 3 cards.
- Finally, we can perform the operation one last time:
  - Choose 3 cards and replace them with 2 cards. Now we have 2 cards.

**Actual Output of Provided Code:**
```
1
```

The provided code incorrectly outputs `1` for this test case, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
