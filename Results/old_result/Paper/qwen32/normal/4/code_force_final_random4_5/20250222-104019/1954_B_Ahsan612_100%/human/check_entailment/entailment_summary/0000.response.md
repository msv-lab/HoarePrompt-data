Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. The program does this by identifying the smallest sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the array. If all elements in the array are the same, or if there is no sequence of identical consecutive numbers (which is not possible given the problem constraints), the program correctly outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the smallest sequence of consecutive identical numbers, as removing any element from such a sequence would disrupt the condition that makes the array beautiful.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation. The loop logic for finding the minimum length of consecutive identical numbers is flawed. The loop increments `i` twice in some cases, which can cause it to skip over elements. Specifically, the line `i += 1` is executed twice in the loop, which means the loop effectively skips every other element after the first mismatch is found. This can lead to incorrect results for certain input arrays.

To fix this, the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `i` is incremented correctly after each iteration. Here is a corrected version of the loop:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
                num = ar[i]
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

Given the original implementation, the correctness is **False** because of the flawed logic in the loop.

Correctness: **False**
