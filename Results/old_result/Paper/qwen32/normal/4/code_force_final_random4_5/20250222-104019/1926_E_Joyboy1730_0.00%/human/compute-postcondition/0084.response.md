Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is a non-zero integer and `n` has been decreased by `(n + 1) // 2`; `k` is the value provided by the input; `L` is []; `pow` is 1; `tot` is 0; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `n` has been updated by subtracting `(n + 1) // 2` from it. All other variables retain their initial states.
