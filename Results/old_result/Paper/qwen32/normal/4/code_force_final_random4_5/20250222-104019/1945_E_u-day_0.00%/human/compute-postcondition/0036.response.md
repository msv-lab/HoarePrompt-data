To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it evolves with each iteration. The loop is a binary search variant that continues until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the loop progresses and eventually terminates:

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is the first value returned by `func_1()`.
- `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is an empty set.

### Loop Behavior:
The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`. In each iteration:
- `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- `st` adds the current `mid`.
- If `arr[mid] > k`, `high` is updated to `mid`.
- Otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.

### Analysis of the Given States:
1. **After 1 iteration**:
   - `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.
   - `st` contains `{(n - 1) // 2}`.
   - Depending on `arr[mid] > k`, either `high` or `low` is updated.

2. **After 2 iterations**:
   - `mid` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - `st` contains `{(n - 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2}`.
   - Depending on `arr[mid] > k`, either `high` or `low` is updated.

3. **After 3 iterations**:
   - `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `st` contains `{(n - 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2, mid}`.
   - Depending on `arr[mid] > k`, either `high` or `low` is updated.

### Loop Termination:
The loop terminates when `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. At this point, `low` and `high` are adjacent indices, and `mid` will not change in subsequent iterations.

### Final State:
- `low` and `high` will be adjacent indices.
- `st` will contain all the `mid` values calculated during the iterations.
- `mid` will be the last calculated mid-point before termination.
- `arr[mid]` will help determine the final `low` and `high`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will have `low` and `high` as adjacent indices, and `st` will include all `mid` values calculated throughout the loop. The exact values of `low` and `high` will depend on the values in `arr` and `k`.

Output State: **`low` and `high` are adjacent indices, `st` contains all `mid` values calculated during the iterations.**

In simpler terms, the loop will stop when `low` and `high` are next to each other, and the set `st` will have all the midpoints that were checked during the search.
