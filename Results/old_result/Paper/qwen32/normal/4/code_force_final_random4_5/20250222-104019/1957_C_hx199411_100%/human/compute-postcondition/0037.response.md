The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, and `dp[i]` updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is 5, `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`**
