Postcondition: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-i]`, and `s2` is updated to `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`. If `negatives + i` is greater than the length of `elements`, no changes are made to `i`, `s`, or `s2`.**
