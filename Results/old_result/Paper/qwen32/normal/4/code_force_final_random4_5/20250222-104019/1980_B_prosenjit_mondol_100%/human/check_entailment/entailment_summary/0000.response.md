### Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube could be removed, not removed, or might be either removed or left based on the sorting and selection process described in the problem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cubes), `f` (index of the favorite cube), and `k` (number of cubes to remove).
   - It then reads the list `a` of `n` integers representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Adjust Indices:**
   - `f` and `k` are decremented by 1 to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is standard in Python.

3. **Store Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The value of the favorite cube `x` is stored before sorting.

4. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - The program compares the value of the favorite cube `x` with the value of the `k`-th element in the sorted list:
     - If `a[k] > x`, it means the favorite cube is definitely not among the first `k` cubes, so it will not be removed (`print('NO')`).
     - If `a[k] < x`, it means the favorite cube is definitely among the first `k` cubes, so it will be removed (`print('YES')`).
     - If `a[k] == x`, the program checks if there are more cubes with the same value as `x` that could be removed. If `k` is the last index or the next element `a[k + 1]` is less than `x`, it means the favorite cube might be among the first `k` cubes (`print('MAYBE')`). Otherwise, it will definitely be removed (`print('YES')`).

### Conclusion:
The program accurately reflects the problem's requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
