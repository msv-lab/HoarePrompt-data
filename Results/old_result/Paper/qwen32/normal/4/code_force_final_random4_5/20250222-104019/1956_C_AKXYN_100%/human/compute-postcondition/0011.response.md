To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: A positive integer between 1 and 500. However, `t` is not directly used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
2. **`n`**: An input integer. This value is used in the matrix `mat` and the calculation of `res`.
3. **`mat`**: A matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`. This matrix is not used in the print statement.
4. **`res`**: The sum of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

### Calculation of `res`:
The expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is summed for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Let's break down the expression for clarity:
- For `i = 0`, the expression evaluates to `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`.
- For `i = 1`, the expression evaluates to `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`.
- For `i = 2`, the expression evaluates to `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15`.
- And so on...

The sum of these values for `i` from 0 to `n-1` is stored in `res`.

### Bitwise Left Shift `n << 1`:
The expression `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which is equivalent to multiplying `n` by 2. Therefore, `n << 1` is simply `2 * n`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(res, n << 1)
```

### Output Description:
- **`res`**: The sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- **`n << 1`**: This is equivalent to `2 * n`.

Given the above, the output will be the value of `res` followed by `2 * n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **res (where res is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1), 2 * n**
