Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order and returns the result of a comparison among their scores. If `p_1` is equal to `p_2` and `p_2` is equal to `p_3`, it returns "draw". If `p_3` is greater than `p_2` and `p_2` is greater than `p_1`, it returns "no draw".**
