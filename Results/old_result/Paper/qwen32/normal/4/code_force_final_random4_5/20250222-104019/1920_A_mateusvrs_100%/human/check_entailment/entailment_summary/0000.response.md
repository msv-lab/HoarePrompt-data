Reasoning:
The program correctly processes each test case by reading the constraints and determining the valid range for `k` based on the constraints of type 1 and 2. It then calculates the number of integers `k` within this range that do not violate any constraints of type 3.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `ax` to a large number (1000000000 + 7) and `bx` to -1. `ax` will store the minimum value `k` can take (from constraints of type 2), and `bx` will store the maximum value `k` can take (from constraints of type 1). `cx` is a set that stores the values `k` cannot take (from constraints of type 3).

2. **Processing Constraints**: For each constraint, the program updates `ax`, `bx`, or adds the value to `cx` based on the type of the constraint.

3. **Checking Validity**: After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` (maximum allowable value) is greater than `ax` (minimum allowable value). If so, it means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy all constraints, and the result is 0.

4. **Counting Valid `k` Values**: If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, the program calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in `cx`. This is done by subtracting the count of values in `cx` that fall within the range from the total number of integers in the range.

5. **Output**: The program appends the result for each test case to a list and prints the results at the end.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
