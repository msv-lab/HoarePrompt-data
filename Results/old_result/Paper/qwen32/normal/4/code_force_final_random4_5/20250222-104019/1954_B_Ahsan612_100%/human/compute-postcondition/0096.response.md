The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is initially either 1 or 2, after the increment, `i` will be either 2 or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is either 2 or 3, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`, `same` is 2 if `ar[i-1]` equals `num` (i.e., `ar[1]` equals `ar[0]` or `ar[2]` equals `ar[0]` if `i` was 2 and `ar[2]` equals `ar[1]` if `i` was 1), otherwise `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf` if `same` is 2, otherwise `minn` is 1.**
