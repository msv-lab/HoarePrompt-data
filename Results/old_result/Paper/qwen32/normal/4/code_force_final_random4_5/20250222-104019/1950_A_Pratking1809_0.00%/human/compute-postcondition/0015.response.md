Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `mn` is 100. If `a < b < c`, the condition is satisfied as per the if part; otherwise, no changes are made to the variables as there is no else part.**
