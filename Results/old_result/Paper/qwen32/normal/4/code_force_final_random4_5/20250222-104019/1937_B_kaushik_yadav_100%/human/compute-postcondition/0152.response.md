The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` is now an empty string, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string**.
