The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns the first to `a` and the second to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `cx` is an empty set; `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is -1; `a` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input.**
