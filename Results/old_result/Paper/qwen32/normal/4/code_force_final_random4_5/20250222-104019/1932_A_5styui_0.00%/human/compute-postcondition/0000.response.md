Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and the path is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'; `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of an integer input, while the other variables `t`, `n`, and `path` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.
