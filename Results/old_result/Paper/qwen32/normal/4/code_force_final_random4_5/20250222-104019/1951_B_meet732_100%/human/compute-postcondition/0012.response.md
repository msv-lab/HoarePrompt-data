Output State: **`a` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `x` is the value of `a[k]` for the current test case. `ind` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains empty, and now `ind` also includes the value `i`. If `c` is 2, then the program executes the if part; otherwise, it does nothing. `i` is `j + 1`.**

In simpler terms: The list `ind` now includes the value `i` in addition to any values it previously contained. All other variables remain unchanged.
