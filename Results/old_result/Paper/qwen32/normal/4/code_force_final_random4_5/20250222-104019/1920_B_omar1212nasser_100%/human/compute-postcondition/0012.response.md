The value of `s` is decremented by the value of `elements[-i]`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, and the fact that `i` is incremented by 1 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is `s - elements[-i]`.**
