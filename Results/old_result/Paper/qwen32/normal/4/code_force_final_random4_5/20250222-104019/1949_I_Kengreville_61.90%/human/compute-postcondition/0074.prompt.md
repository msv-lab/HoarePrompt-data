Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n`; `nodes` is an empty list; `i` is n-1; `ok` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with length `n` except possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if `visited[0]` was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if `visited[0]` was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with length `n` except possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if `visited[0]` was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list that is either empty or contains `[0]` if `visited[0]` was initially `False`; `i` is 0; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False`, in which case `ok` is `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` set to `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `None` values with `coef0[1]` and `coef1[1]` possibly updated if `visited[1]` was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which may have elements added to it; `i` is 1; `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not equal to `0`, otherwise `False`; `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`. If `visited[1]` was initially `False`, `visited[1]` is now `True`, and `coef0[1]` and `coef1[1]` may have been updated, and `ok` is determined based on the value of `c1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `ok`, `c0`, or `c1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element is the first, second, and third integer from the i-th input, respectively; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` set to `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of `None` values with `coef0[1]` and `coef1[1]` possibly updated if `visited[1]` was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which may have elements added to it; `i` is 2; `c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`; `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`. If `visited[i]` was `False`, `visited[i]` is now `True`, and `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]` may have been updated, and `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not equal to `0`. If `visited[i]` was `True`, no changes are made to `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `ok`, `c0`, or `c1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
