Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 4 elements, if `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is now 2, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is now 3, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
