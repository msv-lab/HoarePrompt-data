The value of `i` is assigned the value of `R[0] + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -1; `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is 1; `i` is `R[0] + 1`.
