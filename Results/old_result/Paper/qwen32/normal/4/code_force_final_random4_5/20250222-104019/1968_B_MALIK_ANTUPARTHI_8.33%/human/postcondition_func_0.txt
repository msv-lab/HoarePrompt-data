The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then prints an integer `k` for each test case, which is determined based on the relationship between the two binary strings.
