Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `ans` remain as they were, but the loop or if statement is exited.
