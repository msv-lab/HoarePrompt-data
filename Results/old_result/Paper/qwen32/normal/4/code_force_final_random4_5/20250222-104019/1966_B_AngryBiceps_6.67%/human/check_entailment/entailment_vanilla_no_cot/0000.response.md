To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and compare it to the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operation. The operation allows us to select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them that color.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Color Rows or Columns**: If there is at least one row or one column that is entirely of one color (either all 'W' or all 'B'), it is possible to make the entire grid that color by repeatedly applying the operation to that row or column and any other row or column.
2. **Contradictory Rows or Columns**: If there is a row that is entirely of one color and a row that is entirely of the opposite color, and these rows are not the same, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps:
1. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`).
2. It reads the grid row by row.
3. It constructs two strings: `first_row` (which contains the first character of each row) and `last_row` (which contains the last character of each row).
4. It checks two conditions:
   - If the first row is entirely of one color (`len(set(a[0])) == 1`) and the first row is different from the last row (`a[0] != a[-1]`), it prints "NO".
   - If the first column (constructed by `first_row`) is entirely of one color (`len(set(first_row)) == 1`) and the first column is different from the last column (`first_row != last_row`), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues with the Program:
The program only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns. This is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to make the entire grid the same color. For example, consider a grid where the first row is all 'W', the last row is all 'B', but there are other rows that are all 'W'. The program would incorrectly print "NO" in this case.

### Correctness:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible configurations of the grid. It only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is not a comprehensive check for the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
