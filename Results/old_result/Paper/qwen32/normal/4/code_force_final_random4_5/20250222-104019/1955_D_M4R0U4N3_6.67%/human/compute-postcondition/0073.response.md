The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial states of `done`, `todo`, `extra`, and `ans` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`done` contains elements moved from `todo` and back, `todo` contains elements moved from `done` and `extra`, `extra` contains elements not in `todo` and not moved to `done`, `ans` is the count of times `len(done) >= k`, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer.**

In simple terms, the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are now assigned the values of the three integers read from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.
