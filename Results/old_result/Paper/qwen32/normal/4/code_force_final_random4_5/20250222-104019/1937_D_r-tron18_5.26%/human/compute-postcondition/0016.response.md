To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the line `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Given:
- `oneInd` is initially `preOne[1]`.
- `func_1(preOne, 1)` is a function call that presumably returns some value based on the input list `preOne` and the integer `1`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we can only assume that `func_1(preOne, 1)` returns a specific value, which we'll denote as `x`.

Thus, `oneInd` will be updated to `preOne[1] - x`.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0`; `ol` is greater than `zr`; `zeroInd` is `0`; `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - x`.**
