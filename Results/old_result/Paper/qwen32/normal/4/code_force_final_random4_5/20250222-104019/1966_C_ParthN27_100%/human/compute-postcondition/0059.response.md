The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables.

The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1):` will execute if `n - 1` is greater than `1`, which means `n` must be greater than `2`. Given that `n` is the length of the list `s` and `n` is not equal to `2`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `3` for the loop to execute.

The initial state provided includes that `n` is not equal to `2`, but we need to explicitly state that `n` must be greater than `2` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least `3`. The other variables `t`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s` and `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element, `ans` is 1**
