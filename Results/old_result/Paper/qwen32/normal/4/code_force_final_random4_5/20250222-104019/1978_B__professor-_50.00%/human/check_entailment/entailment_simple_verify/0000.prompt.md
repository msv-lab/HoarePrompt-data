You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Bob sells buns with a promotion where he can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price of `(b - i + 1)` coins, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price of `a` coins. The goal is to maximize the profit.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the maximum profit based on the conditions:
1. If `b <= a`, sell all buns at the usual price.
2. If `b - a >= n`, sell all buns at the modified price.
3. Otherwise, calculate the profit by selling the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price.

### Code Review:
Let's break down the logic of the code:
- **Case 1:** If `b <= a`, the program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a`.
- **Case 2:** If `b - a >= n`, the program calculates the profit as the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which is correct.
- **Case 3:** The logic here seems incorrect. The formula `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for the scenario where `b - a < n`. The correct approach would be to sum the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series from `b` down to `b - (b - a) + 1` and then add the profit from the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

### Correct Approach:
For the third case, the correct formula should be:
\[ \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=0}^{b-a-1} (b - i) + (n - (b - a)) * a \]
This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(b + (b - (b - a) + 1)) \cdot (b - a)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \cdot a \]
\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{(2b - a + 1) \cdot (b - a)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \cdot a \]

### Testing the Provided Code:
Let's test the provided code with the example inputs and see if it produces the correct results.

### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input:** `4 4 5`
   - **Expected Output:** `17`
   - **Actual Output:** `17` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `5 5 9`
   - **Expected Output:** `35`
   - **Actual Output:** `35` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `10 10 5`
   - **Expected Output:** `100`
   - **Actual Output:** `100` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `5 5 11`
   - **Expected Output:** `45`
   - **Actual Output:** `15` (Incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not handle the third case correctly. Specifically, for the input `5 5 11`, the expected output is `45`, but the code outputs `15`. This indicates that the logic for the third case is flawed.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for the case where `b - a < n`. The formula used in the code for this case is incorrect, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
