The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three sorted scores (p_1, p_2, p_3). For each test case, it determines and prints a value based on the scores. If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a specific value that depends on the relationships between the scores, aiming to find a balanced sum involving the scores.
