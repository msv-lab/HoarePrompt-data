To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the given loop and the conditions under which it terminates. The loop increments `j` until either `j` is no longer less than `m` or `b[j]` equals `a[i]`.

From the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop continues to increment `j` as long as `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`. Therefore, the loop will terminate either when `j` reaches `m` or when it finds an index `j` such that `b[j] == a[i]`.

Given the conditions:
- After 1 iteration: `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `b[0]` is not equal to `a[i]`
- After 2 iterations: `j` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `b[1]` is not equal to `a[i]`
- After 3 iterations: `j` is 3, `m` is greater than 2, `b[2]` is not equal to `a[i]`

The loop will continue to increment `j` until one of the termination conditions is met. If `b[j]` never equals `a[i]` for any `j` less than `m`, the loop will terminate when `j` reaches `m`.

Thus, the final output state of the loop will be:
- `j` will be equal to `m` if no `b[j]` equals `a[i]` for any `j` less than `m`.
- `i` will remain incremented by 1 from its initial state, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `m`.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will have been incremented by 1, and `j` will have reached the value of `m`, indicating that the loop has checked all elements in `b` up to the `m`-th element without finding a match with `a[i]`.
