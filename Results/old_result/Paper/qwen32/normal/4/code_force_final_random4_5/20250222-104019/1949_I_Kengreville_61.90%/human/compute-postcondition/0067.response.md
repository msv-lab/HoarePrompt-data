The value of `c1` is incremented by `coef1[j]`. The other variables, `j` and `c0`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is the next element in `nodes`; `c0` is `c0` plus `coef0[j]`; `c1` is `c1` plus `coef1[j]`.

Output State: **`j` is the next element in `nodes`; `c0` is `c0` plus `coef0[j]`; `c1` is `c1` plus `coef1[j]`.**
