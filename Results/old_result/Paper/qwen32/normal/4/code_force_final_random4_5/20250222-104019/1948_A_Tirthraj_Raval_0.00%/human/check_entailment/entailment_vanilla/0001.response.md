Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding
We need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Conditions and Constraints
- The number of test cases, `t`, is between 1 and 50.
- The number of special characters, `n`, is between 1 and 50.
- If no suitable string can be constructed, the output should be "NO".
- If a suitable string can be constructed, the output should be "YES" followed by the string itself.

### Analysis of the Code
The given code handles the problem as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. It checks if `n` is odd:
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in the described pattern.
   - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct a string:
     - It initializes an empty list `pattern`.
     - It appends pairs of characters 'A' and 'B' alternately to the list `pattern` for `n // 2` times.
     - It then joins the list into a string and prints it.

### Verification
To verify the correctness of the code, let's consider the examples provided:
1. **Example 1 (n = 6):**
   - The pattern generated is "ABABAB".
   - Special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 (considering 1-based indexing).
   - This matches the problem's requirement, and the output is correct.

2. **Example 2 (n = 1):**
   - Since `n` is odd, the output is "NO", which is correct.

3. **Example 3 (n = 2):**
   - The pattern generated is "AB".
   - Special characters are at positions 1 and 2.
   - This matches the problem's requirement, and the output is correct.

### Conclusion
The code correctly handles both the cases where `n` is even and odd. It generates a suitable string when `n` is even and correctly identifies that no suitable string exists when `n` is odd.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
