The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `first_row`. Given the initial state, `first_row` is the first character of the first string in `a`, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of the second string in `a`. Therefore, `first_row` will now be the concatenation of its original value and the first character of the second string in `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements: the original input string and the new input string, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the first string in `a` and the first character of the second string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is 1.**
