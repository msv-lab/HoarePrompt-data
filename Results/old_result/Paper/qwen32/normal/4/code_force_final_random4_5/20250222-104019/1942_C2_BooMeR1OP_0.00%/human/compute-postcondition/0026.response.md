Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is an empty list, `x` must be greater than 0, `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**

In this output state, the value of `gap` is calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
