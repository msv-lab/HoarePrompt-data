You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives multiple test cases. Each test case is a tuple of two integers (n, k) where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of islands and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2) represents the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the program has printed either `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, or `n - 1` if `k` is less than `n - 1`. The variable `i` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that all iterations are completed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description to determine its correctness.

The task is to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The logic in the program considers the following:

1. If \( k \geq n - 1 \), print 1 (Everule can only visit island 1).
2. Otherwise, print \( n - 1 \) (Everule can visit \( n - 1 \) islands).

This logic seems to be based on the idea that if Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands, then Everule can only visit island 1. Otherwise, Everule can still visit all islands except for one.

However, this logic is not entirely correct. Let's consider the following cases:

- If \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the program will print 2. However, Dominater can destroy the bridge between island 1 and island 2, and Everule can still visit island 3 via island 2. Thus, Everule can visit 3 islands, not 2.
- If \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), the program will print 3. However, Dominater can destroy the bridges between island 1 and island 2, and between island 1 and island 3, and Everule can still visit island 4 via islands 2 and 3. Thus, Everule can visit 4 islands, not 3.

The correct approach should consider that Dominater can disconnect island 1 from the rest of the islands by destroying \( n - 1 \) bridges, but if fewer bridges are destroyed, Everule can still visit more islands than just 1 or \( n - 1 \).

Given the incorrect logic in the program, let's provide a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**
For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), the program outputs 3, but the correct answer is 4.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
