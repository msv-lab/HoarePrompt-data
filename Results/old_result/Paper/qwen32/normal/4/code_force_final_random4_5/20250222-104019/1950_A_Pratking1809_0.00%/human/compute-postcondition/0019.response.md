The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `q`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `q` is greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mn` is 100**
