To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, we need to analyze the expression inside the `print` statement and understand how the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are used.

### Given:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1 (0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input from the user.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```python
print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - `(b - a) / 2`: This calculates the average difference between `b` and `a`. Since we are using integer division (`/` followed by `int()`), the result will be an integer.
   - `(b - a + 1)`: This is the count of integers from `a` to `b` inclusive.
   - `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)`: This part calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `a` to `b`. The sum of the arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence: \( \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term}) \). Here, `k` is the number of terms, which is `b - a + 1`, the first term is `a`, and the last term is `b`. However, the formula used in the code is slightly different but mathematically equivalent.
   - `a * n`: This part simply multiplies `a` by `n`.

2. **Combining the Results**:
   - The overall expression calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `a` to `b` and then adds `a * n` to it.

### Output:
Given the initial state and the expression, the output will be the result of the arithmetic operation described above. Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **The result of the expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` (where `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input from the user)**
