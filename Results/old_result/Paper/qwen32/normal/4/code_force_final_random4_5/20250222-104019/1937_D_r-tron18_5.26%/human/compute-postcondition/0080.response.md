Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el` and now includes an additional element which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `ol` and `zr` are recalculated; `oneInd` and `zr` are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`; `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

In simple terms, the value at index `i` in the list `ans` is updated to be the result of the expression `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables retain their previous values or have already been recalculated as per the conditions given in the initial state.
