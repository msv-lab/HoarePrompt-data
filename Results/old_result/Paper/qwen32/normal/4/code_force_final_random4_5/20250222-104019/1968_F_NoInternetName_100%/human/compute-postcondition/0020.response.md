Output State: **`a` remains the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` remain the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0] + [cumulative XOR results]` where each element is the XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs. The current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, all variables retain their initial values and conditions.
