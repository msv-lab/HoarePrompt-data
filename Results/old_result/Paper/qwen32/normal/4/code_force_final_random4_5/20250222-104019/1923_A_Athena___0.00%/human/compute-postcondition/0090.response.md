The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of the variable `res` by 1. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 2 to 1000, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `res` is incremented by 1.**
