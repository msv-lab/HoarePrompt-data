Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains a logical error in determining whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. Here, `a` should be `b` (the number of moves) and `b` should be `c` (the number of cubes). Additionally, the condition `elif b < c:` is also incorrect because it doesn't consider the parity of the numbers of moves and cubes.

The correct logic should be:
- If `b` (number of moves) is less than `c` (number of cubes), it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
- Otherwise, check if the parity (even or odd nature) of `b` and `c` is the same. If they have the same parity, it's possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each move changes the parity of the number of cubes (from even to odd or odd to even), so after an even number of moves, the parity of the number of cubes will be the same as it started (which is 0, i.e., even), and after an odd number of moves, the parity will be different (odd).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This program will correctly determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
