Output State: **The program returns `frequency_table`, which is a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list `arr` and its value is the minimum of the number's occurrences in `arr` and `k`.**

This means that for each unique number in the list `arr`, the dictionary `frequency_table` will have that number as a key, and the value associated with that key will be the lesser of how many times the number appears in `arr` and the integer `k`.
