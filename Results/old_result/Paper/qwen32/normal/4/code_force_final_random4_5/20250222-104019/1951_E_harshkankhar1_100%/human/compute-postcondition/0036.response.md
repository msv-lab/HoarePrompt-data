Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State
1. `s` is the input string.
2. `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
3. `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`.
4. `func_1(s[0:])` returns True.
5. `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True.
6. `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

### Print Statement
```python
print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

### Analysis
- `s[:x + 2]` will print the substring of `s` from the beginning up to and including the character at index `x + 1` (since Python slicing is exclusive of the end index).
- `s[x + 2:]` will print the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

### Key Points
- `x` is the first index (1-based) where the character in `s` is different from `s[0]`. Since it is 1-based, the 0-based index of this character is `x - 1`.
- `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`. This means the first differing character is not at the very start (index 1 in 1-based, which is index 0 in 0-based) and it is not exactly in the middle of the string.
- `func_1(s[0:])` and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returning True indicate that the function `func_1` is satisfied for the entire string `s` and the substring starting from the character after the first differing character.

### Output Description
- The first part of the print statement, `s[:x + 2]`, will include the starting character of `s` and the first differing character (plus one more character after it).
- The second part of the print statement, `s[x + 2:]`, will include all characters after the first differing character and the character immediately following it.

### Example
Let's consider an example to illustrate:
- Suppose `s = "aaabbbccc"`.
- `s[0]` is 'a'.
- The first character that is different from 'a' is 'b', which is at index 3 (1-based). So `x = 3`.
- `s[:x + 2]` translates to `s[:5]` which is `"aaabb"`.
- `s[x + 2:]` translates to `s[5:]` which is `"bbccc"`.

### Final Output
Based on the analysis, the output will be:
Output: **s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] is the substring from the start of s up to and including the character at index x + 1, and s[x + 2:] is the substring from the character at index x + 2 to the end of s)**

However, to make it more precise and clear:
Output: **s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] includes the first differing character and the character after it, and s[x + 2:] includes all characters after the character after the first differing character)**
