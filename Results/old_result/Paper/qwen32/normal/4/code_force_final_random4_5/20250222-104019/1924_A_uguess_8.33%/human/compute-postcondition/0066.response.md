The given Python code snippet updates the value of `cur_ss` based on the current character `ss` in the string `s`. The value of `cur_ss` is calculated as the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', which effectively maps 'a' to 0, 'b' to 1, ..., 'z' to 25.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is affected by this line of code is `cur_ss`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'), specifically `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')`; If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` retains its value; The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`**.
