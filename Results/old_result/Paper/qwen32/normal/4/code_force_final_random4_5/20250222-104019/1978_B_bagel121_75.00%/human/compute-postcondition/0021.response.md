Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is calculated as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`.
- `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n * a)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print(n * a)` directly computes and prints the product of `n` and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `a` is an integer read from the input.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n * a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `n` and `a`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the product of `n` and `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers read from the input)**
