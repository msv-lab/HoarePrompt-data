The code snippet updates the value of `diff1` by recalculating it as the absolute difference between the current element `i` from list `a` and the first element of the sorted list `b`. This change only affects the variable `diff1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` contains one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains one tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `i` is the next element in `a` after the current one.**
