The code assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `l`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `q` is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[2n + 2(q-1) + 3]`; `q` is greater than 0; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`.**
