The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'8'`. The initial state describes various conditions and constraints related to the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print('8')` statement. The `print` function is instructed to output the string `'8'` regardless of the values or conditions of the other variables.

Hence, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'8'`.

Output: **8**
