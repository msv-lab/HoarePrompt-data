Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic used in the function `func_1` is not appropriate for ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins by setting up at most 60 stalls with specific prices.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Price Calculation Logic**: The program currently calculates the prices in a way that doesn't guarantee Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. The prices are set as `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which is not a general solution for any `n` and `k`.

2. **Handling of Multiple Stalls**: The program only considers two stalls, which is not sufficient for all cases, especially when `k` is large and requires more stalls to reach the exact number of jewels.

3. **General Case Handling**: The program does not handle the general case where Alice might need to visit up to 60 stalls with different prices to buy exactly `k` jewels.

A correct approach would involve setting up prices in a way that ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One possible strategy is to use binary powers to cover the required number of jewels, as shown in the example output. Here is an improved version of the program that follows this strategy:

```python
import math

def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Try to use binary representation to cover k jewels
    stalls = []
    remaining = k
    i = 0
    while remaining > 0 and len(stalls) < 60:
        if remaining & 1:
            stalls.append(2**i)
        remaining >>= 1
        i += 1
    
    if len(stalls) > 60 or remaining != 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Adjust prices to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels
    total_coins_needed = sum(stalls)
    if total_coins_needed > n:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    print('YES')
    print(len(stalls))
    print(*stalls)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, k)
```

This version of the program uses binary representation to determine the number of stalls and their prices, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It also checks if the total cost of the jewels does not exceed `n` coins.
