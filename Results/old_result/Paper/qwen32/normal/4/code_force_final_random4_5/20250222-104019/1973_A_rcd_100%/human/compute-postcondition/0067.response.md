The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value `-1`. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step explanation:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` is at least 1, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. However, these variables are not utilized in the given code snippet.
2. The `print(-1)` statement directly outputs the integer `-1`.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
