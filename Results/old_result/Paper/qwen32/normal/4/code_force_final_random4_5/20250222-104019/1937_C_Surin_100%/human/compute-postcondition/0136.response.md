The code snippet `r2 = input('')` reads a new input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `v1 + 2`, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `kp` is unchanged, `i` is `v1 + 2`, `r` is the user's new input, `prev` remains 0 unless `r` is `'>'` or `'='` with specific conditions, `r2` is the user's input.**
