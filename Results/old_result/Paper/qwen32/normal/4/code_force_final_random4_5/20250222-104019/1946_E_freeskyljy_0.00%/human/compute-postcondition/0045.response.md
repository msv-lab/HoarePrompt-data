Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -1; `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is 2; `i` is equal to `R[cur]` and `R[0]` is less than `N - 1`.**

Natural language: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The value of `i` is now equal to `R[cur]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
