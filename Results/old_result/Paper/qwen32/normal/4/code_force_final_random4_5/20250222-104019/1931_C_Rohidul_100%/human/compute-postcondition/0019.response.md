To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` are true. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `l` is the index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]` or `l == r`
- `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0
- `r` is `l`
- `a[l] == a[l + 1]`
- `end` is incremented by 1

From the state, we know:
- `r` is currently equal to `l`, so the condition `r > l` is false.
- `a[r] == a[r - 1]` might be true or false, but it doesn't matter because the first condition `r > l` is already false.

To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `r > l` is true. We can do this by incrementing `r` by 1, assuming that `r + 1` is within the bounds of the array `a` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` remains true.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`l` is the index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]` or `l == r - 1`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0, `r` is `l + 1`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `end` is incremented by 1**
