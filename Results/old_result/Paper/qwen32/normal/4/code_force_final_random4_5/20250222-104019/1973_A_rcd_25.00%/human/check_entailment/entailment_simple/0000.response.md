### Reasoning:
Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the given problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, representing the scores of the three players, sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Sum of Scores Check:**
   - The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points from all games must be even (since each game awards either 0, 1, or 2 points).
   - If the sum is even, the program proceeds to determine the maximum number of draws.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - **Case 1:** If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the third player could have played all games against the other two players and won all of them, leaving the first two players with their scores as the total number of draws.
   - **Case 2:** If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program calculates the possible range of draws. The variables `low` and `high` represent the minimum and maximum possible number of draws involving the third player.
   - The program then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid configuration where the scores can be achieved. Specifically, it checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, where `cur` is the current number of draws. If this condition holds, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` as the maximum number of draws.
   - If no valid configuration is found, it prints `p3` as the maximum number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (`p1 = p2 = p3 = 0`) by printing `0`, which is correct.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the scores are not achievable by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores and handles various edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness:** **True**
