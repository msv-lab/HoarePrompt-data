The code snippet provided increments the variable `s` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `s` changes from 0 to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, and the current character `b[j]` is '@'.**
