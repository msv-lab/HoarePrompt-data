Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- **Prices**:
  - One yogurt costs `a` burles.
  - Two yogurts cost `b` burles (promotion price).
- **Constraints**:
  - `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (number of test cases)
  - `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` (number of yogurts to buy)
  - `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30` (prices)

### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n  # Cost if buying all yogurts at the regular price
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2  # Cost if buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)  # If n is 1, just buy one yogurt at the regular price
```

### Function Summary:
- The function processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case:
  - If `n > 1`, it calculates two costs:
    - `ans1`: Cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
    - `ans2`: Cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and any remaining yogurt at the regular price (`b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).
  - It prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
  - If `n == 1`, it prints `a` directly.

### Analysis of Correctness:
1. **For `n == 1`**:
   - The program correctly prints `a` because buying one yogurt at the regular price is the only option.
   - **Example**: For `n = 1`, `a = 5`, and `b = 9`, the output should be `5`, which is correct.

2. **For `n > 1`**:
   - **`ans1` Calculation**:
     - `ans1 = a * n` correctly calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
     - **Example**: For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 9`, `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`.
   - **`ans2` Calculation**:
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` calculates the cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt (if any) is bought at the regular price.
     - This formula is correct because:
       - `b * n // 2` calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
       - `a * n % 2` calculates the cost of the remaining yogurt (if any) at the regular price.
     - **Example**: For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 9`, `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 0 = 13` (correct).
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`, ensuring the minimum cost is chosen.
     - **Example**: For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 9`, `min(15, 13) = 13` (correct).

### Verification with Example Cases:
1. **Input**: `2 5 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `3 5 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Output: `14` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `3 5 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Output: `15` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `4 5 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Output: `20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum cost for all possible values of `n`, `a`, and `b` within the given constraints. It handles both the case where `n == 1` and `n > 1` appropriately.

**Final: True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct.
