Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and deleting them.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Optimal Strategy:
- Alice should aim to include as many small integers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
- Bob should aim to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c` to minimize the MEX.
- The MEX will be determined by the smallest integer that is not included in `c` after all elements are picked.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

3. **Determine MEX:**
   - The program iterates over the range `[0, n]` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `arr` or has only one occurrence (after Alice's first move).
   - The program prints this integer `i` as the MEX.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly simulate the game's turns between Alice and Bob.
- The program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob have different strategies (maximizing and minimizing MEX respectively).
- The program incorrectly assumes that the MEX is determined by the first integer with a count of 1, which is not necessarily true.

### Correct Approach:
- Both players will try to influence the MEX by their choices.
- Alice will try to add the smallest integers possible to `c`.
- Bob will try to remove these integers from `a` as quickly as possible.
- The final MEX will be the smallest integer that is not included in `c` after all elements are picked.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game or determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: False**
