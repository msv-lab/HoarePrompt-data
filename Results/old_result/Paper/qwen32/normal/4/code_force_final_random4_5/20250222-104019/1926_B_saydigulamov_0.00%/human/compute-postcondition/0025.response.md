The code snippet `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the digit '1' in the string representation of `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is a positive integer and contains the digit '1', `b.count('1')` will return the number of times '1' appears in `b`. This count is then added to the list `k`.

Output State: **The next input must be a positive integer; `b` is a positive integer, and `b` contains the digit '1'; `k` has an additional element which is the count of the digit '1' in `b`.**
