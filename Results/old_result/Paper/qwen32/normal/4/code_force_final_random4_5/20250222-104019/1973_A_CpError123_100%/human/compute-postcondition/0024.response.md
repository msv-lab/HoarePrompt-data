The code snippet `y = a + b` reassigns the value of `y` to be the sum of `a` and `b`. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged. The new value of `y` is explicitly defined as `a + b`.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers from the new input with their sum being odd, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`**.
