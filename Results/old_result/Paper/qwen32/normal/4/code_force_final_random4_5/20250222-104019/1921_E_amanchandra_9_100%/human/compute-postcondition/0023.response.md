To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given code and the initial state step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables from Input:**
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers from the input.
   - `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and it is decreased by 1.

2. **Derived Variables:**
   - `x` is calculated as `abs(a - c) // 2`.
   - `r` is calculated as `min(w, d + x)`.
   - `l` is calculated as `max(1, d - x)`.

3. **Condition in Print Statement:**
   - `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`
   - If the condition is true, it prints `['Alice']`.
   - If the condition is false, it prints `['Draw']`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `x`:**
   - `x = abs(a - c) // 2`
   - This means `x` is half the absolute difference between `a` and `c`.

2. **Calculate `r`:**
   - `r = min(w, d + x)`
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `d + x`.

3. **Calculate `l`:**
   - `l = max(1, d - x)`
   - `l` is the maximum of `1` and `d - x`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - The condition is `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`.
   - This checks if `b` is within `x + 1` units of both `l` and `r`.

### Output Determination:
- If the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` evaluates to `True`, the output will be `['Alice']`.
- If the condition evaluates to `False`, the output will be `['Draw']`.

Since we don't have specific values for `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `w`, and `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `x`, `r`, and `l`. However, we can describe the output based on the condition.

### Final Output:
Output: **['Draw'] or ['Alice'] depending on whether the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` is True or False**
