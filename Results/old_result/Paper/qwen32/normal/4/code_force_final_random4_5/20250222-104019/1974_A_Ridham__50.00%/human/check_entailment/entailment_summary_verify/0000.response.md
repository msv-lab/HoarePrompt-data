Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment. We'll focus on the logic and correctness of the program using the function summary and problem description.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is simply `x`.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, representing the total cells occupied by `y` 2x2 icons.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If `y` is even, the program calculates the number of screens required as `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, the program calculates the number of screens required as `y // 2 + 1`.
   - This logic is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. Thus, two 2x2 icons can fit in one screen, and if there is an odd number of 2x2 icons, an additional screen is needed.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons on the screens as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This calculation is correct for determining the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

5. **Extra Screen Calculation**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the program appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the extra screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The logic for calculating extra screens is `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space` is not zero, which is correct for determining the number of additional screens needed.

### Testing with Edge Cases

Let's consider some test cases to verify the correctness of the program:

1. **Case 1**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`
   - No icons, so the program should return `0` screens.
   - The program correctly returns `0` screens.

2. **Case 2**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - One 1x1 icon and one 2x2 icon. The 2x2 icon requires one screen, and the remaining 11 cells can fit the 1x1 icon.
   - The program correctly returns `1` screen.

3. **Case 3**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
   - Two 2x2 icons require one screen, and the remaining 7 cells can fit the 7 1x1 icons.
   - The program correctly returns `1` screen.

4. **Case 4**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
   - Four 2x2 icons require two screens, and there are no remaining cells for the 12 1x1 icons, so two additional screens are needed.
   - The program correctly returns `2` screens.

5. **Case 5**: `x = 0`, `y = 3`
   - Three 2x2 icons require two screens.
   - The program correctly returns `2` screens.

6. **Case 6**: `x = 15`, `y = 0`
   - Fifteen 1x1 icons require one screen.
   - The program correctly returns `1` screen.

7. **Case 7**: `x = 0`, `y = 9`
   - Nine 2x2 icons require five screens.
   - The program correctly returns `5` screens.

8. **Case 8**: `x = 8`, `y = 2`
   - Two 2x2 icons require one screen, and the remaining 7 cells can fit the 8 1x1 icons, but since 7 cells are not enough, one additional screen is needed.
   - The program correctly returns `2` screens.

### Conclusion

The program handles all the test cases correctly based on the analysis. The logic for calculating the number of screens required is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
