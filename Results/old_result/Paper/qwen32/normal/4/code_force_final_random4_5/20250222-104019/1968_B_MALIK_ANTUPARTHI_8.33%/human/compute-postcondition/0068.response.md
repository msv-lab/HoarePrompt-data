Let's break down the given information and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `b` is an integer greater than 0.
- `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1.
- `d` and `e` are the new input strings.
- `j` is `b - 1`.
- `k` is `b`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is explicitly defined as `b`.
- The value of `b` is given as an integer greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state. It is only known that `b > 0`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k)` statement will output the value of `k`, which is the same as the value of `b`. Since the exact value of `b` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `b`.

### Output:
Output: **k (where k is the value of b, and b is an integer greater than 0)**
