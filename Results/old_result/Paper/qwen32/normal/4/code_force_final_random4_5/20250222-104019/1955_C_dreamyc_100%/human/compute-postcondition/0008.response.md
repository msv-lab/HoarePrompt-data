The code snippet `s_a += nums[i]` adds the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `s_a`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, the value of `s_a` is initially 0. After the operation, `s_a` will be `nums[i]` added to its previous value, which is 0. Therefore, `s_a` will now be equal to `nums[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `ans` is 0; `s_a` is `nums[i]`; `s_b` is 0**.
