The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `x` and `y` based on the input, while the other variables will retain their initial states.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 â‰¤ x_i, y_i â‰¤ 1000, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**.
