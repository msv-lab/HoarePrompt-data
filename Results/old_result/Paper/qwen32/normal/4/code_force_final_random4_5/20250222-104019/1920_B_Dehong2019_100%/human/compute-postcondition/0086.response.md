The value of `ans1` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. The values of `k`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged as per the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `ans2` is the maximum value between `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`; `ans1` is `ans1` plus `a[i]`**.
