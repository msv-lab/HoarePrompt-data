Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. The integer `n` is between 1 and 26, `k` is between 1 and 26, and `m` is between 1 and 1000. The string `s` is of length `m` and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function processes each test case and returns a specific output based on the provided inputs.**
