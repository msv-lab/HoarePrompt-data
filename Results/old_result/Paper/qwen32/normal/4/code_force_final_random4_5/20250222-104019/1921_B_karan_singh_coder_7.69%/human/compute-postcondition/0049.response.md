The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t` are different. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the new `t`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`.**
