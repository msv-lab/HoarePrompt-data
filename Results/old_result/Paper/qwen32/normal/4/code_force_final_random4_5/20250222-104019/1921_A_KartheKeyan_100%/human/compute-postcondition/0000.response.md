The provided code snippet reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l`, calculates a value `s` based on the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2`, prints the value of `s`, and then decrements `n` by 1 until `n` becomes 0. The initial state includes the coordinates of the corners of a square, but these coordinates are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

Let's break down the impact of the code on the variables:
1. `n` starts as a positive integer representing the number of test cases. It is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop until it reaches 0.
2. `l` is an integer read from the input for each test case.
3. `s` is calculated for each test case and printed.

Since the code snippet does not modify the initial state's coordinates of the square and only processes the test cases, we need to reflect the changes in `n` and the calculation of `s` for each test case.

If we assume `n` was initially `t` (the number of test cases), after processing all test cases, `n` will be 0. The coordinates of the square remain unchanged.

Output State: **Each test case consists of four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; `n` is 0.**
