Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the elements from `a[1]` to `a[n]` which are `int(data[index])` for each respective iteration; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 5 + n`, which simplifies to `2n + 5`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each respective iteration; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `q` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the elements from `a[1]` to `a[n]` which are `int(data[index])` for each respective iteration; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 7`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO') with an additional 'YES' if `x` equals 0, and now also contains an additional 'YES' if `it1` is less than the length of `v1`, `it2` is greater than or equal to 0, and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`. Otherwise, `results` contains an additional 'NO'; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each respective iteration; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved; `l` is `int(data[2n + 5])`; `r` is `int(data[2n + 6])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the insertion point in `v1` for the value `l` found using binary search; `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `q` is greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the elements from `a[1]` to `a[n]` which are `int(data[index - 2])` for each respective iteration; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 9`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each respective iteration; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved; `l` is `int(data[2n + 7])`; `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the insertion point in `v1` for the value `l` found using binary search; `it2` is the insertion point in `v2` for the value `r` found using binary search, minus 1`. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `results` includes an additional 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes an additional 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `q` is greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the elements from `a[1]` to `a[n]` which are `int(data[index - 3])` for each respective iteration; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 11`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each respective iteration; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved; `l` is `int(data[2n + 9])`; `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the insertion point in `v1` for the value `l` found using binary search; `it2` is the insertion point in `v2` for the value `r` found using binary search, minus 1`. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `results` includes an additional 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes an additional 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
