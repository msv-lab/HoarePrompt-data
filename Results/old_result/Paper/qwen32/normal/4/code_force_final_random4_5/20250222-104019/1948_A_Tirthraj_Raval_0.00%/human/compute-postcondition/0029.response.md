The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the `pattern` list based on the value of `i % 2`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this statement, the new value of `i` determines what gets appended. If `i` was even, `i % 2` would be 0, and 'B' would be appended. If `i` was odd, `i % 2` would be 1, and 'A' would be appended. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 0 to 49, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `pattern` is a list containing either 'A' or 'B' with an additional element that is 'B' if the new `i` is even and 'A' if the new `i` is odd, `i` is incremented by 1**.
