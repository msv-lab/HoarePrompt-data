The value of `v2` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged except for `i` which is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1, and `v2` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1, `v2` is equal to `i`.**
