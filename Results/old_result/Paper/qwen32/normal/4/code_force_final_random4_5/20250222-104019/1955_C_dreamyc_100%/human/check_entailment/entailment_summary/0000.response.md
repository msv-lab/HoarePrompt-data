Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by considering the cumulative sum of the durability of ships from both ends and comparing these sums to half of the total attacks `k`. However, the logic used in the function `func_1` is incorrect. The function does not properly account for the alternating attacks between the first and last ships and does not correctly determine the number of ships that have sunk.

Here's a breakdown of why the logic is flawed:
1. The function calculates `a` as `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `b` as `k // 2`. These values represent the maximum cumulative durability that can be reduced from the start and end of the list, respectively, in `k` attacks.
2. The function then iterates through the list, maintaining cumulative sums `s_a` and `s_b` from the start and end of the list.
3. The function increments the answer `ans` whenever `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. However, this logic does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks and does not account for the fact that once a ship's durability reaches zero, it is no longer attacked.

The correct approach would involve simulating the alternating attacks, reducing the durability of the first and last ships until they sink, and counting the number of ships that have sunk. This requires a more detailed and accurate simulation of the attack process.

Given the flaws in the provided logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
