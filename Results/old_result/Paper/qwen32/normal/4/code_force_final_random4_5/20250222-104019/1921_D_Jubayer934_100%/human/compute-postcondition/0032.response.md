To determine the output of the `print(sum(ans))` statement, we need to understand the values and states of the variables involved, especially `ans`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input.
   - `b` is a sorted list of the first `m` integers from the input, in descending order.
   - `ans` is a list that will store the absolute differences between elements from `a` and `b`.

2. **Loop and Calculation:**
   - The loop iterates through the elements of `a` and `b` to calculate absolute differences.
   - The loop breaks when a certain condition is met, and the index `i` at which the loop breaks is stored in `temp`.
   - If `temp` is not -1, then `ans` is a list of `n` absolute differences.
   - If `temp` is -1, then `ans` is a list of `min(n, i+1)` absolute differences.

3. **Sum of Differences:**
   - `sum(ans)` will sum up all the elements in the `ans` list.
   - The exact value of `sum(ans)` depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and the point where the loop breaks (if it does).

### Output Description:

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and the point where the loop breaks are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `sum(ans)`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

- **If `temp` is not -1:** The `ans` list contains `n` absolute differences, and `sum(ans)` will be the sum of these `n` differences.
- **If `temp` is -1:** The `ans` list contains `min(n, i+1)` absolute differences, and `sum(ans)` will be the sum of these differences.

### Final Output:

Given the information, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **sum(ans) (where ans is a list of absolute differences between elements from the sorted list `a` and the sorted list `b` in descending order, with the length of ans being `n` if `temp` is not -1, or `min(n, i+1)` if `temp` is -1)**
