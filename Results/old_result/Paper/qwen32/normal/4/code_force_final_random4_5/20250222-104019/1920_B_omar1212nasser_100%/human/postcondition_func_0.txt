The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a` and calculates a product using the function `func_2` with parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. It then prints the result of this product calculation for each test case.
