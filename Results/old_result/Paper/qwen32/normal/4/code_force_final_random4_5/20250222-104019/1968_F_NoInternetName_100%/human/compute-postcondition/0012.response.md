The code appends a new element to the list `x` which is the result of the XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the variable `i`. Given the initial state, `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i, 0]`, and the new element will be `0 ^ i ^ i`, which simplifies to `0` because `i ^ i` equals `0` for any integer `i`.

Thus, the updated list `x` will be `[0, 0 ^ i, 0, 0]`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i, 0, 0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[0, 1]`, `i` is the next element in `a`**.
