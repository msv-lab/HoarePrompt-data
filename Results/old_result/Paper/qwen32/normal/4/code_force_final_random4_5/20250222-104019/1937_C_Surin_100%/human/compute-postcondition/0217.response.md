Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. For each test case, it interacts with an external system by asking up to 3n queries to compare the bitwise OR of specific pairs of elements. Based on the responses, it identifies and outputs the indices of the two elements that maximize their bitwise XOR.**
