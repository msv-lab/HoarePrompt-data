Postcondition: **`start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` has one less node, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start`, `current` is the node that was at the front of `queue`, `dist` is the distance associated with the `current` node if it was part of a tuple, otherwise it is the node itself. If `current` equals `target`, the program returns `dist`, which is the shortest distance from `start` to `target`. Otherwise, `dist` will be the distance to the last node processed.**
