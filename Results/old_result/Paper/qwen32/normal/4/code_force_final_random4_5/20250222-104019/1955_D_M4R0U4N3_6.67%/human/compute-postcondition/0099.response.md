The code snippet `old = a[r - m]` assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. The values of `done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. The variable `old` is newly introduced and holds the value from the list `a` at the index `r - m`.

Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, `todo` is an empty set, `extra` is the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`, `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `m` must be less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[r - m]`**.
