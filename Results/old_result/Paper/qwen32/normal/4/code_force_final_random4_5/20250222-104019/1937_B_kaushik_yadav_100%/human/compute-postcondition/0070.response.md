Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string with length at least 2; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is a string of length `len(a)` composed of characters from `a` and `b` based on the value of `work` at each step; `i` is `len(a)`; `work` is either `True` or `False`; `j` is `len(a) - 2`; the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their initial states, and the only change is that the loop or statement is exited.
