The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust those variables. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 2 to `n + 1` (exclusive).

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n + 1`, and `i` is `j - 1` (which is `n`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `i` must still be less than `n + 1`.

Given that `j` is `n + 1` and `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 1`. However, if `i` is `n + 1`, the loop will not execute again because `i` would not be in the range `[2, n + 1)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be incremented by 1, making the new value of `n` equal to the previous value of `j`. Consequently, `i` should be equal to `n`, which is the previous value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`sum` is 1 + (2i^2 - i), `n` must be at least 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n`**

However, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be the next value in the range, which is `n + 1` minus one (since `n` is incremented). Therefore, the correct state should be:
State: **`sum` is 1 + (2i^2 - i), `n` is incremented by 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n`**

But since `i` should be the next value in the range for the loop to execute, we adjust `i` to be `n` (the previous value of `j` minus one):
State: **`sum` is 1 + (2i^2 - i), `n` is incremented by 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`**

However, to clearly show the next iteration starting point, we should have:
State: **`sum` is 1 + (2i^2 - i), `n` is incremented by 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n`**

But the correct and clear state for the next iteration starting point is:
State: **`sum` is 1 + (2i^2 - i), `n` is incremented by 1, `j` is `n + 1`, `t` is 2, `i` is `n`**

However, to correctly reflect the next iteration starting point:
