The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(i - b[m - 1])` to the variable `diff2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Here, `b[m - 1]` refers to the last element of the sorted list `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99.
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split substring to an integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a new input string, converting each split substring to an integer, and sorting the resulting list in ascending order.
- `max_heap` is an empty list.
- `tp1` is 0.
- `tp2` is `m - 1`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`.

After executing the code snippet, `diff2` is calculated as `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`.**
