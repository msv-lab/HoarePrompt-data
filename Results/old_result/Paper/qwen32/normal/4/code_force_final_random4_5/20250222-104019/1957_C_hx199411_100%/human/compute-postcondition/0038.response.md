The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous values in the `dp` list. Specifically, `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given that `i` is 5, we need to compute `dp[5]`.

Using the provided formula:
`dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`

We are given:
- `dp[4]` is already calculated as `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[3]` is not provided directly, but it can be calculated using the same formula: `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[1]` is 1

First, calculate `dp[3]`:
`dp[3] = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7`

Next, calculate `dp[4]`:
`dp[4] = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (7 + 18) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 25`

Finally, calculate `dp[5]`:
`dp[5] = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (25 + 56) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 81`

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `m`, and the rest of the `dp` list remain unchanged except for `dp[5]` which has been updated.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num` and `m` must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with `dp[1]` as 1, `dp[2]` as 3, `dp[3]` as 7, `dp[4]` as 25, and `dp[5]` as 81, `i` is 5**.
