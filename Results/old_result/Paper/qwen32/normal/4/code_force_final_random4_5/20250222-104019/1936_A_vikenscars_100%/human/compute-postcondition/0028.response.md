The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

### Analysis:

- **`n`**: This variable defines the range of the loop and does not change within the loop. It remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.
- **`i`**: This variable is the loop counter and is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

### Given State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.
- `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` in the range 1 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', or 0 if `func_1` never returns '<'.
- `ans1` remains '<' if it was '<', or '=' if it was '='.
- `ans2` is either '>', or the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` if `ans2` is not '>'.
- `pair_idx` is 0 if `ans1` is '<', or either 0 (if `ans2` is '>') or remains equal to `max_item_idx` (if `ans2` is not '>').
- `i` is 0 if `ans1` is '<', or remains 0 if `ans1` is '='.

### Adjustment for the Next Iteration:
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.
- `max_item_idx` remains the same.
- `ans1` remains the same.
- `ans2` remains the same.
- `pair_idx` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
