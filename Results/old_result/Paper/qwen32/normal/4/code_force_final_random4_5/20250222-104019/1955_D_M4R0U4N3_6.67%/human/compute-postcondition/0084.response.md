Postcondition: **`done`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `j` are defined as per the initial conditions. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `done` contains `a[j]`, `todo` excludes `a[j]`, and `extra` remains empty. Otherwise, `done` remains empty, `todo` remains unchanged, and `extra` contains `a[j]`. The count `ans` reflects the number of times the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
