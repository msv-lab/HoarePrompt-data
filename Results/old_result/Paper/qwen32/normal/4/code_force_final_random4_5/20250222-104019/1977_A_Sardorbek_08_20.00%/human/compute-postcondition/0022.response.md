The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides some information about the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'Yes'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`.
2. The string `'Yes'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `q` are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
