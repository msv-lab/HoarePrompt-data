Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a`**: A list returned by `func_1(int)`.
2. **`n` and `q`**: Values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 0.
3. **`l` and `r`**: New values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`.
4. **`x`**: A list defined as `[0] + [cumulative XOR results]`. Each element in `x` (after the first) is the XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`.
5. **`inds`**: A `defaultdict` of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs.
6. **Condition**: The current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.
- The value of `'Yes'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

### Output:
Output: **Yes**
