Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is 1. If `a[1]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is a set of integers read from the input with `a[1]` removed, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]` if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`, otherwise `done` is a set containing `a[1]`, and `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo` initially, otherwise `extra` is an empty set. Otherwise, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was initially in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not initially in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, and `extra` now also contains `a[1]`.**
