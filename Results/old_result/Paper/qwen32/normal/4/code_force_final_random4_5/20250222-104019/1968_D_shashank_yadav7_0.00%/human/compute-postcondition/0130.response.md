The code snippet provided updates the value of `bm` by adding the maximum of `bm` and the expression `a[b] * k + bp` to it. Given that `k` is -1, the expression `a[b] * k + bp` simplifies to `bp - a[b]`. Therefore, the new value of `bm` will be the maximum of its current value and `bp - a[b]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i`, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `sm` is `a[s]`, `bm` is `max(bm, bp - a[b])`, and `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the value of `bm` is updated to be the larger of its current value and the value of `bp - a[b]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
