Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The given program, however, does not implement this logic. Instead, it appears to be trying to calculate something related to divisors or some other mathematical property, but it does not match the problem's requirements.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function Name and Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1()` is reading `n` and `k` from the input, but the problem description mentions `n` and `m`. This is inconsistent.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program calculates `ans` and then iterates to add values based on a loop that doesn't seem to relate to the problem's conditions.
   - The condition `ans += (n + i) // cnt` does not align with the problem's requirement to check pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case `(1, 1)`, the output should be `1` because the only pair \((1, 1)\) satisfies the condition. The program outputs `1` for this case, but this is a coincidence and not due to correct logic.
   - For the fourth test case `(10, 8)`, the program outputs `14`, but the correct output is `14` based on the valid pairs listed in the problem description. However, the logic in the program does not match how these pairs are counted.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The provided logic does not correctly count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider a simple case:
- Input: `n = 2, m = 3`
- Expected Output: `3` (pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2))
- Program Output: `4` (which is incorrect)

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly implement the required logic.
