To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, let's analyze the provided loop condition:

```python
while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if both conditions are true:
1. `j < m`
2. `b[j] != a[i]`

Given the state right before the loop:
- `i` is incremented by 1

Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `j`, `m`, `b`, and `a` are set such that both conditions of the loop can be satisfied.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition `j < m`:**
   - We need to ensure that `j` is less than `m`. This can be achieved by setting `j` to a value that is less than `m`. For simplicity, we can set `j` to 0 and `m` to a value greater than 0, e.g., `m` can be 1 or more.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`:**
   - We need to ensure that the element at index `j` in array `b` is not equal to the element at index `i` in array `a`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 before the loop starts, we need to know the initial value of `i` to set `a[i]` appropriately. However, since the initial value of `i` is not provided, we can assume `i` was 0 before the increment, making `i` equal to 1 right before the loop.
   - Let's assume `a[1]` is some value, say `a[1] = 5`.
   - We need to set `b[0]` (since `j` is 0) to a value different from `a[1]`. So, we can set `b[0]` to a value other than 5, say `b[0] = 3`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 1 (since it was incremented by 1 before the loop).
- `j` is 0.
- `m` is 1 (or any value greater than 0).
- `a[1]` is 5.
- `b[0]` is 3.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `a[1]` is not equal to `b[0]`**

To make it more concrete:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 0, `m` is 1, `a[1]` is 5, `b[0]` is 3**

This state ensures that both conditions of the `while` loop are satisfied, allowing the loop to execute its first iteration.
