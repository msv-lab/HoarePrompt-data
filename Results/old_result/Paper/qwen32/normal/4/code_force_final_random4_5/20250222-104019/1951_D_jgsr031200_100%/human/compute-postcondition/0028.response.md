Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

1. `n` is 0.
2. `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\).
3. `costs` is a list defined as `[n - k + 1, 1]`. Substituting the value of `n`, this becomes `[-k + 1, 1]`.
4. `h` is calculated as `n // (n - k + 1) + (k - 1)`. Substituting the value of `n` and simplifying, we get `0 // (-k + 1) + (k - 1)`, which simplifies to `0 + (k - 1) = k - 1`.

The precondition also mentions that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. However, based on the calculation, `h` is `k - 1`, which contradicts the precondition unless `k` is 1 (since `h` would then be 0, which is not greater than or equal to 1). Given the precondition, we should assume that the initial state is consistent with `h` being at least `k`, but the calculation shows `h` as `k - 1`. This implies that the precondition might be misstated or there's an implicit assumption that `k` is 1 for the condition to hold.

Regardless, the print statement in the code is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string 'YES', and it does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`.

Output: **YES**
