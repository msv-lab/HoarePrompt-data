The code snippet appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that `queue` will now have one more node, specifically `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. The `visited` set remains unchanged because the condition for modifying `visited` is not addressed in this snippet; it is only mentioned as a precondition.

Output State: **`start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` has one more node which is `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` includes `neighbor`. `current` is a key in `tree` and `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `dist` is the distance associated with the `current` node if it was part of a tuple, otherwise it is the node itself, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`.**
