Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for all test cases. Specifically, it does not efficiently account for the placement of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the 5x3 grid, and it incorrectly calculates the remaining cells and additional screens needed.

Here are a few reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells**: The program calculates `remaining_cells` as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, which is not accurate because it does not consider how the 2x2 icons are placed and the remaining space in a more optimal way.

2. **Incorrect Handling of 1x1 Icons**: After placing the 2x2 icons, the program does not correctly determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining spaces. It simply subtracts the space used by 2x2 icons from the total grid space and then tries to fill the rest with 1x1 icons, which might not be optimal.

3. **Suboptimal Screen Calculation**: The program does not account for the fact that 2x2 icons can be placed in different configurations, and sometimes it might be more efficient to place fewer 2x2 icons to leave more space for 1x1 icons.

To fix these issues, a more sophisticated approach is needed to determine the optimal placement of icons on the grid. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming to find the best way to place the icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens = 0
        # Try to place as many 2x2 icons as possible
        while y > 0:
            screens += 1
            if y >= 2:
                y -= 2
                x -= 3  # Place 2 2x2 icons, leaving 3 1x1 spaces
            else:
                y -= 1
                x -= 5  # Place 1 2x2 icon, leaving 5 1x1 spaces
            x = max(x, 0)  # Ensure x is not negative
        # Place remaining 1x1 icons
        if x > 0:
            screens += (x + 14) // 15  # Each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons
        result.append(screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the 2x2 icons are placed optimally, and then it calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
