The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. This overwrites the previous value of `arr` with the new input list. The values of `t`, `n`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the previous `arr`; `first` is `True` if there is at least one element in the previous `arr` with a frequency of 1, otherwise `False`; `i` is `n + 1`.**
