#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):

    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1

        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` that did not have their flipped counterparts already in `count` at the time of their encounter, and `count` contains the flipped values of the numbers encountered in `a` with their respective counts.
    return res
    #The program returns `res`, which is the number of unique elements in `a` that did not have their flipped counterparts already in `count` at the time of their encounter.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique elements in `a` that do not have their bitwise flipped counterparts already encountered in the list.
