The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means that the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are now determined by the input, and the initial conditions regarding `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input from the user.**
