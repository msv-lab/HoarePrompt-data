To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0.
   - `cur` is initialized to 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the loop body, it suggests that the loop runs `t` times).

2. **Loop Body**:
   - For each character `ss` in the string `s`:
     - `cur_ss` is calculated as the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').
     - If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set, it is set.
     - If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1` (which means all the first `k` bits are set), `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0.

### Understanding the Condition `(1 << k) - 1`

- `(1 << k) - 1` is a binary number with the first `k` bits set to 1. For example, if `k` is 3, `(1 << 3) - 1` is `0b111` (which is 7 in decimal).

### Loop Completion

The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The variable `cur` keeps track of the unique characters encountered so far using a bitmask. When `cur` reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means that `k` unique characters have been encountered, and `cnt` is incremented.

### Final Output State

After the loop completes, the state of the variables will be:
- `cnt` will contain the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence.
- `cur` will be 0 if the last sequence of characters did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, or it will be some bitmask representing the unique characters encountered in the last incomplete sequence.
- `i` will be `t + 1` because it is incremented at the start of each loop iteration, and the loop runs `t` times.

### Output State

Output State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is `t + 1`.**

In simple terms, `cnt` tells us how many times we found a sequence of `k` unique characters, `cur` tells us the state of the last sequence (if it was incomplete), and `i` is incremented by `t` indicating the number of iterations.
