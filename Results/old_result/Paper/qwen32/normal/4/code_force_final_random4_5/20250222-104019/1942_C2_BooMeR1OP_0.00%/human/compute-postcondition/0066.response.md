To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of the variable `ans` based on the initial state provided. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `ans`. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of `ans` itself.

Given that no specific value or formula for `ans` is provided, the output will simply be the value of `ans` as it is.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of the variable ans)**
