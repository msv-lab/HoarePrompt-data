The code provided initializes a variable `back` with a very large negative number. The other variables `cities`, `prog_cities`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given line of code.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case with `n` (where `n` is at least 2) cities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` as the coordinates of the cities, `m` as the number of queries, and `x_i, y_i` as the queries; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros; `i` is 0; `back` is -99999999999999999999.**
