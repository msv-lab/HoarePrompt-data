The code snippet `temp = -1` sets the variable `temp` to -1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `temp-1`, and if a break occurred, it also includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for `i` from `temp` to `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
