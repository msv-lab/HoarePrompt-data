The variable `ans` is updated to include the character at index `i` of the string `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and the condition `i < len(a)` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]`**.
