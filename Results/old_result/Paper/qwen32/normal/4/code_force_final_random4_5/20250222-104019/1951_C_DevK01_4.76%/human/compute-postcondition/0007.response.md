Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.**

In natural language: The value of `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, where `k` is `L[2]` and `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
