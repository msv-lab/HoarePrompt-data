The given code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the values of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`. Here's the calculation:

The new value of `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

Given:
- `dp[i - 1]` is `dp[3]` which is 17
- `dp[i - 2]` is `dp[2]` which is 3
- `i` is 4

Substituting these values into the formula:
`dp[4] = (17 + (4 - 1) * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[4] = (17 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[4] = (17 + 18) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[4] = 35 % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[4] = 35`

Therefore, `dp[4]` is updated to 35.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0, `i` is 4, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), `m` is `n - num` and must be at least 3, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, the third element is 17, the fourth element is 35, and the rest are 0**.
