Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains n integers sorted in descending order where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000; `i` is `x-1` if `x` > 0, otherwise `i` is 0; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`; `ans1` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the array `a` minus the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` each multiplied by 2 plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.** 

In simpler terms: The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is calculated as `x-1` if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise it is 0. The variable `ans2` remains equal to `ans1`. The variable `ans1` is recalculated based on the specified conditions. The variable `ans` is set to the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
