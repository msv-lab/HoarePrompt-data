You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7 for each i.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and the loop has finished executing all test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. Here's why the program works as intended:

1. **Sorting the List**: The program first sorts the list of numbers. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together first, maximizing the sum of the minimums in each pair.

2. **Summing the Even Indices**: After sorting, the program sums the numbers at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This works because, after sorting, the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list, and by summing every second number starting from the first (index 0), we are effectively summing the minimums of the pairs.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n`, reads the list of `2n` integers, sorts the list, and then prints the sum of the minimums of the pairs.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, it handles all potential cases correctly. The program sorts the numbers and sums the minimums of the pairs, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score. There are no edge cases that the program does not handle, such as when all numbers are the same, when there are duplicate numbers, or when the numbers are in random order. The program will always output the correct maximum score for any valid input within the problem's constraints.
