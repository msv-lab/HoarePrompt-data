Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `t` and `n` must be such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the first element of `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`, and `q` equals `i + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `i`, `j`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
