To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to understand how the `result` list is constructed based on the initial state provided.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Initialization and Iteration:**
   - The loop has executed `n` times.
   - For each iteration, two values `x` and `y` are read from the input.
   - These values are used to compute several intermediate variables and ultimately determine an element of the `result` list.

2. **Intermediate Variables:**
   - `space_x` is assigned the value of `x`.
   - `space_y` is assigned the value of `y * 4`.
   - `total_space` is calculated as `space_y + space_x`.
   - `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

3. **Determine Result Element:**
   - If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the corresponding element in `result` is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - Otherwise, the element is calculated as `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where:
     - `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is divisible by 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not divisible by 15.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement joins the elements of the `result` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

### Final Output Description

Given the above steps, the `print` statement will output the elements of the `result` list, each on a new line. Each element in `result` is determined based on the values of `x` and `y` for each iteration, as described in the steps above.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` for each iteration are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of the elements in `result`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the calculations performed for each iteration.

Output: **Each element of the `result` list, where each element is determined by the values of `x` and `y` for each iteration as described in the initial state. Each element is printed on a new line.**
