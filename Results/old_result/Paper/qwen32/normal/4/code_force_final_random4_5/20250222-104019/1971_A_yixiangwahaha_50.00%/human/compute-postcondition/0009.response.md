The code appends the integer value of the first substring in `xylist` to the list `x`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` and the integer value of `xylist[0]`; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t`; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string by spaces; `i` is 9.**
