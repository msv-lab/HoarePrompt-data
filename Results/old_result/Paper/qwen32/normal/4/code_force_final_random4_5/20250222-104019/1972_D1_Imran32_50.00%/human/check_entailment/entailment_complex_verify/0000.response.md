### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Function Name and Parameters**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads `n` and `k` from the input, but the problem description mentions `n` and `m`. This inconsistency is a red flag, as the program is not correctly interpreting the input parameters.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program calculates `ans` and then iterates to add values based on a loop that does not relate to the problem's conditions.
   - The condition `ans += (n + i) // cnt` does not align with the problem's requirement to check pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic in the program does not involve any checks or calculations related to the gcd or the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case `(1, 1)`, the output should be `1` because the only pair \((1, 1)\) satisfies the condition. The program outputs `1` for this case, but this is a coincidence and not due to correct logic.
   - For the fourth test case `(10, 8)`, the program outputs `14`, which matches the expected output, but this is not due to the correct logic. The logic in the program does not match how these pairs are counted.

4. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations describe the program's behavior but do not provide any evidence that the logic is correct for the given problem.
   - The annotations state that `ans` is calculated as `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one, which is not related to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The provided logic does not correctly count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Let's consider a simple case:
- Input: `n = 2, m = 3`
- Expected Output: `3` (pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2))
- Program Output: `4` (which is incorrect)

This example further demonstrates that the program does not correctly implement the required logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
