The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of the `print` statement is not influenced by these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`.
2. The string `'Yes'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. There are no variables or expressions that need to be evaluated or substituted in the `print` statement.

Hence, the output will be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
