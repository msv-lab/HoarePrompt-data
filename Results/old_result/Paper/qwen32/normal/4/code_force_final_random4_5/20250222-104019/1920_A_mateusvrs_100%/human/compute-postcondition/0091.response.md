The code snippet provided only increments the value of the variable `tmp` by 1. None of the other variables (`bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `t`, `n`, `i`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the incremented value of `tmp`.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least 1 element, `t` is at least 1, `n` is the number of iterations, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `tmp` is incremented by 1.**
