Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles and rearranging them. The logic of the program is based on the following conditions:

1. **Both dimensions are odd**: If both `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle. This is because the resulting smaller rectangles would also have odd dimensions, and there is no way to combine two odd-sized rectangles into a different rectangle with integer sides. The program correctly handles this by printing 'NO'.

2. **One dimension is exactly twice the other**: If one dimension is exactly twice the other (e.g., `a = 2 * b` or `b = 2 * a`), cutting the rectangle along the longer side will result in two rectangles of dimensions `b x b`. These two smaller rectangles can only form the same original rectangle (rotated or not), so the program correctly prints 'NO'.

3. **All other cases**: For all other cases, Bob can form a different rectangle. This includes cases where both dimensions are even, or one dimension is even and the other is odd. In these cases, the program correctly prints 'YES'.

The execution summary aligns with the logic described in the problem statement, and the program handles all edge cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
