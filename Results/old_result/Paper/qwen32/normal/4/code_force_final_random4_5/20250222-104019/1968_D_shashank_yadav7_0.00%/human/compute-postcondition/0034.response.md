Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 2`, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k + 2))`, `s` is `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s-1`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or if statement is broken out of because `k` is 0.
