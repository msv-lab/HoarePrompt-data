The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` must be greater than 2, and since this condition was already met in the previous iteration, it remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3**
