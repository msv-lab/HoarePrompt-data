The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Given the initial state, `i` was `n - 2`. After the operation `i += 2`, the new value of `i` is `n - 2 + 2`, which simplifies to `n`. The values of `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `counter` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is `n`, `counter` is incremented by 1.**
