Postcondition: **`t` is `t`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, and `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value` if it exists at that index. If `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is 2; otherwise, `removed_count` is 1. `favorite_count` is the number of times `favorite_value` appears in the entire `sorted_a` list.**
