Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - (tot + a)`; `L` is a list with at least two elements, `a` is the second element of `L`; `pow` is 2; `m` is 1; `tot` is `tot + a` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `a`, `pow`, `m`, and `tot` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
