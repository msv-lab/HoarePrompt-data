Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 2 elements; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` is now set to `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged. `num` is the next element in the list `arr` to be processed.**
