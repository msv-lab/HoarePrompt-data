The code snippet sets the variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of other variables like `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, or `i`. Therefore, the only change is that `cur` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is the newly input string; `cnt` is 0; `cur` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
