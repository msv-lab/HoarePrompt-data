The code snippet appends a value to the list `r`. The value being appended is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).

Output State: **`tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive); `r` has a new element appended, which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.** 

In simpler terms, the list `r` now includes an additional element that represents the number of integers from `bx` to `ax` (inclusive) that are not present in `cx`.
