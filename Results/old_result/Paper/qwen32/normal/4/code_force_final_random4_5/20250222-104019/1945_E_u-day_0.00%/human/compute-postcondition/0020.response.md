The value of `high` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1; `low` is 0, `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2`, and `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`. The value at `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`.
