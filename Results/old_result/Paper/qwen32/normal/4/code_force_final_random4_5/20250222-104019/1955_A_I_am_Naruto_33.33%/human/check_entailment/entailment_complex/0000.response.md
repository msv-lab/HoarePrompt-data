### Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts given the price `a` for one yogurt and the price `b` for two yogurts under promotion.

1. **Single Yogurt Case (`n == 1`)**:
   - If `n` is 1, the only option is to buy one yogurt at the regular price `a`. The program correctly handles this by printing `a` when `n == 1`.

2. **Multiple Yogurts Case (`n > 1`)**:
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually at the regular price `a`.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This is the cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotion price `b`, and any remaining yogurt is bought individually at the regular price `a`.
   - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`. This logic ensures that the minimum cost is always chosen.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 2 // 2 + 5 * 2 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9`
  - Minimum cost is `9`.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 13 + 5 = 18`
  - Minimum cost is `15`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 3 // 2 + 5 * 3 % 2 = 16 + 5 = 21`
  - Minimum cost is `15`.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * 4 // 2 + 5 * 4 % 2 = 22 + 0 = 22`
  - Minimum cost is `20`.

The program's output matches the expected output for all test cases, indicating that it is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
