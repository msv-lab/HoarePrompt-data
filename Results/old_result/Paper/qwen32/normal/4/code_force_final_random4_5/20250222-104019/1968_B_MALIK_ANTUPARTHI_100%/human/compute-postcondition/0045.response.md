Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `k` is updated to `j + 1`. The current value of `k` is equal to `c` or the current value of `j` is equal to `b - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is either `c` or `j + 1` based on the given conditions. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
