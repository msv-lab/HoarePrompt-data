Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element. If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if (n-2) is even, and `ans` is 0 if (n-2) is odd.**
