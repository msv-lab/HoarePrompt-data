Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and contains tuples in the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, where `diff` is the maximum of `abs(i - b[0])` and `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `index` is either `0` or `m - 1` depending on whether `diff` is `abs(i - b[0])` or `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `max_heap` will contain tuples for each element in the list `a`, where each tuple includes the negative of the maximum difference between the element and the first or last element of the sorted list `b`, the element itself, and the index of the element in `b` that was used to calculate the difference. The other variables (`tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged except that `t` has been decremented by the number of elements in `a`.
