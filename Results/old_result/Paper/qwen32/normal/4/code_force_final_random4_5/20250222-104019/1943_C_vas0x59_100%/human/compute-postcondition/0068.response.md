The code snippet appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. This means that the list `ops` will now contain six elements, with the new tuple added to the end. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` inclusive, where the last vertex in the list is `a` and `previous[a]` is `-1`; `ops` is a list containing six elements `[(c1, i), (c2, i), (c1, i + 2), (c2, i), (c1, i + 4), (c2, i)]`; the length of `path_ba` is greater than 2; `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is the integer value of `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`; `i` is `i + 4`.**
