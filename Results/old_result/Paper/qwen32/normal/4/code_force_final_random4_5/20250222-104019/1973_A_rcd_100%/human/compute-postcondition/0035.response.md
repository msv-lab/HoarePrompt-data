The given Python code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state specifies that `t` is at least 0, and `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers satisfying the conditions 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, with their sum being odd. Additionally, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, this condition holds after the assignment.

The code provided does not modify the initial conditions but only assigns new values to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` based on the input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values read from the input while maintaining the preconditions as much as possible.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and they hold the values read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the current value of `p3` remains greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, `p3` retains its original value.**

In simpler terms: `t` remains at least 0, and the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are updated to the integers read from the input, maintaining the conditions that their sum is odd and if `p3` is initially greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, this condition holds.
