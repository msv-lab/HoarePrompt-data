Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value of `v1` is assigned the value of `v2`. Since `v2` is equal to `i`, `v1` will also be equal to `i`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `v2` is equal to `i`, `r` is the user input, `v1` is equal to `i`**.
