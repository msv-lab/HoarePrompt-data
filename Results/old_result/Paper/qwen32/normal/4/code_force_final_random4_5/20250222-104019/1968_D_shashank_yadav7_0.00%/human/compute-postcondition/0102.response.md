Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n-1, initial_k - 1)`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is `max(0, initial_k - i - 1)`, `b` is updated `i` times based on `p`, `s` is updated `i` times based on `p`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s] * (i + 1)`, `bp` is `a[b] * (i + 1) - 1`, `sm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated expression for each iteration, `bm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated expression for each iteration, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` remains greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is equal to `sm`.**
