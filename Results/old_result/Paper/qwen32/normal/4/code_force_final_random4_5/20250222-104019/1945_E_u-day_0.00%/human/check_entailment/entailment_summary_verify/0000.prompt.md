You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function determines the position of a specified integer `k` in a permutation list `arr` of length `n`. It prints `0` if `k` is found at the position indicated by a binary search's lower bound index. If `k` is not found at that position, it prints `1` followed by the 1-based indices of the lower bound and the first occurrence of `k` in the list.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. Specifically, it does not guarantee that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Here are a few potential issues and counterexamples:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**: The code attempts to perform at most one swap if the binary search does not find `x` at the correct position. However, it does not consider the possibility of performing a second swap to correct the order.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is flawed. The code only performs a single swap if the initial binary search does not find `x` at the correct position. It does not ensure that after the swap, the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.

3. **Counterexample**: Consider the following test case:
    ```
    1
    5 3
    5 4 3 2 1
    ```
    - The initial binary search will not find `3` at the correct position because the array is sorted in descending order.
    - The code will perform a single swap, but it may not be sufficient to place `3` in the correct position for the binary search to find it.

Let's consider a specific case:
- For the input `n = 5`, `x = 3` and the permutation `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the binary search will start with `l = 0` and `r = 5`.
- The first iteration will set `m = 2` and find `arr[2] = 3`, but the binary search will not terminate correctly because the array is not sorted.
- The code will perform a swap, but it may not place `3` in the correct position for the binary search to find it.

Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description, and there are potential cases where the program does not work as expected. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
