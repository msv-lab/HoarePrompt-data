Given the initial state, `curr` is updated by the code snippet `curr = n // i`. Since `i` is `1`, the new value of `curr` will be `n // 1`, which is simply `n`.

Output State: **`n` is `-n`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}, `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is `curr`, `curr` is `n`, `i` is `1`**

In natural language, the value of `curr` has been updated to `n`. All other variables retain their initial values.
