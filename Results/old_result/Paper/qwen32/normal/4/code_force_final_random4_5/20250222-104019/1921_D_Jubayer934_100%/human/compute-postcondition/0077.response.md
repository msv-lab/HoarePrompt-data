The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. This means that the list `ans` will now contain one more element, which is the absolute difference calculated. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only change is to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is either -1 or `i` depending on the condition, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order.**
