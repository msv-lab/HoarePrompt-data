Reasoning:

The provided program contains a logical error in the implementation of the `func_1` function. The function aims to determine how many ships are sunk after `k` attacks by the Kraken. The logic in the function, however, does not correctly simulate the attack pattern and the sinking of ships.

Here are the key issues with the current implementation:

1. The variables `s_a` and `s_b` are being used to accumulate the total durability of the ships, which is not the intended use. Instead, `s_a` and `s_b` should be used to keep track of the cumulative durability of the ships attacked from the start and the end, respectively, up to the point where the cumulative durability exceeds `a` and `b`.

2. The condition checks `if s_a <= a` and `if s_b <= b` are incorrect for determining the number of ships sunk. These conditions do not correctly reflect the attack pattern and the sinking of ships.

3. The function does not correctly simulate the alternating attack pattern (first ship, last ship, first ship, etc.) and does not account for the fact that ships that have sunk are no longer attacked.

Given the above issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
