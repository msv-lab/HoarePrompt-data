The value of `tp1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is `tp1 + 1`, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with the largest `diff` removed, `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, j)` that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1 - 1])`, `item[2]` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, and `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.
