Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 <= `T` <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for each i. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `T` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`) remain unchanged.
