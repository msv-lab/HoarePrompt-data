Let's analyze the given `try` and `except` block step by step:

The `try` block attempts to execute the following operations:
1. Decrement the value at index `g` in the list `a` by 1.
2. Decrement the value at index `d` in the list `a` by 1.
3. If the value at index `g` becomes 0 after decrementing, increment `g` by 1.
4. If the value at index `d` becomes 0 after decrementing, decrement `d` by 1.

An exception could occur at any of the operations within the `try` block, particularly if:
- `a[g]` or `a[d]` is not an integer (which would cause a `ValueError` when trying to convert it to an integer).
- `g` or `d` is out of bounds for the list `a` (which would cause an `IndexError`).

If an exception occurs, the `except` block will execute, which simply breaks out of the most internal loop or `if` statement, and the state of the program becomes unknown.

Now, let's summarize the program's state after the `try` statement executes successfully and if an exception occurs:

**Successful Execution:**
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `n` and `k` retain their initial values.
- The value at index `g` in the list `a` is decremented by 1.
- The value at index `d` in the list `a` is decremented by 1.
- If the value at index `g` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1.
- If the value at index `d` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

**Exception Occurrence:**
- The state of the program becomes unknown.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or `if` statement.

Combining these scenarios, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` retain their initial values; `a` is a list of integers where the first non-zero element `a[g]` is `a[g] - 1`, and the last element is `a[d] - 1` if `a[d]` was not 0, otherwise `a[d]` is -1; `d` is equal to `len(a) - 2` if `a[d]` was 0, otherwise `d` is equal to `len(a) - 1`; `g` is 1 if `a[0]` is 0, otherwise `g` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`. If an exception occurs, the state is unknown, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
