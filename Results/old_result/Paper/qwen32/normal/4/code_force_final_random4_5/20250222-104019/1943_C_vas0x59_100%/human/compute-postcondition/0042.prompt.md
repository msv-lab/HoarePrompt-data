Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, previous[b]]`; `n` is `previous[b]`. If `n` is equal to -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, previous[b], n]`; `n` is `previous[b]`. If `n` is `-1`, the program remains in the same state with no further changes.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `[b, previous[b], n, n]`. If `n` is `-1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
