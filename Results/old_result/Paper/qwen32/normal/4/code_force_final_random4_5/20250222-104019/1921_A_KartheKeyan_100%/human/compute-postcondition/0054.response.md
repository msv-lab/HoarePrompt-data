The code snippet modifies the value of `p1` by calculating the squared Euclidean distance between the first two points in the `coord` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `n` must be at least 2, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is `0`, `i` is `3`, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, `p2` is `(x4 - x3)`**

In simpler terms, `p1` now holds the value of the squared distance between the first two points in the sorted `coord` list, while all other variables retain their initial values.
