The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 4999\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since the state of `n` and `A` does not affect whether the loop can execute, we do not need to adjust them.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers**
