To determine the output of the `print(x, y)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. This variable is not directly used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.
2. **x**: The first integer from the new input. The exact value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, so we can only refer to it as `x`.
3. **y**: The second integer from the new input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9. The exact value of `y` is not specified in the initial state, so we can only refer to it as `y`.
4. **i**: Incremented by 1. The value of `i` is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.

Given the above, the `print(x, y)` statement will output the values of `x` and `y` as they are provided in the new input.

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the new input and y is the second integer from the new input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9)**
