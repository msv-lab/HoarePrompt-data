Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the array.
- We will perform a binary search to find `x` such that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the swaps.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The code consists of three functions:
1. `func_1()`: Reads a line of input and returns a map of integers.
2. `func_2()`: Converts the map of integers from `func_1()` into a list.
3. `func_3()`: Implements the main logic to find `x` in the permutation with at most 2 swaps and prints the necessary operations.

### Function Summary Recap:
The function summary for `func_3()` states that it determines the position of `x` in the permutation list and prints `0` if `x` is found at the position indicated by the binary search's lower bound index. If not, it prints `1` followed by the 1-based indices of the lower bound and the first occurrence of `x`.

### Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in the provided code is flawed. The binary search does not terminate correctly if the array is not sorted.
2. **Handling of Swaps**: The code only performs at most one swap if the initial binary search does not find `x` at the correct position. It does not consider the possibility of performing a second swap to correct the order.
3. **Counterexample**: Consider the test case:
    ```
    1
    5 3
    5 4 3 2 1
    ```
    - The binary search will not find `3` at the correct position because the array is sorted in descending order.
    - The code will perform a single swap, but it may not be sufficient to place `3` in the correct position for the binary search to find it.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The code does not guarantee that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.
- The binary search logic assumes the array is sorted, which is not the case here.
- The provided code does not handle the requirement of performing at most 2 swaps correctly to ensure `x` is found at the correct position after the binary search.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. There are potential cases where the program does not work as expected, and the binary search logic does not account for the unsorted nature of the permutation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
