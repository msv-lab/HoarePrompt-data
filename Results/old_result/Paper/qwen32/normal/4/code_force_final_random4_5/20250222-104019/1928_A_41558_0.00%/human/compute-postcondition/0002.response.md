The code provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer within a specific range, and `a` and `b` are integers also within specific ranges. However, the code snippet overrides the values of `a` and `b` with the values read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 0.**
