The task is to determine what will be printed by the `print(1)` statement given the initial state of the variables `n` and `k`.

Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
print(1)
```

Explanation:
- The `print(1)` statement directly prints the integer `1`.
- The values of `n` and `k` are not used in this print statement, so their specific values do not affect the output.

Output: **1**
