The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Given the initial state where `i` is `n - 2`, after the increment, `i` becomes `n`.

Other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `counter`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is `n`, `counter` is incremented by 1.**
