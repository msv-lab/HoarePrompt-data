The code snippet provided increments `s_a` by `nums[i]`. This means the value of `s_a` will change, but the values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `s_b`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged based on the information provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `s_a` is `nums[i] + nums[i]`; `s_b` is `nums[n - i - 1]`. If `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, `ans` is incremented by 1; `i` is `i + 1`.**
