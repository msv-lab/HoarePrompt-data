Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `x` is the first integer from the new input.
- `y` is the second integer from the new input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.
- `i` is `i + 1` (Note: The value of `i` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output).

### Print Statement:
```
print(y, x)
```

### Analysis:
- `y` is explicitly defined as the second integer from the new input, and it is known that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.
- `x` is explicitly defined as the first integer from the new input, but its exact value is not specified in the precondition.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the precondition, we will describe the output in terms of `x` and `y`.

### Explanation:
The print statement will output the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`.

### Output:
Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the new input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, and x is the first integer from the new input)**
