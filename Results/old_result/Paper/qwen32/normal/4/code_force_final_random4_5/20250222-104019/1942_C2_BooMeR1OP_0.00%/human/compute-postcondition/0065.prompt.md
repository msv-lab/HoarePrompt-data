Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive gaps calculated as `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0) - a[i] - 1` for each `i` in the range `[0, x-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for gap in gaps:
    pairs = gap // 2
    if y >= pairs:
        ans += gap
        y -= pairs
    else:
        ans += 2 * y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is `x - 2 + gap` if `y` is greater than or equal to `gap // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2 + 2 * y` and `y` is less than `gap // 2`. In both cases, `gaps` remains a sorted list of all positive gaps and `pairs` remains `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is calculated based on the value of `y` relative to `pairs` (`gap // 2`). If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, then `ans` is `x - 2 + 2 * gap` if `y - pairs` is greater than or equal to `pairs`; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2 + gap + 2 * (y - pairs)`. If `y` is less than `pairs`, then `ans` is `x - 2 + 4 * y` if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2 + gap + 2 * y`. `gaps` remains a sorted list of all positive gaps with at least one more element, `pairs` is `gap // 2`, and `gap` is the next element in the `gaps` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is calculated based on the value of `y` relative to `pairs` (`gap // 2`). If `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`, then `ans` is `x - 2 + 2 * gap` if `y - pairs` is greater than or equal to `pairs`; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2 + gap + 2 * (y - pairs)`. If `y` is less than `pairs`, then `ans` is `x - 2 + 4 * y` if `y` is greater than or equal to `pairs`; otherwise, `ans` is `x - 2 + gap + 2 * y`. If `y` was initially greater than or equal to `pairs`, `y` is updated to `y - (gap // 2)`. If `y` was less than `pairs`, `ans` is adjusted by adding `2 * y` to it. `gaps` remains a sorted list of all positive gaps with at least one more element, `pairs` is `gap // 2`, and `gap` is the next element in the `gaps` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
