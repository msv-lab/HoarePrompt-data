The loop head in the provided `for` loop is:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a conventional throwaway variable in Python used when the loop variable is not needed), and `t` is the range over which the loop iterates. Since `_` is not relevant to the state, the only variable that can be adjusted is `t`.

Given that `t` represents the number of remaining test cases, at the start of each new iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 because one test case has just been processed.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases).
2. **Adjustment**: Since one iteration of the loop has just completed, we need to decrement `t` by 1 to reflect that one test case has been processed.
3. **Output State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases) - 1**.

Since we are decrementing `t` by 1, the new state should reflect this decrement. Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 < `t` ≤ number of test cases) - 1**.

To be more precise and clear, if `t` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `k - 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases) - 1**.

For simplicity and clarity in the context of the loop head:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`**.
