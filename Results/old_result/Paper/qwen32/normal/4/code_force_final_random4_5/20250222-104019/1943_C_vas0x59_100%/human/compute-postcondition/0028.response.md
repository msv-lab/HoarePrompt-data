Postcondition: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`; `n` is `previous[b]` and `n` is equal to -1.**
