To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. 

Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `i` is 3.
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.

From the loop definition, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

Here is the adjusted state:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**.
