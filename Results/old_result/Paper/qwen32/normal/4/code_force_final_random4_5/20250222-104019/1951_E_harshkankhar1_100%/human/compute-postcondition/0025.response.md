Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is either the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`, or `-1` if no such character exists, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. Additionally, `x` is not equal to `-1`, meaning there is at least one character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`.**
