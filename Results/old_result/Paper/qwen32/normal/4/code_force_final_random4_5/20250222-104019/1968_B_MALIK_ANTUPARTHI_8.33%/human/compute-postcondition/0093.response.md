The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement `for j in range(b)`, `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, for the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1` or equivalently `(i + 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `i + 3`.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we only need to adjust `j`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the new input string, `j` is `i + 3`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without any changes to the variables. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Since the task specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we only need to update `j`:

State: **`j` is `i + 3`** (or simply `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value)

Given the context, a more precise and minimal adjustment would be:

State: **`j` is `j + 1`**
