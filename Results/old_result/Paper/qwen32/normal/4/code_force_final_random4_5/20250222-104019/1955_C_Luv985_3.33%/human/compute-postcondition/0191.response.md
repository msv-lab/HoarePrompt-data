The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `1 - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[1]` is `a[1] - mi`, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, `T` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[1])`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is `1 - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[1]` is `a[1] - mi`, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, `T` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[1])`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
