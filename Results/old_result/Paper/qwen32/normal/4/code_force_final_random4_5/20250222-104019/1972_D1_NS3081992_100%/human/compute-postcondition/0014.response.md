Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. It calculates the sum of the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` from 1 up to, but not including, `i_final`. Here, `i_final` is the smallest integer that is either greater than `m` or satisfies `i * i > n + i`. The function returns this sum minus one.**
