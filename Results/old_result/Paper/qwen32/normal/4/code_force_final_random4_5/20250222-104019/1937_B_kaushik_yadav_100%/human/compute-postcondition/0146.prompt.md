Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is the final constructed string based on the conditions described; `i` equals the length of `a`; `work` is True or False depending on the last iteration; `j` maintains its respective state as described in the precondition; `counter` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the conditions described, `i` equals the length of `a`, `work` is True or False depending on the last iteration, `j` is 0. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is 1, and either `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', or `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the conditions described, `i` equals the length of `a`, `work` is True or False depending on the last iteration, `j` is 0. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 3. Otherwise, `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', and `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the conditions described, `i` equals the length of `a`, `work` is True or False depending on the last iteration, `j` is `len(a) - 1`. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, `counter` is incremented by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
