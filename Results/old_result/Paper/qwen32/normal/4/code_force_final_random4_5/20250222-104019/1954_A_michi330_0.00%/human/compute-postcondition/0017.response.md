Postcondition: **`t` is at least 2, `itest` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer. The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is evaluated based on the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. If the condition is true, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes that the values of the variables `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same regardless of whether the if or else part is executed, as the postconditions of both parts are identical to the original precondition.
