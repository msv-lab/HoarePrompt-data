The provided code snippet only includes `n = int(input())`, which reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state (`bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `t`, `r`, `tmp`).

Therefore, the only change is that `n` now holds the value of the input integer. All other variables retain their initial states and conditions.

Output State: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` is at least 1, `n` is the input integer, and `r` contains elements as per its initial condition or previous updates.**
