The code snippet `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element at index `j` of list `a` from the list `todo`. This means that the list `todo` will no longer contain the element `a[j]`. The values of `done`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions. The value of `j` has already been incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, so it is now `j + 1`.

Output State: **`done`, `extra`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are defined as per the initial conditions; `j` is `j + 1`; `todo` no longer contains the element `a[j]`.**
