The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements: the original input string and the new input string, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the first string in `a` and the first character of the second string in `a`, `last_row` is the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the last string in `a`, `i` is 2**
