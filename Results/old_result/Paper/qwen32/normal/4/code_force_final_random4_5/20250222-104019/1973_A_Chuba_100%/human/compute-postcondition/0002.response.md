The code snippet assigns the variable `v` to a list of integers obtained from the input. The input is expected to be a string of space-separated integers, which are then converted to integers and stored in the list `v`. The values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
