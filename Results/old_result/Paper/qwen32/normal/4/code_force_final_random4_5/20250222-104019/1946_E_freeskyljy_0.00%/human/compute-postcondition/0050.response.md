The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Based on the initial state, `i` is either `R[0] + 1` or `R[cur]`. After the increment, `i` will be `R[0] + 2` if it was `R[0] + 1`, or `R[cur] + 1` if it was `R[cur]`. The value of `cur` and `ans` remain unchanged unless `i` was equal to `R[cur]` and then `cur` was 2, in which case `ans` would have been modified, but since the increment operation does not change `cur` or `ans` directly, we only update `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -2; `M2` is greater than 1; `cur` is either 1 or 2; `i` is either `R[0] + 2` or `R[cur] + 1`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 2. If `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 1 and `ans` is `ans * (-1) % MOD`.**
