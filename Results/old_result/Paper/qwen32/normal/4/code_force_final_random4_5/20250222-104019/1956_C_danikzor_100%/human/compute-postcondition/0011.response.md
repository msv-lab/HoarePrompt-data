The loop iterates `n` times for each test case, starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n`. For each iteration, the loop prints two lines. The first line prints `1`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then a decreasing sequence from `n` to `1`. The second line prints `2`, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the same decreasing sequence from `n` to `1`.

Given that the loop runs `n` times, the final iteration will be when `i = n`. Therefore, the output state after all iterations will be the state where `i` has reached `n + 1` (since the loop condition `i <= n` will be false at this point, and the loop will terminate).

Output State: **i = n + 1**, and the loop will have printed `2 * n` lines, each pair of lines corresponding to a value of `i` from `1` to `n`.

In simpler terms, after all the iterations are complete, the loop variable `i` will be `n + 1`, and the program will have printed two lines for each value of `i` from `1` to `n`.
