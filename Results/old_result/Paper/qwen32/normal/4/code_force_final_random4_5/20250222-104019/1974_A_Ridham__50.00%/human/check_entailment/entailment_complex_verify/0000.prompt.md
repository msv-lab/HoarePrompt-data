You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: The loop has executed `n` times, and `result` is a list containing `n` elements. Each element in `result` is determined by the values of `x` and `y` read from input for each iteration. Specifically, for each iteration, `space_x` is equal to `x`, and `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`. The variable `total_space` holds the sum `space_y + space_x`. The variable `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd. The variable `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, the corresponding element in `result` is `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, the corresponding element in `result` is calculated as `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_screen` is `space_x // 15` if `space_x` is divisible by 15, or `space_x // 15 + 1` if `space_x` is not divisible by 15.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers `x` and `y`. For each test case, it calculates and returns the number of screens required based on the given values of `x` and `y`. The result for each test case is printed on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Analysis of the Program

The program aims to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. The logic used in the program is as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`.
2. **Space Calculation**: It calculates the total space required for 1x1 icons (`space_x`) and 2x2 icons (`space_y`).
3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
    - If `y` is even, it calculates the number of screens required as `y // 2`.
    - If `y` is odd, it calculates the number of screens required as `y // 2 + 1`.
4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: It calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons on the screens.
5. **Extra Screen Calculation**:
    - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, it appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result.
    - Otherwise, it calculates the extra screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds this to the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.

### Potential Issues

Let's consider a few edge cases to see if the program handles them correctly:

1. **Case 1**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`
   - The program should return `0` screens.
   - The program correctly returns `0` screens.

2. **Case 2**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - The program should return `1` screen.
   - The program correctly returns `1` screen.

3. **Case 3**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
   - The program should return `1` screen.
   - The program correctly returns `1` screen.

4. **Case 4**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
   - The program should return `2` screens.
   - The program correctly returns `2` screens.

5. **Case 5**: `x = 0`, `y = 3`
   - The program should return `2` screens.
   - The program correctly returns `2` screens.

6. **Case 6**: `x = 15`, `y = 0`
   - The program should return `1` screen.
   - The program correctly returns `1` screen.

7. **Case 7**: `x = 0`, `y = 9`
   - The program should return `5` screens.
   - The program correctly returns `5` screens.

8. **Case 8**: `x = 8`, `y = 2`
   - The program should return `2` screens.
   - The program correctly returns `2` screens.

### Testing with Edge Cases

Let's consider a more complex case:

- **Case 9**: `x = 14`, `y = 2`
  - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons as `2 // 2 = 1`.
  - The remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons are `15 * 1 - 8 = 7`.
  - Since `14` 1x1 icons cannot fit in the remaining `7` cells, it calculates the extra screens required for the remaining `14 - 7 = 7` 1x1 icons.
  - The extra screens required are `7 // 15 + 1 = 1`.
  - The total screens required are `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - The program correctly returns `2` screens.

### Conclusion

After testing the program with various edge cases, it appears to handle the problem requirements correctly. Therefore, the program seems to meet the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons in all tested cases.
