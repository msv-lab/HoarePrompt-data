Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where `n` is the number of parts of the ribbon, `m` is the number of colors available, and `k` is the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint. For each test case, the function returns a value indicating the result based on these parameters.**
