The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `result`. No other variables are modified or assigned new values. Therefore, the initial state of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99; `n` is an input integer; `result` is an empty list.**
