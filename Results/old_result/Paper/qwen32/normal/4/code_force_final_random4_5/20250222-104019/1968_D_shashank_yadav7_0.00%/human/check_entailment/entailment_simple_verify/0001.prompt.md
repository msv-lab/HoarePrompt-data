You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are positive integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The permutation p is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.

    #State: After all iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `a`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are updated based on the input for each iteration, and the result of each comparison between `bm` and `sm` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Understanding

The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation array. On each turn, both players:
1. Increase their score by the value at their current position in the array `a`.
2. Optionally move to the position indicated by the current position in the permutation array `p`.

After `k` turns, the player with the higher score wins. If the scores are equal, the game is a draw.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the input for multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads `n`, `k`, `b` (Bodya's starting position), and `s` (Sasha's starting position).
2. Reads the permutation array `p`.
3. Reads the score array `a`.
4. Initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha.
5. Simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores accordingly.
6. Compares the final scores and prints the winner.

Let's examine the logic in more detail:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions are adjusted to be zero-indexed.
   - Initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the value at their starting positions in `a`.
   - `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `bp * k` and `sp * k` respectively, which seems incorrect for the simulation logic. These variables should be initialized to `bp` and `sp`.

2. **Simulation Loop**:
   - The loop runs for `k` turns. However, the loop logic is flawed:
     - `k -= 1` decreases `k` before the loop body executes, so the loop will execute `k-1` times.
     - Inside the loop, `b` and `s` are updated to their next positions in the permutation array.
     - The score updates (`bm` and `sm`) are incorrect. The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` does not correctly simulate the game. It should simply add `a[b]` to `bm` and `a[s]` to `sm` for each turn.
     - The lines `sp += a[s]` and `bp += a[b]` are unnecessary since the scores are already updated in the previous step.

3. **Comparison**:
   - After the loop, the program correctly compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect due to the flawed initialization and simulation logic. Specifically:
- The initializations of `bm` and `sm` should be `bp` and `sp` instead of `bp * k` and `sp * k`.
- The loop should execute `k` times, not `k-1` times.
- The score updates inside the loop are incorrect.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
