The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `counter`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for the current `i` is still valid, but now it applies to the new value of `i`. The condition `i` is less than `n - 1` also remains valid and should be checked with the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for the current `i`, `i` is less than `n - 1`, and `counter` is increased by 1.**
