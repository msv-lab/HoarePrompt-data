Output State: **`tests` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a non-empty iterable with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `slength` is the integer value provided by the input, `no` is False, `x` is the third element of `c`**

Explanation: The value of `no` has been explicitly set to `False` by the code. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
