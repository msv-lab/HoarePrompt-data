The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's condition. The loop's condition is determined by the value of `int(input())`, which is not a variable in the provided state but rather a new input value that will be read each time the loop iterates.

Given that the loop head does not contain any variables from the provided state that need adjustment, the state of `t`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged. However, for the loop to execute one more time, the next input value read by `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

Since the task specifies adjusting only the states of objects in the loop head, and there are no such objects to adjust in this case, the state of the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remains as is.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `k` was 1, it remains 1; otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The current value of `k` satisfies either `k <= 2 * n` or `k > 2 * n`.**
