Postcondition: **`ver` is the leftmost element that was removed from `q`, `graph[ver]` contains at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[ver]`. If `node` was not visited (`vis[node]` was 0), then `q` now contains `node` as an additional element and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `q` and `vis[node]` remain unchanged.**
