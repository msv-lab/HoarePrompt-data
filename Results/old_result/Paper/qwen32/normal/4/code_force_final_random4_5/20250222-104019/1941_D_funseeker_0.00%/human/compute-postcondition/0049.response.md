The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` will split the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts and assign the first part to `r` and the second part to `c`. The previous values of `r` and `c` are overwritten by these new values. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `temp`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m-2` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`. `ans` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
