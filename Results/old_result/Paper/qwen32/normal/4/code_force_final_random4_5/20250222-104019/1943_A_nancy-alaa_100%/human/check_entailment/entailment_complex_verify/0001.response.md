### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated version to determine its correctness based on the problem description and optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

#### Problem Analysis:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to determine the final score of the game, which is the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed.
2. **Players' Actions**:
   - Alice appends an element from `a` to `c` and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes an element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
4. **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Program Analysis:

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
2. Uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
3. Iterates over the range `[0, n]` to find the smallest integer not in `arr` or the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first such integer has been encountered.

#### Issues in the Program:

The provided program does not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy. Instead, it attempts to find the MEX based on the counts of elements in the initial array `arr`. This approach does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob and their respective strategies to maximize or minimize the MEX.

The key insight is that the MEX of the final array `c` depends on the parity (even or odd) of the counts of each number in `arr`:
- If a number appears an odd number of times in `arr`, it will end up in `c` because Bob can only remove pairs.
- If a number appears an even number of times in `arr`, it will not end up in `c` because Bob can remove all instances of that number.

Therefore, the correct approach is to find the smallest non-negative integer that appears an odd number of times in `arr`.

#### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy and does not compute the correct MEX for each test case. The program incorrectly finds the smallest integer not in `arr` or the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first such integer, which does not align with the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
