To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior based on the given information. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is greater than 0.
   - `b` is the last string input by the user.
   - `k` is an empty list.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not involved in the provided loop code, it's mentioned in the initial state).

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       b = input()
       if '1' in b:
           k.append(b.count('1'))
   ```
   - The loop runs for a number of times equal to the integer input by the user.
   - In each iteration, a new string `b` is input by the user.
   - If the string `b` contains the character '1', the count of '1's in `b` is appended to the list `k`.

3. **Output States after Iterations:**
   - **After 1 iteration:** `b` is updated to the new string input. If '1' is in `b`, `k` has one element (the count of '1's in `b`).
   - **After 2 iterations:** `b` is updated to the new string input. If '1' is in `b`, `k` has an additional element (the count of '1's in `b`).
   - **After 3 iterations:** `b` is updated to the new string input. If '1' is in `b`, `k` has an additional element (the count of '1's in `b`).

4. **Final Output State:**
   - The loop runs for a total number of times specified by the initial integer input.
   - After all iterations, `b` will be the last string input by the user.
   - `k` will contain the counts of '1's from each string `b` that contained '1' during the loop iterations.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`b` is the last string input by the user, and `k` is a list containing the counts of '1's from each string `b` that contained '1' during the loop iterations.**
