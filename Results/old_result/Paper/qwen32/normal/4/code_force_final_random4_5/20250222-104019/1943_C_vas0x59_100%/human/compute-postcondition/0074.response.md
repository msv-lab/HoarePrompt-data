Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts parameters `u2vs`, `n`, `u`, and `v`. `u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. `u` and `v` are integers representing the vertices connected by an edge such that 0 <= u, v < n. The function returns `None`.**
