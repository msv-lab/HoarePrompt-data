The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`. Given the initial state, the value of `cnt` will either remain the same or increase by 1 depending on the characters at position `i` in strings `s` and `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`, `cnt` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` plus 1 if `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `cnt` has been updated to reflect whether the characters at position `i` in `s` and `t` were different. The other variables remain unchanged.
