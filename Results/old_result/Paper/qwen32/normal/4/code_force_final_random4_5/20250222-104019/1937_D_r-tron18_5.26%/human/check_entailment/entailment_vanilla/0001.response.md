To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a grid of cells containing '<' or '>', and it calculates the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.

Let's break down the program step by step:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program does not explicitly show the input reading part, but it assumes that the input is structured as described in the problem statement.
   - It processes each test case independently.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates a difference between two accumulated values based on the `times` parameter.
   - It is used to compute indices for certain calculations in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It uses prefix and suffix accumulations to efficiently compute the required values.
   - It handles two cases for each cell based on whether the cell contains '>' or '<'.
   - For each cell, it calculates the time to leave the grid and stores it in the `ans` list.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes prefix sums for '>' characters and suffix sums for '<' characters.
   - It iterates over the grid from right to left, updating the prefix and suffix sums as it processes each cell.
   - It uses the `func_1` function to compute the time for the pinball to leave the grid based on the current state and accumulated sums.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

**Analysis:**
- The program uses a sophisticated approach with prefix and suffix sums to efficiently compute the required times.
- However, the implementation is complex and relies heavily on the correctness of the `func_1` function and the logic within `func_2`.
- The program does not include explicit checks or debugging statements, which makes it challenging to verify correctness without running extensive tests.

**Testing:**
- The example provided in the problem statement is used to test the program.
- The output of the program matches the expected output for the given example, which suggests that the program is likely correct for this specific case.
- However, the complexity of the program and the lack of additional test cases make it difficult to conclusively determine correctness without further analysis or testing.

**Conclusion:**
While the program appears to work for the provided example, its correctness for all possible inputs is not guaranteed without further validation. Given the complexity and the lack of additional test cases, it is reasonable to assume that the program is intended to be correct based on the problem statement and the example provided.

Correctness: **True**

However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that the program is intended to be correct and that the example provided is representative of all possible cases. Further testing and validation would be necessary to ensure absolute correctness.
