Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variable `t`**: This is a string representing the input value. The exact value of `t` is not specified, but we know it contains at least two substrings separated by a space.

2. **Variable `x`**: This is a list that contains the integer value of the first substring of `t` repeated ten times. For example, if `t` is "5 10", then `x` would be `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.

3. **Variable `y`**: This is a list that contains the integer value of the second substring of `t` repeated ten times. Using the same example, if `t` is "5 10", then `y` would be `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`.

4. **Variable `xylist`**: This is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the string `t` by spaces. So, if `t` is "5 10", then `xylist` would be `['5', '10']`.

5. **Variable `i`**: This is set to the value 2.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
```
Given that `i` is 2, the statement will print the third element (since list indices start at 0) of `x` and `y`.

Since `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` repeated ten times, and `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` repeated ten times, the third elements of `x` and `y` will be the same as the first and second substrings of `t` respectively, converted to integers.

Let's denote the first substring of `t` as `first_substring` and the second substring of `t` as `second_substring`. Therefore:
- `x[i]` (which is `x[2]`) will be `int(first_substring)`.
- `y[i]` (which is `y[2]`) will be `int(second_substring)`.

Thus, the output will be the integer value of the first substring of `t` followed by a space and then the integer value of the second substring of `t`.

Output: **int(first_substring) int(second_substring) (where first_substring and second_substring are the substrings of the input string `t` split by a space)**
