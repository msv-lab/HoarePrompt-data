The code snippet `nums = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `nums`. This means that `nums` will now contain the input values as strings. The values of `n`, `t`, the tree edges, the starting node `u_1`, and the `numbers` list are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone, `numbers` is a list containing two elements, which are lists `[num1, num2]` and `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the input values.**
