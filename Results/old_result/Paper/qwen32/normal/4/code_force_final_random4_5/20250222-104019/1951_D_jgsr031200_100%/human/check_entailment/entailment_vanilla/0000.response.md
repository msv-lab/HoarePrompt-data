Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Bob needs to set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The number of stalls `s` must be at most 60.
   - The price per jewel at each stall must be an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
   - Alice does not need to spend all her coins.
3. **Approach**:
   - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly one jewel for one coin at one stall.
   - If `n < k`, it's impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels.
   - Otherwise, the program attempts to set up stalls with specific prices and checks if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Case 1**: If `n == k`, the program correctly outputs "YES" and sets up one stall with a price of 1.
   - **Case 2**: If `n < k`, the program correctly outputs "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels.
   - **Case 3**: If `n > k`, the program initializes a list `costs` with two prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then attempts to calculate how many jewels Alice can buy with these prices.
3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program only considers two prices `[n - k + 1, 1]` and tries to calculate the number of jewels Alice can buy with these prices. This is insufficient to guarantee that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The program does not attempt to set up multiple stalls with different prices to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The logic for calculating how many jewels Alice can buy with the given prices is incorrect and does not account for the possibility of setting up more than two stalls.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, Bob can set up stalls with prices that allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. One possible approach is to use binary representation of `k` to determine the number of stalls and their prices. For example, if `k` is 8, Bob can set up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]` and Alice will buy exactly 8 jewels.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It only considers two stalls and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
