The code snippet provided updates the value of `rem` by calculating the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. The current value of `i` satisfies the condition that ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k)**

In simpler terms, the value of `rem` has been updated to `k % (i + 1)`, while all other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
