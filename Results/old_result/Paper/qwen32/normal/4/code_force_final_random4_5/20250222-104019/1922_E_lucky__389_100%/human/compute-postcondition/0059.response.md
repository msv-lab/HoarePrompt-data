The code snippet appends the value of `subseq_lens[i]` to the list `ansv`. The values of `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and the initial elements of `ansv` remain unchanged. The only change is that `ansv` now includes an additional element, which is `subseq_lens[i]`.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` must have at least 2 elements, `mx` is the maximum value of these exponents (decremented by 1), `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and an additional element `subseq_lens[i]`.**
