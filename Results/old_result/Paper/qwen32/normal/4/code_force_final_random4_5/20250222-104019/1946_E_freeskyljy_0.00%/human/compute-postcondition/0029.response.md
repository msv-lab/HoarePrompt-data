Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N` is an integer such that 2 < `N` <= 2 * 10^5; `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`; `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input; `nums_left` is `N - 4`; `i` is `N - 2`. If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `ans` is assigned the value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and `cur` is set to `M1 - 3`. Otherwise, `ans` is assigned the value of `ans * nums_left % MOD` and `cur` is set to `M1 - 2`.**

Natural Language: The value of `nums_left` is decremented by 1, so it is now `N - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
