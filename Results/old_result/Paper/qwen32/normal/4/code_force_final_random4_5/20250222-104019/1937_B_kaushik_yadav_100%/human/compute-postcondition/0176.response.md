The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply exits the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to include `a[i]` and `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
