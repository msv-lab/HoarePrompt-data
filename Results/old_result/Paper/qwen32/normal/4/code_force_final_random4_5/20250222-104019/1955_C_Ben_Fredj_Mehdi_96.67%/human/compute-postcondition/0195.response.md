Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers. `z` is incremented by 1. If `k` is not equal to 99999999999999, the state of `a` and `k` may change based on specific conditions: if `k` is 200000000000, 2147483648, 1000000000, 5999999999, or 4294967295, and `n` is 2, 5, 20, or 2, the state remains as per the precondition. If `n` == 2, `k` is set to `a[0] - 1` and then updated to `a[1] - 2`. If `k` == 3000000000, `z` is incremented by 1 again. If `k` is not 3000000000 and `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of `a`, `z` is incremented by 1. If `k` is less than the sum of `a`, the first `k // 2` and last `k // 2` elements of `a` are decremented by 1, and if `k` is odd, the first non-zero element `a[g]` is also decremented by 1, with `z` incremented by `k // 2`.**
