### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen, based on the periodicities of the signs. Let's break down the logic and verify if the program correctly implements the solution.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Logic for Determining the Year:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, representing the starting point (year 0).
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
     - Incrementing `start_year` by 1 (since the next sign must occur strictly after the previous one).
     - Dividing `start_year` by the periodicity `nums[x]` and adding 1 to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` to get the actual year.
   - This ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one and at the correct periodicity.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the `start_year`, which represents the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

- Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
- Initial `start_year = 0`
- For the first sign (`a_1 = 3`):
  - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- For the second sign (`a_2 = 2`):
  - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
- For the third sign (`a_3 = 4`):
  - `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
- For the fourth sign (`a_4 = 5`):
  - `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
- For the fifth sign (`a_5 = 9`):
  - `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
- For the sixth sign (`a_6 = 18`):
  - `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The computed `start_year` is 36, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicities of the signs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
