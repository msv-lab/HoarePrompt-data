Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2` (must be greater than 0), `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `T` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `r` is `r - 1` if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` is `r - 1`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is set to 3 if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is set to 2 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, or 1 otherwise. If `a[l]` is not 0, `l` remains unchanged and `ans` is set to 2 if `mi * 2 <= k` and `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is set to 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, or 0 otherwise. `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`. `ans` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `r` is decremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
