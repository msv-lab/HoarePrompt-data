The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. The element added is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. The values of `n`, `r`, and `q` are used in this calculation. Since `q` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state, we assume `q` is one of the elements from the original `ans` set. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m-2` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is either '0' or '?'. `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element, where each element is a value `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`.**
