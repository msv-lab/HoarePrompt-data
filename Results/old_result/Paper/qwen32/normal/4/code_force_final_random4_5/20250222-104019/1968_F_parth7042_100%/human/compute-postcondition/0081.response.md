The code snippet `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. No other variables are affected by this operation. 

Given the initial state, the value of `index` was `n + 3`. After the increment, the new value of `index` is `n + 5`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0 (specifically, `t` is now `t - 1`); `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integer values of `data[3]` to `data[n + 2]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 5`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO'); `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR up to that point.**
