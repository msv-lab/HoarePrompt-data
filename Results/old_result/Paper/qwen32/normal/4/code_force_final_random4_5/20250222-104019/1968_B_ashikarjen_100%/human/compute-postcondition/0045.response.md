Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is equal to `m` (indicating that no match was found for `b[j] == a[1]`); we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
