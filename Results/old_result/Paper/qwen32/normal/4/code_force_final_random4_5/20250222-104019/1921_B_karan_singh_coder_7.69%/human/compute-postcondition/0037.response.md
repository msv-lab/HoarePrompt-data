Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the new input string, `s1` is the count of '1's in the new `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in `t`, and `cnt` is the number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Additionally, `s1` is not equal to `t1`.**
