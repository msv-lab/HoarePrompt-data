To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it terminates.

The loop iterates through the list `l` using the variable `i` as an index. For each iteration, it checks if the value at `l[p - 1]` (where `p` is the value at `l[i]`) is equal to `i + 1`. If this condition is met, it prints `2`, sets `j` to `1`, and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it continues to the next iteration.

Given the initial state and the descriptions of the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- The loop will continue to iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.
- If the condition `q == i + 1` is never met during the iterations, the loop will complete all `n` iterations.
- If the condition is met at any point, the loop will terminate early, and `j` will be set to `1`.

The final output state will depend on whether the condition `q == i + 1` was ever met during the iterations:

1. **If the condition `q == i + 1` is met at any point:**
   - The loop will terminate early.
   - `i` will be the index at which the condition was met.
   - `j` will be set to `1`.
   - `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - The list `l` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `p` and `q` will be the values at the point where the condition was met.

2. **If the condition `q == i + 1` is never met:**
   - The loop will complete all `n` iterations.
   - `i` will be equal to `n`.
   - `j` will remain `0`.
   - `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - The list `l` remains unchanged.
   - The values of `p` and `q` will be the values at the last iteration.

Since the specific values of `p` and `q` at the end of the loop are not critical to the final output state (as they are not part of the precondition or the final state description), we can describe the final state in terms of `i` and `j`.

**Output State:**
- If the condition `q == i + 1` is met during the iterations:
  - `i` will be the index where the condition was met.
  - `j` will be `1`.
  - `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
  - The list `l` remains unchanged.

- If the condition `q == i + 1` is never met during the iterations:
  - `i` will be equal to `n`.
  - `j` will be `0`.
  - `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
  - The list `l` remains unchanged.

Given that the problem does not specify the exact values of `n` and the contents of `l`, we can only describe the final state in terms of these conditions. However, the most general final state, assuming the condition is never met, is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer value of the user's input; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is equal to `n`; `j` is 0.**

This describes the state when the loop completes all iterations without finding a match for the condition `q == i + 1`.
