The given code snippet updates the variable `sm` by adding the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` to it. Here's the impact on the variables:

- `sp` is already defined as `2 * a[s] + a[s]`, which simplifies to `3 * a[s]`.
- `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + 3 * a[s])`.

Given the initial state, the value of `sm` changes based on the comparison between `sm` and `a[s] * k + 3 * a[s]`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s-1`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `bp`, `bm`) remain unchanged unless `k` is 0, in which case the loop or if statement is broken out of, but this condition is not directly affecting the current line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 2`, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is `p[p[original_b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `3 * a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + 3 * a[s])`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
