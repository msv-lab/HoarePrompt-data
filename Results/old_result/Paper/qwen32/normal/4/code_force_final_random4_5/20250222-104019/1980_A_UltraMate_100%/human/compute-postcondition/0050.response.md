Postcondition: **`t` is 19, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is a non-empty string, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, and `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`. If the frequency of the character `i` in `hmp` is less than `m`, then `ans` is `4 * m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `3 * m`.**
