The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. The values of `k`, `arr`, and `pos` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so they should not be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is set by the `range(n)` function in the loop head.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**
