Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer where t=1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, and there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone. `numbers` is a list containing one element, which is a list `[num1, num2]`. If the length of `nums` is not equal to 2, the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `nums` is 2, the code continues with the existing state of the variables.**
