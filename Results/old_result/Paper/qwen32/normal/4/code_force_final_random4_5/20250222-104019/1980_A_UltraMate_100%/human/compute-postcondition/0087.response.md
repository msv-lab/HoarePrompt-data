Given the initial state described as `ans_initial + sum_diff`, it suggests that the variable `ans` is the result of adding `ans_initial` and `sum_diff`. However, the exact values of `ans_initial` and `sum_diff` are not provided in the initial state description.

To determine what will be printed, we need to infer that `ans` is the sum of `ans_initial` and `sum_diff`.

Let's break down the information:
- `ans_initial` is a variable with some value.
- `sum_diff` is another variable with some value.
- `ans` is the result of `ans_initial + sum_diff`.

Since the exact values of `ans_initial` and `sum_diff` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **ans (where ans is the result of ans_initial + sum_diff)**
