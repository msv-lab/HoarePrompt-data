Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 1; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is a string that will be updated.

The code snippet:
```
kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
```
This line of code appends the string representation of `x` to the existing string `kq1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 1; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
