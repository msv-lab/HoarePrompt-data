Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `j` is 1; `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `k` is set to 2.**
