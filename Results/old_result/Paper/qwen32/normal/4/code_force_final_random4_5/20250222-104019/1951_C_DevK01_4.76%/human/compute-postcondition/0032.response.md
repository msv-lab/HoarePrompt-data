Output State: **`L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; if `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. If `n * m` is not equal to `k`, `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`; `w` is the last element of the original `N`. `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**

In simple terms, the variable `mu` has been updated to the value of `k - (n - 1) * m`. All other variables retain their previously defined values and conditions.
