### Reasoning:

The problem involves a two-step game where Alice and Bob manipulate an array to achieve their respective goals. Alice aims to maximize the sum by removing up to `k` elements, and Bob aims to minimize the sum by negating up to `x` elements. The solution involves sorting the array and then computing the optimal result based on the possible actions of Alice and Bob.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.
- The array `a` is sorted.
- The function `func_2` is called with `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.
- The result from `func_2` is printed.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` calculates the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob perform their optimal moves.
- It initializes `pos` with the sum of the array minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements (since Bob can negate these elements).
- It iterates through the number of elements Alice can remove (`removals`), updating the sum `s` and the sum of the negated elements `s2` accordingly.
- For each iteration, it calculates a new possible sum and appends it to `pos`.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

#### Correctness:
- The sorting of the array ensures that the smallest elements are considered first for removal by Alice, and the largest elements are considered first for negation by Bob.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the removal of elements by Alice and the negation of elements by Bob, updating the sums accordingly.
- The function returns the maximum possible sum after both players have made their optimal moves.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Correctness: **True**
