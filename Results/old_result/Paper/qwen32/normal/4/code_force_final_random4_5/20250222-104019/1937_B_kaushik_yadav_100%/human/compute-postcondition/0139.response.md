Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases), `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the new input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the conditions described, `i` equals the length of `a`, `work` is True or False depending on the last iteration, `j` is 0. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 3. Otherwise, `counter` is 2 if `a[j + 1]` is not equal to '0' or `b[j]` is not equal to '1', and `counter` is 1 if `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1'.**
