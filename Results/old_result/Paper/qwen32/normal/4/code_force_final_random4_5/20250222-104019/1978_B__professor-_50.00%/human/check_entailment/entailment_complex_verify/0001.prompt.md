You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationships between `n`, `a`, and `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
Bob wants to maximize his profit from selling `n` buns. He can sell the first `k` buns at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `(b - k + 1)`, and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at a fixed price `a`.

### Key Observations:
1. **If `b <= a`:** Selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal because the promotional price is not beneficial.
2. **If `b - a >= n`:** Selling all buns at the promotional price is optimal because the price difference is large enough to cover all buns with decreasing prices.
3. **Otherwise:** We need to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.

### Formula Analysis:
- **When `b - a >= n`:** The total profit is the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `(b - n + 1)`. This sum can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((\text{first term} + \text{last term}) \times \text{number of terms} / 2\), which translates to \((2b - n + 1) \times n / 2\).
- **When `b > a` and `b - a < n`:** We need to find the optimal `k` where the sum of the first `k` terms of the promotional price plus the remaining buns sold at `a` is maximized. This involves iterating through possible values of `k` to find the maximum profit, but the provided code simplifies this by directly calculating parts of the series.

### Code Review:
The provided code handles the first two cases correctly:
- **Case 1:** When `b <= a`, it directly multiplies `n` by `a`.
- **Case 2:** When `b - a >= n`, it uses the arithmetic series sum formula to calculate the total profit.

However, the third case is not handled correctly. The provided formula \(((b - a) / 2) * (b - a + 1) + a * n\) does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for `b > a` and `b - a < n`. The correct approach involves finding the optimal `k` by comparing the sum of the promotional prices with the usual price `a`.

### Correctness:
The code is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case when `b > a` and `b - a < n`. It does not find the optimal `k` for this scenario.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
