The given code snippet is simply reassigning an empty list to `max_heap`, which is already stated to be empty in the initial state. Therefore, this operation does not change the state of `max_heap` or any other variable.

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` are final pointers in `b`, `ans` is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
