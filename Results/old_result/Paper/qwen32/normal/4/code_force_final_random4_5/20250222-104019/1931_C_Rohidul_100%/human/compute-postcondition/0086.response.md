The code snippet `end += 1` increments the value of the variable `end` by 1. Based on the initial state, `end` is initially 3. After the increment, `end` becomes 4. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`r` is `le - 3`, `l` is `le - 3`, `a` is a list where all elements are the same, `end` is 4, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `st` is `le`**.
