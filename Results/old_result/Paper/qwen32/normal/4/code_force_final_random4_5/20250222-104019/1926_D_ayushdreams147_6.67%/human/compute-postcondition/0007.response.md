Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `res` is 0, `count` is a dictionary, and the value of `count[num]` has been decremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `count` has been reduced by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
