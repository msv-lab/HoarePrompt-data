The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Since the initial state specifies that `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements in `ar` and `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements, after executing the code, `minn` will hold the minimum of these two values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements, `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.**
