### Reasoning:
The provided program is not correct based on the problem description and the execution summary. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Logic of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a frequency table where each key is a unique number from the list and its value is the minimum of the number's occurrences in the list and `k`. While the function does this correctly, it does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
   
2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in the program is flawed. The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table, which is not relevant to determining the minimum number of cards left.
   - The program should calculate the minimum number of cards left by considering the frequency of each card and applying the operation as many times as possible.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each unique number in the list, calculate how many times you can perform the operation (i.e., how many groups of `k` cards you can form).
   - For each group of `k` cards, you reduce the count of that card by `k-1` (since you exchange `k` cards for `k-1` cards).
   - The final count of cards will be the sum of the remaining cards after performing all possible operations.

### Correctness:
Given the issues described above, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
