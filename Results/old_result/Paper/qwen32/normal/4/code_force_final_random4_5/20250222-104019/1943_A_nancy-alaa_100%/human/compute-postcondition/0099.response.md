To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 0.
- `i` is defined as `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

### Analysis:
From the information provided, we know that `i` is updated based on the value of `k` from the previous iteration. However, the initial value of `i` before any iterations is not specified. Therefore, we can only describe the value of `i` in terms of its relationship to `k` from the previous iteration.

### Print Statement:
```
print(i)
```

### Explanation:
Since the initial value of `i` is not given, we can't determine an exact numerical value for `i`. However, we know that `i` is always `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration. This implies that `i` is always one more than its value in the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
The value of `i` to be printed is dependent on the previous value of `i` (denoted as `k`). Without the initial value of `i`, we can only describe the value of `i` in terms of this relationship.

### Output:
Output: **i (where i is k + 1, and k is the value of i from the previous iteration)**
