Reasoning:

The provided program calculates the maximum possible sum of the elements in the \(n \times n\) matrix by using a specific formula and performs operations on the matrix to achieve this sum. Let's break down the program's logic and verify its correctness.

### Calculation of the Sum:
The program calculates the sum using the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\). This formula is indeed the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3\). Here is how it is derived:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = \left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2
\]

However, the program does not directly use this formula. Instead, it uses a loop to calculate the sum incrementally:

```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```

This loop essentially calculates the sum of cubes by adding \(i^3\) for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n\):

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \ldots + n^3
\]

The sum of cubes formula \(\left(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\right)^2\) confirms that the program correctly calculates the maximum sum.

### Operations on the Matrix:
The program performs exactly \(2n\) operations to fill the matrix. For each \(j\) from 1 to \(n\), it performs two operations:
1. Type 1 operation on row \(n - j + 1\) with permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
2. Type 2 operation on column \(n - j + 1\) with permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).

These operations ensure that the matrix is filled in such a way that the sum of all elements is maximized. Specifically, the operations fill the matrix in a way that each row and each column contains the numbers from 1 to \(n\) exactly once, leading to the maximum possible sum.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the required operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit of \(2n\) operations. Therefore, the program is correct.
