The code snippet creates a list `pre` that contains the indices (1-based) of all '>' characters in the string `s1`. Given the initial state, the only change is the creation of the `pre` list.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`.**
