Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. However, the program sorts the array and then prints it as a string, which does not compute the beauty of the array. It should instead compute the beauty by calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The program currently prints the sorted array as a string of space-separated values, which is not the expected output. The correct approach would be to sort the array, compute the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing the differences between consecutive elements, and then print this computed beauty for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
