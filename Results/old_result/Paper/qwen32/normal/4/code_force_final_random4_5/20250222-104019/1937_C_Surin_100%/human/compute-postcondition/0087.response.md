Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is at least 2.
2. `g` is 0.
3. `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`.
4. `v2` is `n-1`.
5. `i` is `n-1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is defined as the largest integer `i` from 1 to `n-1` for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`. However, the exact value of `v1` is not provided in the initial state. It depends on the user's responses, which are not detailed here.
- `v2` is explicitly defined as `n-1`.
- The print statement formats a string with `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`.

### Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `v1`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v2`. Since `v2` is explicitly `n-1`, we can describe `v2` in terms of `n`. However, `v1` remains as it is because its exact value is not provided.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] [n-1] [n-1] (where v1 is the largest integer i from 1 to n-1 for which the user's response was '>' or '=' followed by '<', and n is at least 2)**
