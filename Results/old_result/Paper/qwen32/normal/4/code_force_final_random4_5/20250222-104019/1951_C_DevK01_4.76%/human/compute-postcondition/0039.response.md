The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t`; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
