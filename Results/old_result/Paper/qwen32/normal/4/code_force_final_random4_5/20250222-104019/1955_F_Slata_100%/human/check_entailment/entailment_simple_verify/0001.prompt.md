You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: The sum of the computed values from each iteration, where each computed value is determined by the formula `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` for each set of input values `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand the rules of the game and how Eve can optimally remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

### Game Analysis
1. **Winning Condition**: Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero. Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
2. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is zero.
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.
3. **Numbers and Their XOR**:
   - 1 XOR 1 = 0
   - 2 XOR 2 = 0
   - 3 XOR 3 = 0
   - 4 XOR 4 = 0
   - 1 XOR 2 = 3
   - 1 XOR 3 = 2
   - 1 XOR 4 = 5 (which is 1 in 4-bit representation)
   - 2 XOR 3 = 1
   - 2 XOR 4 = 6 (which is 2 in 4-bit representation)
   - 3 XOR 4 = 7 (which is 3 in 4-bit representation)
4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**: Eve should aim to leave sequences with an even count of each number (except possibly one odd count) to maximize Bob's wins.

### Strategy Breakdown
- If the count of a number is even, it can be paired up to produce zeros.
- If the count of a number is odd, one number will remain unpaired.
- The XOR of the sequence will be zero if:
  - All counts are even.
  - All counts are even except one is odd.

### Program Analysis
The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
1. Counting the number of pairs for each number (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`).
2. Checking if there are exactly three odd counts (`a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`). If so, it adds one more to the count of Bob's wins.

This logic is based on the idea that:
- Each pair contributes to Bob's win.
- If there are exactly three odd counts, the XOR will be zero because the remaining unpaired numbers will cancel out in a way that leaves the XOR as zero.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the given examples:

1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (add 1)
   - Output: `1`

2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 0 + 1 = 2` (do not add 1)
   - Output: `1`

3. **Input**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (do not add 1)
   - Output: `3`

4. **Input**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 1 + 0 = 2` (do not add 1)
   - Output: `3`

5. **Input**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Pairs: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
   - Odd counts: `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (add 1)
   - Output: `12`

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.
