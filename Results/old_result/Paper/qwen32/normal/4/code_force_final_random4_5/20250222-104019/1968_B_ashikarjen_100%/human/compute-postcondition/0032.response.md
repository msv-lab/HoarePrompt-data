Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length m read from the input; `i` is 0. If `j` is less than `m` (indicating a match was found such that `b[j] == a[0]`), `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `m` and `k` is set to 0, indicating no match was found.**
