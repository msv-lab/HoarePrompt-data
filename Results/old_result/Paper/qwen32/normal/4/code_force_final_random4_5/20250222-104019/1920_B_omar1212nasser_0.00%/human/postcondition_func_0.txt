The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of positive integers and two limits. It sorts the array and then calculates the maximum possible sum of the array elements after allowing Alice to remove up to a specified number of elements and Bob to multiply up to a specified number of elements by -1. The function outputs the maximum sum for each test case.
