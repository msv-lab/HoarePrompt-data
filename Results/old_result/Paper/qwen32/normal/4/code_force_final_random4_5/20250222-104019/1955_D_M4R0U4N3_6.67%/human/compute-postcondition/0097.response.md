Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`; `todo` is an empty set; `extra` is the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`; `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` is updated to 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise, `ans` is set to 0. All other variables remain as they were initially described.
