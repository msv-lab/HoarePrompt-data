The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted. The loop runs for a number of times determined by the integer read from the input. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, which determines how many more times the loop will execute.

However, since we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head does not contain any variables that can be directly adjusted, the state remains the same in terms of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `k` is 1, the current value of `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The current value of `k` satisfies either `k <= 2 * n` or `k > 2 * n`.**
