The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, and `n`, `k`, `x` are also integers within specific ranges. The array `a` is mentioned but not modified by the given code snippet.

After executing the code, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` will be updated to the values read from the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.**
