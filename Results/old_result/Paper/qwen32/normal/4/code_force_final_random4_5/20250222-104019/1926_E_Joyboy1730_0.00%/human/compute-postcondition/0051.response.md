The code snippet `n -= m` reduces the value of `n` by `m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. This means `n` will be updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.

Given the initial state, the value of `n` is greater than 1. After the execution of `n -= m`, the value of `n` will be updated accordingly. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `L`, `pow`, `tot`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 0 and `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`; `k` is the second integer from the input; `L` is an empty list; `pow` is `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations completed; `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` up to the point where the loop breaks or finishes; `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
