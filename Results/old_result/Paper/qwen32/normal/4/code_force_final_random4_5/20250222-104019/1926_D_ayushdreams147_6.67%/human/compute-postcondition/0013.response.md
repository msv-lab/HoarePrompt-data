Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a`. If `num` was not in `count`, `res` is set to 2 or 1 depending on the previous iteration, and `count` is updated to increment the count of `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 1 or 0 depending on the previous iteration, and `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**
