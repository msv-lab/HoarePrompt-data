Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0`; `ol` is greater than `zr`; `zeroInd` is `0`; `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - x`; `fi` is `1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[i]` (where `i` is `n - 1`) has been updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. All other variables retain their initial values.
