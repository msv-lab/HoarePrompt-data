Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is True; `i` is 1. If `mpp[i]` is equal to 1 and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if statement, considering both the if and else parts. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged if the condition `mpp[i] == 1` is not met.
