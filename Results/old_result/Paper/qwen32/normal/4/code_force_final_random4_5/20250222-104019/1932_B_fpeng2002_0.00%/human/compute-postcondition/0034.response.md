The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range parameters (0 and `len(nums)`). Since the range is determined by the length of `nums`, which is not changing, we only need to adjust `x` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was 0, and `num_tests` was decremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` needs to be incremented by 1. The other variables (`start_year`, `n`, `nums`) do not need to be adjusted according to the loop head.

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`start_year` is `nums[0]`, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `x` is 1**
