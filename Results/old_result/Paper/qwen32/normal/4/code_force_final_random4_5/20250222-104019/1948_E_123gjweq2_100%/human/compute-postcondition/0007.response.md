The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `mid`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `mid - 1` (since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `mid`.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right - left >= 1, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is `mid`**
