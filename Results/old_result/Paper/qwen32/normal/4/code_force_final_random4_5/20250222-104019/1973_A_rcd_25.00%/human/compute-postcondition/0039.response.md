To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `high >= cur` is satisfied. 

Given:
- `cur` is equal to `low`.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

Since `cur` is set to `low`, the condition `high >= cur` will be true as long as `high` is greater than or equal to `low`, which is always the case by the definition of `low` and `high`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time because the condition `high >= cur` is inherently satisfied by the definitions of `low` and `high`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`.**
