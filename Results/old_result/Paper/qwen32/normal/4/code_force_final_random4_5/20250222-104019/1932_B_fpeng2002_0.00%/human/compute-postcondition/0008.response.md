The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range defined by `len(nums)`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0 and has been incremented by 1, so `x` is now 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be less than `len(nums)`.

State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `nums[0]`, `x` is 1**
