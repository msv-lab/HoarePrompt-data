The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables or any conditions outside of a loop. Since the provided code snippet only contains a `continue` statement and there is no loop structure present, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the conditions given.

Therefore, the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, and the condition that their sum is odd still holds.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
