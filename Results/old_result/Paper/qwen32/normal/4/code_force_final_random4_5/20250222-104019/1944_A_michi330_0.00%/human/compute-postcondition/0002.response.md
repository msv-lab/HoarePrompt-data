The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and `i` is 0. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values of the two integers from the input, and the other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are the two integers from the input.**
