Output State: **`start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` has one more node which is `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` includes `neighbor` if `neighbor` was not already in `visited`, `current` is a key in `tree` and `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `dist` is the distance associated with the `current` node if it was part of a tuple, otherwise it is the node itself, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`**

In simpler terms, the `queue` now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged or maintain their previous states.
