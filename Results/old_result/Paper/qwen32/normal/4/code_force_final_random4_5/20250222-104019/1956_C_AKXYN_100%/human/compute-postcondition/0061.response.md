Let's break down the given print statement and the initial state to determine the output.

### Given Initial State:
- `res` is 110 (though this variable is not used in the print statement, it's provided for completeness).
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (though this variable is not used in the print statement, it's provided for completeness).
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `i` is `n-2`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'2 %d' % i`**: This part of the print statement formats the integer `i` into a string, prefixed by "2 ". Since `i` is `n-2`, the formatted string will be `"2 [n-2]"`.
2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). The `*` operator unpacks this sequence so that each number is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- The formatted string `'2 %d' % i` will be `"2 [n-2]"` where `[n-2]` is the value of `i`.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` will produce the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Combining the Results:
The final output will be the string `"2 [n-2]"` followed by the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Output Format:
Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, we will express the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and the sequence continues from 1 to n)**

For example, if `n` were 5, then `i` would be `5-2 = 3`, and the output would be:
Output: **2 3 1 2 3 4 5**

However, since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we express the output in terms of `n`:
Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and the sequence continues from 1 to n)**
