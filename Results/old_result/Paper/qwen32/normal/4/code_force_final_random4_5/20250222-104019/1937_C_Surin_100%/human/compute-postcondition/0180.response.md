To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved in the `print` statement.

**Initial State Recap:**
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received).
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is 0.
- `kp` is `kp + 1` (though `kp` is not used in the print statement).
- `r` is the user input, `r` is not `'>'`, and `r` is `'='`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

Let's break down the variables in the `print` statement:
- `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since it is used twice in the print statement, we need to consider its value. Given the context, `i` is likely a loop index or a specific value related to the user input. Since no specific value for `i` is provided, we can't determine its exact numerical value but can describe its role.
- `prev` is explicitly defined as 0 in the initial state.

Since `i` is not explicitly defined and its value is not provided, we can describe its role and value based on the context. Given that `r` is `'='`, it suggests that `i` might be `v1` or `v2` depending on the logic of the program, but since no specific value is provided, we can only describe it as a variable used in the context.

However, since `i` is used twice and no specific value is given, we can infer that the value of `i` is consistent with the context where `r` is `'='`. Given the typical usage in such problems, `i` is often the midpoint or a value derived from the inputs, but without more context, we can't determine its exact value.

**Output Description:**
Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **? [i] [i] 0 0 (where [i] is the current value of the variable i, which is consistent with the context where r is '=')**
