Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.', `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `j` is `k + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `path`, `a`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
