Output State: **`x` is the fourth integer from the input, `y` is the fourth integer from the input, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all four iterations, the list `coord` will contain four tuples, each representing a pair of coordinates (x, y) that were input during the loop's execution. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair of coordinates input. The variable `i` will be 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `res` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop, and `n` is still a non-zero integer as per the initial conditions.
