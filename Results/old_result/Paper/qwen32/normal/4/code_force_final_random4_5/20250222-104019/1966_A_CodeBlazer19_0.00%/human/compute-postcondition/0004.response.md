Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 (this variable represents the number of test cases, but it's not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 0 (this variable is an index, but it's not used in the print statement).
- `n` is the first input integer (this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `k` is the second input integer (this variable is used in the print statement).
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input (this list is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

Based on the initial state, we know that `k` is an integer provided as input. The print statement will output the value of `k - 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, we can't provide a specific numerical output. However, we can describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the second input integer)**
