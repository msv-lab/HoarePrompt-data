Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The goal is to rearrange the permutation such that after performing at most 2 swaps, a binary search will correctly identify the position of the target number `x`. The current implementation does not perform any rearrangement of the array; it only checks if the element `x` is already in the correct position after a binary search would terminate.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The program performs a binary search on the unsorted permutation, which is not guaranteed to find the correct position of `x` after the search.
2. The program only checks if the element at index `l` is the target `x` after the binary search, but it does not perform any swaps to ensure that the binary search will correctly identify `x`.
3. The problem requires performing at most 2 swaps to ensure the binary search will terminate with `p_l` equal to `x`. The current implementation does not attempt to perform any swaps.

Given the problem constraints and the need to perform swaps, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
