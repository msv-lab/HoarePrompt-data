### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary provided.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with `x`, representing the starting player.

2. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads `r` and `c` using `func_1().split()`.
   - It converts `r` to an integer.
   - It initializes a temporary set `temp` to store possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - For each player `q` in the current set `ans`:
     - If the throw is clockwise (`c == '0'`) or the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`), it calculates the new position as `(q + r) % n` and adds it to `temp`.
     - If the throw is counterclockwise (`c == '1'`) or the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`), it calculates the new position as `(q - r) % n` and adds it to `temp`.
   - It updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the position wraps around the circle using modulo `n` operations.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the modulo operation. Specifically, `(q - r) % n` can result in a value of `0` if `q - r` is a negative number. In Python, the modulo operation with a negative number can result in a value between `0` and `n-1`, but this needs to be handled carefully to ensure it maps to the correct player number.

4. **Output:**
   - It prints the number of players who could have the ball, which is the size of `ans`.
   - It prints the sorted list of these players.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization:** The initial position `x` is correctly added to `ans`.
- **Throw Processing:** The logic for updating positions based on the throw direction and distance is correct. It considers both clockwise and counterclockwise movements when the direction is unknown.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program should handle the case where the position wraps around the circle using modulo `n` operations. However, the specific handling of `(q - r) % n` needs to be verified. In Python, `(q - r) % n` will always be a valid player number between `0` and `n-1`. If the result is `0`, it should be converted to `n` to represent the last player in the circle.
- **Output:** The output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Correctness Analysis:

The program's logic is mostly correct, but there is a minor issue with handling the modulo operation for counterclockwise throws. Specifically, the code correctly uses `(q - r) % n` but does not explicitly handle the conversion of `0` to `n` in all cases. However, since the problem specifies that players are numbered from `1` to `n`, and the modulo operation ensures that the result is within the range `0` to `n-1`, the conversion step `if 0 in ans: ans.discard(0); ans.add(n)` is necessary to convert `0` to `n`.

Thus, the program correctly implements the problem's logic and handles all specified cases.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
