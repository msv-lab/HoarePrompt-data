The code snippet initializes a list `prog_cities` with `n - 1` zeros, where `n` is the number of cities in each test case. The other variables (`cities`, which contains the test cases, and the elements within each test case like coordinates and queries) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a test case and contains the following elements: an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities, an integer `m` (1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, and a list of `m` pairs of integers `x_i, y_i` (1 ≤ `x_i, y_i` ≤ `n`; `x_i` ≠ `y_i`) representing the queries. For each city in each test case, the closest city is determined uniquely. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.**
