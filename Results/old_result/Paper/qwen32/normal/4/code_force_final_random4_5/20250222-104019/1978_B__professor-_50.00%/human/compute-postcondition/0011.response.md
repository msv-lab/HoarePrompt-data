Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input from the user. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then no further changes are made to `b`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a`, then `b - a` is either at least `n` or less than `n`.**
