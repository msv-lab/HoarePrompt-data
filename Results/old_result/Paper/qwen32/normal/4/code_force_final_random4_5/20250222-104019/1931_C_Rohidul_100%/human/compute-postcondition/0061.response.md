To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the conditions:

1. `r` is initialized to 0.
2. `end` is set to `n`, where `n` is an input integer.
3. `ans` is determined by a condition:
   - If the first element of the list `a` is equal to the last element of the list `a`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is `le - n`.
4. `n` is an input integer.
5. `a` is a list of integers.
6. `le` is the length of the list `a`.
7. `l` is set to `n - 1`.
8. `st` is set to `n`.

The key to solving this is understanding the value of `ans` based on the condition provided. We need to consider two scenarios:

### Scenario 1: First element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`
In this case, `ans` is calculated as `max(0, le - 2n)`. This means:
- If `le - 2n` is less than 0, `ans` will be 0.
- If `le - 2n` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` will be `le - 2n`.

### Scenario 2: First element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`
In this case, `ans` is simply `le - n`.

Since the specific values of `n` and the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute a numerical value for `ans`. However, we can provide a precise description of `ans` based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion
Given the initial state and the conditions, the output of the `print(ans)` statement can be described as follows:

- If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)`.
- If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is `le - n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is max(0, le - 2n) if the first element of a is equal to the last element of a, otherwise ans is le - n)**
