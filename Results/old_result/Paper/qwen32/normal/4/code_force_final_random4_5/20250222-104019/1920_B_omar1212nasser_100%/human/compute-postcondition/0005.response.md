The code snippet `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the `i`-th element from the end of the `elements` list from `s`. Let's update the values of the variables accordingly.

Initial State: 
- `removals` is at least 1
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`)
- `elements` is a list of integers
- `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`
- `s` is the sum of `elements`
- `s2` is the sum of `elements[-negatives:]`

After executing `s -= elements[-i]`:
- `s` is now `s - elements[-i]`
- `s2` is not directly affected by this operation, but it will be updated in subsequent operations if they involve `elements[-negatives:]`
- `pos` contains a value that was originally `s - 2 * s2`. After the change to `s`, `pos` would need to be recalculated if it is used again in the program, but its current stored value remains unchanged unless it is explicitly updated.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, `s2` is the sum of `elements[-negatives:]`**.

In natural language, `s` has been updated to be the original sum of `elements` minus the `i`-th element from the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged unless further operations modify them.
