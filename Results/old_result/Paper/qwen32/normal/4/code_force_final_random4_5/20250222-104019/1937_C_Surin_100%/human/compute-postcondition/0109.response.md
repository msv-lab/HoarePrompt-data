To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `n` must be greater than 1.
2. `g` is 0.
3. `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`.
4. `prev` is 0.
5. `kp` is unchanged (its value is not specified but it is irrelevant for this print statement).
6. `r` is the user's input, which is not `'>'` and is `'='`.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, but based on the context, we can infer that `i` is likely the value that was used to determine `v1` (the largest integer for which the user's response was `'<'`). However, since `r` is now `'='`, it indicates that the correct value has been found, and `i` should be `v1`.

Given that `prev` is explicitly stated as 0, the print statement will output:
- `?` as a literal character.
- `i` which is `v1` (the largest integer for which the user's response was `'<'`).
- `i` again, which is also `v1`.
- `prev` which is 0.
- `prev` again, which is also 0.

### Conclusion:
The exact value of `i` (or `v1`) is not provided in the initial state, but we know it is an integer between 1 and `n-1` for which the user's response was `'<'`. Therefore, the output will be in the format `? v1 v1 0 0`.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 0 0 (where [v1] is the largest integer from 1 to n-1 for which the user's response was '<')**
