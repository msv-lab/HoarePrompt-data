The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. This action does not change the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial state:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received)
- `v2` is `n-1`
- `prev` is 0
- `kp` is `kp + 1`

Since `sys.stdout.flush()` does not modify any variables, the values of all the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received), `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`**.
