The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `l`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.**
