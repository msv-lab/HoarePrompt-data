The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `max_heap`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the addition of the `max_heap` list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split substring to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a new input string, converting each split substring to an integer, and sorting the resulting list in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list.**
