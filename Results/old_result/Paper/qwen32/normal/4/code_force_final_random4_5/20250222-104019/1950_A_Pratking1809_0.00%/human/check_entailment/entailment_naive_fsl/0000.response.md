Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases due to the incorrect placement of the `else` statement. Specifically, the `else` statement is executed whenever the second `if` condition (`a < b > c`) is not met, which includes cases where `a < b < c` is also not true. This means that when `a < b < c` is true, it prints "STAIR", but then it also prints "NONE" because the `else` statement is executed immediately after.

To fix this, we need to use `elif` for the second condition so that only one of the conditions is printed for each test case. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify and print "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case based on the given conditions.
