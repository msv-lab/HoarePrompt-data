The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only change is in the set `temp`, which now includes the newly added value.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0, `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r`, and `c`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1().split()` and `r` is now an integer. `c` is either '1' or '?'. `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.**
