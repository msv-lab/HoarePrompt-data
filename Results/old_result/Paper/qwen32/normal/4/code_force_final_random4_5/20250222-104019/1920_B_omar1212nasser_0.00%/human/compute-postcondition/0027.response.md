Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals` and `negatives` as non-negative integers, and `elements` as a list of integers. The function returns 0 if an `IndexError` occurs during the execution. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * n`, where `s` and `n` are updated values from each iteration. If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` becomes 0, and the subsequent elements in `pos` are equal to `s`.**
