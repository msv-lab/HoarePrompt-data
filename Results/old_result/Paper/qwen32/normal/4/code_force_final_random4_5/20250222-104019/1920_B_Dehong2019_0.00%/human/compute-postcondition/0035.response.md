The code snippet assigns the sum of the list `a` to the variable `ans1`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, `ans2`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation.

Given that `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `sum(a)` will be the sum of all elements in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `k-1`; `ans1` is `sum(a)`; `ans2` is the value of `ans1` from the last iteration; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.**
