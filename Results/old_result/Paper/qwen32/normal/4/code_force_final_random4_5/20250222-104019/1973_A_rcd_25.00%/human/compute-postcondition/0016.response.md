Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is equal to `low`. Additionally, `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`**
