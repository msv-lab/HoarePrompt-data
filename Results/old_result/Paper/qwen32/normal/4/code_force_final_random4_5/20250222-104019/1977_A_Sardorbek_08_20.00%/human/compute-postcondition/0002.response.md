The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `b` and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that a >= 1, `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.**
