To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to understand the values of the variables `n` and `a` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1 (i.e., if there are `k` test cases, `t = k - 1`).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers that are input from the user.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(n * a)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement will output the result of the multiplication of `n` and `a`.
- Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers input from the user)**
