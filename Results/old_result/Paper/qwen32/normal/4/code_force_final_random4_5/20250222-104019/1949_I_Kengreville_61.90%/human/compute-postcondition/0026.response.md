Postcondition: **i is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the total number of disks. x, y, and r are lists of length n containing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively. visited is a list of boolean values of length n indicating whether a disk has been visited. nodes is a list that will store the indices of disks that are part of the current connected component being explored. coef0 and coef1 are lists of length n used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal. If the disk at index i was not visited, all disks that are part of the connected component starting from disk i will have their visited status set to True, the nodes list will include all indices of disks that are part of this connected component, and the coef0 and coef1 lists will have updated values for all disks in this connected component. If the disk at index i was already visited, there will be no changes to the visited, nodes, coef0, or coef1 lists.**
