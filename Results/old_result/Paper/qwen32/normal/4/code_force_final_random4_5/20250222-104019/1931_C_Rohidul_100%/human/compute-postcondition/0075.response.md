The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `l` is 2, so after the increment, `l` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` must be greater than 2, `l` is 3, `a` is a list where the first two elements and the third and fourth elements are the same, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `st` is 3**.
