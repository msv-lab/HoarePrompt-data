Output State: **`bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least 1 element, `t` is at least 1, `n` is the number of iterations, `tmp` is 1, and `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
