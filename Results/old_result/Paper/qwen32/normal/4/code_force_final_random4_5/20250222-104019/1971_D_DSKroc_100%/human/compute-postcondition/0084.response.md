Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It calculates and prints the number of positions where two consecutive characters in `s` are different, adding 1 to this count if there is no position where a '0' is followed by a '1'.**
