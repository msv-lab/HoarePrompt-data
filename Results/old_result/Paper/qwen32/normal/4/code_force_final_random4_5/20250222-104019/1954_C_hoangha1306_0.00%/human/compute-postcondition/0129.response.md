The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` appends the character at the `i`-th position of string `a` to the string `kq1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `kq1` is a string containing the character `a[i]`; `kq2` is an empty string; `vt` is 0; `q` is `q + 1`. The characters at the `i`-th position of `a` and `b` are equal.**
