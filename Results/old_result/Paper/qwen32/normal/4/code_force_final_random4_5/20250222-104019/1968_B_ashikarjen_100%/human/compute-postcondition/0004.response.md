The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `j`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input; `k` is 0; `j` is 0.**
