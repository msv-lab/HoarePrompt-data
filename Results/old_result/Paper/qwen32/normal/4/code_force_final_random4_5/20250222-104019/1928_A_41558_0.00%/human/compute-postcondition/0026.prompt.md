Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9; `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, then no further changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even, and if `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`. Otherwise, neither `a` is half of `b` nor `b` is half of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0. If both `a` and `b` are odd integers, no further changes are made to `a` or `b`. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`. Otherwise, neither `a` is half of `b` nor `b` is half of `a`. `i` is k + 1 where k is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0` is met; otherwise, the condition is not met. In both cases, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and the relationship for `i` remain unchanged. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a` in the else part, the condition is met; otherwise, it is not met, but this does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
