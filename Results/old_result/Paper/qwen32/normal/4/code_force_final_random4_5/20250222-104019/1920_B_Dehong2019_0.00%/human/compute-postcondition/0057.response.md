Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` is the value at the end of the previous iteration, adjusted to be within the range of the loop); `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop; `ans1` is the previous value of `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans1` has been updated by subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x]` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
