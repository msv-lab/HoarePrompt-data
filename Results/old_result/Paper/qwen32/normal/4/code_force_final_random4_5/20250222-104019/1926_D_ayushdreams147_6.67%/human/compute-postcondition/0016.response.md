The given code snippet increments the variable `res` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `num`, and `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]`) are not directly affected by this single line of code, except that `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` has already been incremented by 1 before the code snippet was executed.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_j` < 2^31, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1, `res` is incremented by 1.**
