Reasoning:

The provided program is incomplete and does not correctly determine whether the shape on the grid is a triangle or a square. The program only checks if the number of '1's in the first two rows is equal and prints the counts if they are, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the rows that contain '1's.
2. Determine the pattern of '1's in those rows.
3. Check if the pattern matches that of a square (all rows with the same number of '1's, aligned at the same position) or a triangle (number of '1's increasing or decreasing by 2 consecutively, centered).

The current program does not perform these checks and does not produce the correct output as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
