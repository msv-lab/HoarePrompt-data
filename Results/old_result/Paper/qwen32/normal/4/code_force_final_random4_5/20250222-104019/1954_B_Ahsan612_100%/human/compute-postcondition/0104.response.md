The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` can either be 2 or 3. Therefore, after the increment, `i` will either be 3 or 4.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `same`, and `minn`) are not affected by this operation. Their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is either 3 or 4, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[2]`. If `ar[i-1]` equals `num`, then `same` is 3 if `ar[i-2]` equals `num`, otherwise `same` is 2, and `minn` is `inf` if `same` is 3, otherwise `minn` is 1. If `ar[i-1]` does not equal `num`, then `num` is `ar[i-1]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**
