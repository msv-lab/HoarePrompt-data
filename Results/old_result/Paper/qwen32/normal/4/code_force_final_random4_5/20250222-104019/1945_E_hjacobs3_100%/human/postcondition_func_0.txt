The function takes a list `array` representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n and an integer `find`. It returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the largest index `l + 1` such that the element at index `l` is less than or equal to `find`, and the second string is the index of `find` in the array plus one. If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints 0.
