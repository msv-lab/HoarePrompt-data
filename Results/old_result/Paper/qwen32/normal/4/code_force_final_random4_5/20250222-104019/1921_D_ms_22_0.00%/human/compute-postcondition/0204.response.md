Output State: **`max_heap` contains tuples in the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, except for the one that was popped; `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 2`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple `(-diff, i, index)` that was popped from `max_heap` and its `index` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**

Explanation: The value of `tp2` has been decremented by 1, so if it was initially `m - 1`, it is now `m - 2`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
