Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 1, `slength` is an input integer, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and `x` is the character at index 1 in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
