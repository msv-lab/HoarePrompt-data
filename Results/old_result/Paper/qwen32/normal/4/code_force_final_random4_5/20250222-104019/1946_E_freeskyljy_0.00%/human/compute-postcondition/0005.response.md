Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 2 * 10^5, `M1` is an integer such that 1 <= `M1` <= `N`, `M2` is an integer such that 1 <= `M2` <= `N`; `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `p_i` <= `N`; `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}` are distinct integers in increasing order such that 1 <= `s_i` <= `N`. The sum of all `N` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `R` is a list of integers read from the input. Additionally, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.**
