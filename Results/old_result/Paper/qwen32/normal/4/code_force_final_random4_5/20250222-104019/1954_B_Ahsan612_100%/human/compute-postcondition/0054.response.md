The code snippet `same = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `same` is explicitly set to 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**
