Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains equal to `p3`. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to `p3 - 1`.**
