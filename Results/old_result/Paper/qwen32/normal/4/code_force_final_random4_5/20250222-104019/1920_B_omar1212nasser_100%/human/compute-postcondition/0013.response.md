The code snippet provided modifies the value of `s2` by subtracting the element at the `-i` index of the `elements` list from it. No other variables are directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `removals` is at least 1
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`)
- `elements` is a list of integers
- `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `s` is `s - elements[-i]`

After executing the code snippet `s2 -= elements[-i]`, the new state of `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i]`.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is `s - elements[-i]`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i]`**.
