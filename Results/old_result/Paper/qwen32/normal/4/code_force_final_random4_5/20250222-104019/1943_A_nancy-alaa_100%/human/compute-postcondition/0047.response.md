Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `first` is `True`.
- `i` is 0 and `mpp[i]` is 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly set to 0. The value of `i` does not depend on any other variables or conditions provided in the initial state. Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`.

Output: **0**
