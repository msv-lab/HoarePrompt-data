Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[n - 1]` which is set to `2 * n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `ans[n - 1]` is set to `1 - 2 * totalOne`; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `1`; `zeroInd` is `n` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `zeroInd` is `1`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `oneInd` is `2 * totalOne`.**
