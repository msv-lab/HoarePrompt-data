The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. Given the initial state, `old` is defined as `a[r - m]`, and `r` is defined as `r + 2`. However, the value of `r` in the expression `r - m` is the original value of `r` before it was incremented by 2. Therefore, `old` refers to the element at index `r - m` in the list `a`.

After executing `extra.remove(old)`, the list `extra` will no longer contain the element `a[r - m]`. The values of `r` and `old` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `extra` has `a[r - m]` removed from it.**
