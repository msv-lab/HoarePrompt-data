To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the purpose of the loop. The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it compares the `i`-th character of `s` and `t`. If they are not equal, it increments `cnt` by 1. Essentially, `cnt` counts the number of positions where the characters of `s` and `t` differ.

Given the initial state and the description of the loop's behavior, after all `n` iterations, `cnt` will represent the total number of positions where `s` and `t` differ.

**Output State: cnt is the total number of positions where the characters of s and t differ.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all of its iterations, `cnt` will hold the value representing how many characters in the strings `s` and `t` do not match. The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `s1`, and `t1` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
