The code snippet `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of `ar[i]` based on the value of `i`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is 4, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`.
- Otherwise, `i` is 5 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` otherwise `i` is 6, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 otherwise `ar[4]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 2 if `i` was 3 otherwise `minn` is 1.

Since `i` can be 4, 5, or 6, we need to consider these cases:
1. If `i` is 4, then `num` is `ar[4]`.
2. If `i` is 5, then `num` is `ar[5]`.
3. If `i` is 6, then `num` is `ar[6]`.

However, the initial state specifies that if `i` is 4, then `num` is already `ar[4]`. If `i` is 5 or 6, `num` is not specified directly but is instead given as `ar[3]` or `ar[4]` depending on previous conditions which are not met here. Thus, the only direct assignment from the given initial state is when `i` is 4.

Therefore, `num` will be `ar[4]` after the execution of the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 6 elements, `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[4]`, `same` is 3, `minn` is `inf`.**
