To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a string representing the input value.
   - `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` ten times.
   - `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` ten times.
   - `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the last input string by spaces.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. Otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to 2.
   - `x` and `y` are lists, each containing the integer value of the first and second substrings of `t`, respectively, repeated ten times.
   - The print statement will output the value of `y[2]` followed by a space and then the value of `x[2]`.

4. **Determining the Values:**
   - Since `x` and `y` are lists with repeated values, `x[2]` and `y[2]` will be the same as `x[0]` and `y[0]`, respectively.
   - `x[0]` is the integer value of the first substring of `t`.
   - `y[0]` is the integer value of the second substring of `t`.

5. **Output:**
   - The output will be the integer value of the second substring of `t`, followed by a space, and then the integer value of the first substring of `t`.

Therefore, the output will be the second substring's integer value, a space, and the first substring's integer value.

Output: **[second substring's integer value] [first substring's integer value] (where the first and second substrings are derived from the input string `t`)**
