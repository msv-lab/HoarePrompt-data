The code snippet provided is `ans += b[i]`. This line appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`.

Given the initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a non-empty string.
- `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `i` is less than the length of `a`.
- `work` is a boolean variable.
- `ans` is a string that gets modified based on the conditions.

The line `ans += b[i]` modifies `ans` by appending the character `b[i]` to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `work`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is less than the length of `a`; `work` is a boolean variable; `ans` includes the character `b[i]` appended to it.**
