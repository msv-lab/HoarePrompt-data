To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables involved in the loop condition. The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`. Therefore, we need to ensure that both conditions hold true for the loop to execute again.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Condition `j < m`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.
   - Since `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, ensuring `j < m` is straightforward as long as `j` is incremented correctly within the loop. For the purpose of this task, we assume `j` is incremented within the loop, so we need to make sure `j` is not equal to `m` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is at least 1 and less than `m`. Since `j` is currently 1, we can keep it as 1 (or any value less than `m`), and it should be incremented within the loop.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `j` is currently 1, we need to ensure `b[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`.

Given the above points, we need to adjust the state such that `j` remains less than `m` and `b[j]` (specifically `b[1]` in this case) is not equal to `a[i]` (specifically `a[1]`).

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input such that `b[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`; `i` is 1; `j` is 1**
