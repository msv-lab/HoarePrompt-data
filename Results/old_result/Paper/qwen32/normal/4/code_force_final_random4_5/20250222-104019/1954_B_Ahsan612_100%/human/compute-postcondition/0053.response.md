The code snippet updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (which is 1). Since `same` is 1 and `minn` is initially `inf`, `minn` will be updated to 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**
