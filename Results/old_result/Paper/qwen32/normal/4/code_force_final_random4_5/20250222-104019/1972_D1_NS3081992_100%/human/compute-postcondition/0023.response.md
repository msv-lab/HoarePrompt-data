Functionality: **The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d` with integer keys and lists of integers as values, a list of integers `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list of integers `rank`. The function returns 1 if a specific condition is met (Case_1). Otherwise, it returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by recursive calls to `func_12` with `di` as the new `da` for all `di` in `d[da]` (Case_2).**
