Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 2 <= `k` <= 100. `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `c_i` <= 100 for each `i` in the range 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is reassigned to the value of the integer input, while the preconditions for `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided.
