The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation on the variable `ans` with the value `1`. Given that the initial value of `ans` is `1`, the result of `1 XOR 1` is `0`.

Thus, the value of `ans` changes from `1` to `0`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less.**
