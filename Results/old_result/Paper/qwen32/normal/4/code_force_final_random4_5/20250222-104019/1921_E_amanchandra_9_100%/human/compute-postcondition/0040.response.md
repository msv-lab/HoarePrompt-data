Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer that is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as initially described, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the integers from the input. If `a > c`, the state of the variables remains as initially described. Otherwise, `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, then `r` is `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is `max(1, d - x)`. Otherwise, `r` is `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**
