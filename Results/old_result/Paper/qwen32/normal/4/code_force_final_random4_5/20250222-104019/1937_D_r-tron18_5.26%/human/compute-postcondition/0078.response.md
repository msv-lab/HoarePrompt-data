To determine the Output State after the given Python code snippet is executed, we need to focus on the variable `zeroInd` and how it is calculated. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly mentioned in the code snippet.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
```

Let's break down the impact of this line on the program:
- The value of `zeroInd` is updated based on the result of the function `func_1` called twice with different parameters.
- The function `func_1` is not defined in the snippet, so we cannot compute its exact return value. However, we can express `zeroInd` in terms of the function calls.

Given that the other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `oneInd`) are not directly modified by this line, their states remain the same.

The Output State will be:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el` and now includes an additional element which is the sum of the last element of `suffZero` and `i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `ol` and `zr` are recalculated; `oneInd` and `zr` are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**

In simple terms, `zeroInd` is now calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and all other variables retain their previous values.
