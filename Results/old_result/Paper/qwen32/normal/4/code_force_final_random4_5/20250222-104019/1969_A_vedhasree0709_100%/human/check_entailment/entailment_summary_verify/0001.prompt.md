You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that following the permutation defined by `p` starting from `i` leads back to `i` in exactly two steps. If such an index exists, it outputs `2`; otherwise, it outputs `3`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program based on the problem description provided.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a set of friends, each with a unique best friend. Monocarp wants at least two friends to attend his party, and a friend will only attend if both they and their best friend receive an invitation. The task is to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send to ensure at least two friends attend the party.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a loop to iterate through each friend and checks if there is a pair of friends who are best friends with each other (i.e., if `p_i` and `p_j` exist such that `p_i = j + 1` and `p_j = i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` (indicating that inviting these two friends is sufficient). If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Logic for Finding Pairs**: The program correctly identifies if there is a mutual best friend relationship (a cycle of length 2). However, it does not consider other configurations that might require fewer than 3 invitations.
2. **Handling Larger Cycles**: The program assumes that if no mutual best friend relationship is found, the minimum number of invitations is 3. However, this is not always true. For example, if the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 3 or more, it may be possible to invite fewer than 3 friends to get at least two to attend.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the best friend relationships form more complex structures, such as multiple disjoint cycles or a single large cycle.

### Correctness:
Given the above points, the program is not correct for all possible inputs. It fails to consider configurations other than mutual best friend relationships (cycles of length 2) and may incorrectly output `3` when fewer invitations are needed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not cover all possible scenarios and can incorrectly determine the minimum number of invitations required.
