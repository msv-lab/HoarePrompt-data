Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `c_i` is the minimum of `a_i` and `b_i`; `suff` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`; `ans` is `min(float('inf'), a[0] + suff[1]); `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0.** 

Natural Language: The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (which is `float('inf')`) and the sum of `a[0]` and `suff[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
