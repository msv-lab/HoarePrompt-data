The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This means the variable `n` is being reassigned to the integer value of the user's input. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the integer value of the user's input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is `n`; `j` is `0` indicating that no `q` equals `i + 1` during any iteration.**
