The code snippet `b = input()` reads a new value for `b` from the input. This means the original value of `b` is replaced with whatever is input during the execution.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a binary string of length `n` read from input; `b` is a new binary string read from input.**
