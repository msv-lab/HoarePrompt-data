Postcondition: **`d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `d[da]` has at least two elements, `processing` is a list of integers, `da` is an integer, `rank` is a list of integers, and `di` is the second element of `d[da]`. If `processing[di - 1] == 0`, then `tmp` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.**
