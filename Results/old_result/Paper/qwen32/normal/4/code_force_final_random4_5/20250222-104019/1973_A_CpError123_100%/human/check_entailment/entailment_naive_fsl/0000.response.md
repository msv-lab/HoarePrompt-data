Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle all edge cases and potential scenarios as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample:

The logic in the code is as follows:
1. For each test case, it checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is not possible with the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 0, 1, or 2 points).
2. If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as half of the total score and `y` as the sum of the lowest two scores.
3. It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`.

However, this logic does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. Let's consider a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
0 0 2
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
- The only way to achieve scores of `0, 0, 2` is if the third player won one game against one of the other players. This means there could be a draw in that game, but since the third player has 2 points, it implies they won the game. Therefore, the maximum number of draws is `0` (since there is no draw that could result in a score of `2` for one player while the other two have `0`).

However, the code will output:
```
1
```
This is because:
- `(a + b + c) = 2` which is even.
- `x = (2 // 2) = 1`
- `y = (0 + 0) = 0`
- `min(x, y) = 0` would be the correct answer, but the code incorrectly calculates `min(x, y) = 1`.

Thus, the code fails to correctly compute the maximum number of draws for this case, making it incorrect.

Therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
