The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, `k` are the three integers read from the input.**
