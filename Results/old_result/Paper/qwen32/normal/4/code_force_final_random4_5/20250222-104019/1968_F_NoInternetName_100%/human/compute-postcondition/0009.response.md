The code snippet appends a new element to the list `x`. This new element is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the variable `i`. Given that `x` initially contains `[0, 0 ^ i]`, appending `x[-1] ^ i` means that the new element will be `(0 ^ i) ^ i`, which simplifies to `0` due to the properties of XOR (any number XORed with itself is 0).

Thus, the list `x` will now be `[0, 0 ^ i, 0]`.

The variables `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `inds`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i, 0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 1]` and `inds[i]` is `[0, 1]`, `i` is the next element in `a`.**
