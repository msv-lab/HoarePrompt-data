The code snippet `s -= elements[-i]` subtracts the element at the index `-i` (which is `-4` in this case) from `s`. This means `s` is updated to be its previous value minus the value of `elements[-4]`.

Given that `i` is 4, `s` is updated to `s - elements[-4]`.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing two elements `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]`, `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `elements[-(negatives + 4)] - elements[-4]` if no `IndexError` occurs, or `n` is 0 if an `IndexError` occurs, `i` is 4.**
