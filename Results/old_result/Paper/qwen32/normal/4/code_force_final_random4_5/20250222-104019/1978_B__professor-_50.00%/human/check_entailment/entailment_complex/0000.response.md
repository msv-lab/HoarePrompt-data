### Reasoning:

The provided program calculates the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions. Let's break down the logic:

1. **When `b <= a`:** 
   - Selling all buns at the usual price `a` is optimal because the modified price `b` is not higher.
   - The profit is simply `n * a`.

2. **When `b - a >= n`:**
   - This condition implies that the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is large enough such that selling all `n` buns at the modified prices would yield a higher profit.
   - The profit can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   - The sum of the first `n` terms of such a sequence is: \(\frac{(2b - n + 1) * n}{2}\).

3. **For other cases (`b > a` and `b - a < n`):**
   - Here, it's optimal to sell some buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price.
   - The number of buns to sell at the modified price is `b - a` because after selling `b - a` buns, the price of the next bun would be `a`.
   - The profit from selling `b - a` buns at the modified price is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price is `(n - (b - a)) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:
- **Example 1:** `n = 4, a = 4, b = 5`
  - `b > a` and `b - a < n` (5 > 4 and 5 - 4 < 4), so we sell 1 bun at 5 coins and 3 buns at 4 coins.
  - Profit = 5 + 4*3 = 17.
- **Example 2:** `n = 5, a = 5, b = 9`
  - `b - a >= n` (9 - 5 >= 5), so we sell all 5 buns at modified prices.
  - Profit = (2*9 - 5 + 1) * 5 / 2 = 35.
- **Example 3:** `n = 10, a = 10, b = 5`
  - `b <= a`, so we sell all buns at the usual price.
  - Profit = 10 * 10 = 100.
- **Example 4:** `n = 5, a = 5, b = 11`
  - `b - a >= n` (11 - 5 >= 5), so we sell all 5 buns at modified prices.
  - Profit = (2*11 - 5 + 1) * 5 / 2 = 45.

The program correctly implements the logic for each of these cases.

### Correctness: **True**
