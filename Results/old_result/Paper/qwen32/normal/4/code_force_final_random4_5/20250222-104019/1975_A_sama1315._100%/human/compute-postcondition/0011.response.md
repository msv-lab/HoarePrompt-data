To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state. Here's the breakdown:

- `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from converting elements of `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers.
- `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- `idx` is `2 + n`.
- `t` is an integer value greater than 0.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
result = func_1(a)
```

This line of code calls a function `func_1` with the argument `a` and assigns the result to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact value of `result` without knowing what `func_1` does. However, we can still describe the state of the variables after this line has been executed.

The variables that are not affected by this line of code are:
- `input` (still the function `sys.stdin.read`).
- `data` (still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input).
- `idx` (still `2 + n`).
- `t` (still an integer value greater than 0).
- `results` (still an empty list).
- `n` (still the integer value of `data[1]`).

The variable `result` is newly assigned the value returned by `func_1(a)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
