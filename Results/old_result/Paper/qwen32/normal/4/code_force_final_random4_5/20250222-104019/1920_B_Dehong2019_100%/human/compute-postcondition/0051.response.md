The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` modifies the value of `ans1` by adding the element at index `i` of the list `a` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is a sorted list in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans1` is `ans1 + a[i]`, `ans2` is calculated as per the given conditions.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains unchanged, `n` retains its value as the first input integer, `k` is still greater than 0, `x` retains its value as the third input integer, `a` remains a sorted list in descending order, `i` has been incremented by 1, `ans1` has been updated to its previous value plus the element at index `i` of `a`, and `ans2` remains calculated as per its original conditions.
