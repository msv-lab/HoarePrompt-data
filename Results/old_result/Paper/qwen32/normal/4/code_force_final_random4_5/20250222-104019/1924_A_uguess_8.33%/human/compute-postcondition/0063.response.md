Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `cnt` is 1; `i` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1. The value of `cur` is 0.**

This means that all the previous conditions and values remain the same except for `cur`, which is now set to 0.
