Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr`, sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.**
