The value of `m` is assigned the result of `n - num`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, `m` will be an integer that is the difference between `n` and `num`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`.**
