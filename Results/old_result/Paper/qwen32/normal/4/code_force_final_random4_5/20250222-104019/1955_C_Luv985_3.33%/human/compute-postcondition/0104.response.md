Output State: **`l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` if `l` is 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 2` if `l` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where `a[l]` is reduced by `mi` and `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` are decreased by `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `ans` is 2 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `T` is truthy and has been decremented by 1, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` is 0 if it was equal to `mi`, `a[r]` is 0 if it was equal to `mi`, `t` is `k % 2` if `mi * 2 > k`.** 

In simpler terms, the value of `a[r]` has been reduced by `mi`. All other variables remain in their previous states unless specified otherwise.
