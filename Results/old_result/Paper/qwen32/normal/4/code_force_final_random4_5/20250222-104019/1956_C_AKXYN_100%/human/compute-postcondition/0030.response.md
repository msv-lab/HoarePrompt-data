The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will be 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 3, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 21, `i` is 3**
