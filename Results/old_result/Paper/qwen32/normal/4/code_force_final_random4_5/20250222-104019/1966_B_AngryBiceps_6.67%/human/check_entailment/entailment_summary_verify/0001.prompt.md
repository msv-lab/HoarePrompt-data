You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it prints 'YES' if the grid meets certain conditions (either the first row is not uniform or the first and last rows are the same), otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it's correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using a specific operation. The operation allows selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color. To solve this, we need to check if we can make the entire grid either all 'W' or all 'B'.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Color Grid**: If the grid already consists of all 'W' or all 'B', the answer is trivially "YES".
2. **Corner and Edge Analysis**: If there is a single color in the first row and the same color in the last row, and these colors are different, then it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because we cannot change the color of squares between these two rows using the given operation. The same logic applies to the first and last column.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program checks the following:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself.
- It constructs two strings: `first_row` containing the first column of each row and `last_row` containing the last column of each row.
- It checks two conditions:
  1. If the first row has all the same color and it is different from the last row, it prints "NO".
  2. If the first column has all the same color and it is different from the last column, it prints "NO".
  3. Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Issues in the Program:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it only checks the first and last rows and columns for uniformity. However, there can be other configurations where it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color, which this program does not catch. For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are the same but there are different colors in between that cannot be changed using the given operation.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the provided program is **not** correct for all cases. It fails to consider configurations where the first and last rows or columns are the same, but there are other rows or columns with different colors that cannot be changed.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
