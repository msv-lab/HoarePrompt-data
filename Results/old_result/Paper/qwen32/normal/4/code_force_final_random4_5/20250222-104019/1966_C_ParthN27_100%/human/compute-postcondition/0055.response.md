The code snippet `n = len(s)` updates the value of `n` to be the length of the list `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element, `ans` is 1.**
