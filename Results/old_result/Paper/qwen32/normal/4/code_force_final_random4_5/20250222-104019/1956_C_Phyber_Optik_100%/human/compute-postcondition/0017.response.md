Let's break down the given Python code snippet and determine what will be printed based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `n` is 5.
- `j` is 4.
- `sum` is the result of the series computation for the given `n` (though `sum` is not used in the provided print statement, it is mentioned for context).

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **First Argument (`1`)**:
   - The first argument to the `print` function is the integer `1`. This is explicitly given in the code.

2. **Second Argument (`n - j + 1`)**:
   - `n` is 5.
   - `j` is 4.
   - Therefore, `n - j + 1` is `5 - 4 + 1`, which simplifies to `2`.

3. **Third Argument (`*range(1, n + 1)`)**:
   - `n` is 5.
   - `range(1, n + 1)` translates to `range(1, 6)`.
   - `range(1, 6)` generates the sequence of numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, meaning each number in the sequence will be passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.

### Final Output:
- The `print` function will output the values `1`, `2`, followed by the unpacked sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Conclusion:
Output: **1 2 1 2 3 4 5**
