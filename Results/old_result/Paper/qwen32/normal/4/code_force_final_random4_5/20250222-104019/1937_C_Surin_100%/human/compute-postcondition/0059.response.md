Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`.
- `r` is the user's input.
- `prev` is `v1 + 1`.
- `i` is `v1 + 2`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is the largest integer from 1 to `n-1` where the user responded with `'<'`.
- `prev` is set to `v1 + 1`.
- `i` is set to `v1 + 2`.

The print statement formats a string with the values of `v1`, `i`, `v1`, and `prev`.

### Substituting Values:
- The first `{v1}` in the string will be replaced by the value of `v1`.
- The second `{i}` in the string will be replaced by the value of `i`, which is `v1 + 2`.
- The third `{v1}` in the string will again be replaced by the value of `v1`.
- The fourth `{prev}` in the string will be replaced by the value of `prev`, which is `v1 + 1`.

### Output:
The output will be a formatted string with these values.

Output: **? [v1] [v1 + 2] [v1] [v1 + 1] (where v1 is the largest integer from 1 to n-1 for which the user's response was '<')**
