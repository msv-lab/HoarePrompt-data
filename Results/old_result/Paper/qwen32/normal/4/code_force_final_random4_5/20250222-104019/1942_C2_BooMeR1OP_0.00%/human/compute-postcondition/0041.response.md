The code snippet sorts the list `gaps`. This means that the elements in the list `gaps` are rearranged in ascending order. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is a sorted list of all positive gaps calculated as `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0) - a[i] - 1` for each `i` in the range `[0, x-1]`.**
