Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the given program.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, given the price of one yogurt `a` and the price of two yogurts `b` under a promotion.

### Key Points:
1. **Single Yogurt Purchase**: If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a`.
2. **Multiple Yogurts Purchase**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, we need to consider two scenarios:
     - **Scenario 1 (Regular Price)**: Buying all yogurts at the regular price, which would cost `a * n`.
     - **Scenario 2 (Promotion Price)**: Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price. The cost for this scenario is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
     - The final result should be the minimum of these two scenarios.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program correctly implements the above logic.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read.

2. **Calculation**:
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints `a`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates the cost for both scenarios (`ans1` and `ans2`) and prints the minimum of these two values.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case (2 yogurts, a=5, b=9)**:
   - Regular price: 2 * 5 = 10
   - Promotion price: 9 (1 pair)
   - Minimum: 9

2. **Second Test Case (3 yogurts, a=5, b=9)**:
   - Regular price: 3 * 5 = 15
   - Promotion price: 9 + 5 = 14 (1 pair + 1 single)
   - Minimum: 14

3. **Third Test Case (3 yogurts, a=5, b=11)**:
   - Regular price: 3 * 5 = 15
   - Promotion price: 11 + 5 = 16 (1 pair + 1 single)
   - Minimum: 15

4. **Fourth Test Case (4 yogurts, a=5, b=11)**:
   - Regular price: 4 * 5 = 20
   - Promotion price: 11 * 2 = 22 (2 pairs)
   - Minimum: 20

The program produces the correct output for all test cases.

### Function Summary:
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program:
- For each test case, it computes and prints the minimum cost, where the cost is either `a * n` or `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, depending on the value of `n`.
- If `n` is 1, it simply prints `a`.

### Conclusion:
The function summary aligns with the problem description and the program code. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
