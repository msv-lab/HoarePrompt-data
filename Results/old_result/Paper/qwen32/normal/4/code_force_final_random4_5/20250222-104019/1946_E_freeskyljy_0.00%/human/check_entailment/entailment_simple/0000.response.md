### Reasoning:

The given program aims to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that have specific indices as prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program checks several conditions to ensure the feasibility of such a permutation and then calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial mathematics.

Here's a detailed step-by-step reasoning about the program:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - **L[-1] != R[0]:** If the last prefix maximum index is not equal to the first suffix maximum index, it's impossible to have a permutation where the last element of the prefix is also the first element of the suffix. Hence, the function returns `0`.
   - **L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N:** If the first prefix maximum is not at index `1` or the first suffix maximum is not at index `N`, it's impossible to have a permutation where the smallest element is at the start and the largest element is at the end. Hence, the function returns `0`.
   - **M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and L[-2] == R[1]:** If there are more than one prefix and suffix maximums and the second-to-last prefix maximum is the same as the second suffix maximum, it creates a conflict in the permutation structure. Hence, the function returns `0`.

2. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - **Initial Combination:** `ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`: This calculates the number of ways to choose the positions for the maximum element (which is at `L[-1]` and `R[0]`) and the remaining elements in the prefix.
   - **Handling Prefix Maximums:** If there are more than one prefix maximums, the program iterates backwards from `L[-1] - 1` to `2` and multiplies `ans` by the number of available positions for each prefix maximum, adjusting the number of available positions (`nums_left`) accordingly.
   - **Handling Suffix Maximums:** If there are more than one suffix maximums, the program iterates forwards from `R[0] + 1` to `N-1` and multiplies `ans` by the number of available positions for each suffix maximum, adjusting the number of available positions (`nums_left`) accordingly.

3. **Final Output:** The function returns the final computed value `ans` modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum conditions. It checks for impossible scenarios and calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial mathematics. The provided annotated states and the logic align with the problem requirements.

Based on the reasoning above, the program appears to be correct.
