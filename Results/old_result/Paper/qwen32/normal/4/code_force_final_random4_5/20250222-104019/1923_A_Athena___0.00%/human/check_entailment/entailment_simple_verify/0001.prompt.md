You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to move chips on a ribbon such that all chips are in a contiguous block with no free cells between them. The operations allowed are to move any chip to the closest free cell to its left. The goal is to determine the minimum number of such operations required.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` of length `n` representing the ribbon.

2. **Trimming Free Cells**:
   - It removes leading and trailing free cells (0s) from the list `a`. This is done by popping elements from the front and back of the list `a` while they are 0.

3. **Counting Operations**:
   - It then counts the number of free cells (0s) remaining in the trimmed list `a`. Each free cell represents a potential operation needed to move a chip to the left of it.

4. **Output**:
   - The count of free cells is printed as the result for each test case.

### Issues and Correctness:
- **Trimming Free Cells**: The program correctly trims leading and trailing free cells since these do not affect the minimum number of operations needed to move chips into a contiguous block.
  
- **Counting Operations**: The key part of the program is the counting of free cells within the trimmed list. However, the number of free cells does not directly translate to the minimum number of operations required. The operations are needed to move chips to the left of each free cell, but the order and the position of chips relative to each other also matter.

- **Incorrect Logic**: The program assumes that the number of free cells in the trimmed list is the minimum number of operations. This is incorrect because:
  - If there are multiple free cells between chips, moving a chip to the first free cell to the left does not necessarily minimize the total number of operations.
  - The program does not consider the optimal way to move chips to form a contiguous block.

### Correctness:
Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a contiguous block. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
