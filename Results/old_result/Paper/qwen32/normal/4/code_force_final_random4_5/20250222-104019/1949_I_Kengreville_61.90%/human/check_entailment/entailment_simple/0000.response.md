### Reasoning:

The program provided is designed to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii of disks such that the disks that were initially tangent remain tangent, no two disks overlap, and the sum of all radii decreases. The approach involves using a depth-first search (DFS) to explore connected components of tangent disks and checking if it is possible to adjust the radii within each component.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of disks `n` and the details (x, y, r) for each disk.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to keep track of visited nodes and coefficients for each disk.
   - An empty list `nodes` is used to store the indices of disks in the current connected component being explored.

3. **DFS Function:**
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore all disks that are tangent to the current disk `i`.
   - If a disk `j` is tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii), it is marked as visited, and the coefficients `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated accordingly.
   - The DFS continues recursively for all tangent disks.

4. **Connected Components:**
   - The main loop in `func_1` iterates through all disks and initiates a DFS for each unvisited disk to explore all connected components of tangent disks.
   - For each connected component, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` values.
   - If the sum of `coef1` values in any connected component is non-zero, it indicates that it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of all radii decreases.

5. **Output:**
   - If there is at least one connected component with a non-zero sum of `coef1` values, the program outputs "YES".
   - Otherwise, it outputs "NO".

### Correctness Analysis:
The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to adjust the radii of the disks based on the given conditions. The use of DFS ensures that all tangent disks are considered, and the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if a valid adjustment is possible. The logic aligns with the problem requirements and handles the constraints effectively.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided logic and the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
