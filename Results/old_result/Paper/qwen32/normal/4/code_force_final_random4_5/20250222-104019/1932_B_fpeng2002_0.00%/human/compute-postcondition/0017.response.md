The code snippet `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `nums`. This means that the previous list stored in `nums` is replaced with a new list of integers based on the input.

The other variables `start_year`, `num_tests`, `n`, and `x` are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`start_year` is the value computed after processing all elements in the `nums` list according to the given formula, `num_tests` is a positive integer less than its previous value, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, and `x` is the last index of the new `nums` list.**
