The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not adjusted, so we need to increment `i` by 1 to proceed to the next iteration. The values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `t` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1**
