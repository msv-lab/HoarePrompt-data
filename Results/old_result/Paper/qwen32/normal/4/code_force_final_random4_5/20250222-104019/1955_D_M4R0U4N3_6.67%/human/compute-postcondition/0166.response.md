The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `extra`. Given the initial state, `j` is `j + 1` (which implies `j` has been incremented by 1), and `m` must be greater than `j`.

After executing the code, the set `extra` will include the element `a[j]`. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged according to the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `m` must be greater than `j`, `extra` includes `a[j]`.**
