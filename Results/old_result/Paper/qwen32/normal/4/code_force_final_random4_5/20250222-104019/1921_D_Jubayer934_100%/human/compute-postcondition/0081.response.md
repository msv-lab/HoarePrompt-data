Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is either -1 or 1 depending on the condition, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the new input, sorted in descending order, `i` is 1. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.**
