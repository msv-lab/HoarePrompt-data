Let's carefully analyze the problem, the program, and the annotations to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Grid and Diagonals**:
    - The square grid is of size `n x n`.
    - There are `4n - 2` diagonals in total:
        - `n` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right.
        - `n` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
        - Two of these diagonals are the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the grid.

2. **Objective**:
    - Sasha wants to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

3. **Key Observations**:
    - If `k <= 2 * n`, then it is possible to color cells in a way that each colored cell covers two diagonals (one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left). Thus, the minimum number of cells needed is `ceil(k / 2)`.
    - If `k > 2 * n`, then some diagonals will not be able to share a cell with another diagonal. Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is `k // 2 + 1` because we need to ensure that the remaining diagonals each get at least one unique cell.

### Program Analysis

Let's verify the provided program against the above analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cells**:
    - If `k == 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because only one cell is needed to cover one diagonal.
    - If `k <= 2 * n`, the program correctly calculates `ceil(k / 2)` using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
    - If `k > 2 * n`, the program correctly calculates `k // 2 + 1`.

### Annotations

The annotations describe the state of the program at key points and confirm the logic:
- **State before function call**: `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^8` and `1 <= k <= 4n - 2`.
- **State after processing each test case**: The program correctly outputs `1` if `k == 1`, `math.ceil(k / 2)` if `k <= 2 * n`, and `k // 2 + 1` if `k > 2 * n`.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
    - Input: `3 4`
    - Calculation: `k = 4`, `k <= 2 * 3` → `ceil(4 / 2) = 2`
    - Output: `2`
    - Correct.

2. **Example 2**:
    - Input: `3 3`
    - Calculation: `k = 3`, `k <= 2 * 3` → `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`
    - Output: `2`
    - Correct.

3. **Example 3**:
    - Input: `3 10`
    - Calculation: `k = 10`, `k > 2 * 3` → `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`
    - Output: `6`
    - Correct.

4. **Example 4**:
    - Input: `3 9`
    - Calculation: `k = 9`, `k > 2 * 3` → `9 // 2 + 1 = 5`
    - Output: `5`
    - Correct.

5. **Example 5**:
    - Input: `4 7`
    - Calculation: `k = 7`, `k > 2 * 4` → `7 // 2 + 1 = 4`
    - Output: `4`
    - Correct.

6. **Example 6**:
    - Input: `7 11`
    - Calculation: `k = 11`, `k > 2 * 7` → `11 // 2 + 1 = 6`
    - Output: `6`
    - Correct.

7. **Example 7**:
    - Input: `2 3`
    - Calculation: `k = 3`, `k > 2 * 2` → `3 // 2 + 1 = 2`
    - Output: `2`
    - Correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all cases based on the logic derived from the problem analysis. Therefore, the program is correct.
