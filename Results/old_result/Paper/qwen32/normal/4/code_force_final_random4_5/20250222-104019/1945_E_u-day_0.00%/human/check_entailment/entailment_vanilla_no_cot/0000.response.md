Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the required solution. Here are the key issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in the program is not correctly set up to find the correct position `l` such that `p[l] == x` after performing at most two swaps. The current implementation does not guarantee that after the binary search, `p[l]` will be equal to `x`.

2. **Handling of Swaps**: The program does not actually perform any swaps if they are needed. It only checks if the target value `x` can be found at the position `l` after a single binary search pass. If `x` is not found at `p[l]`, it suggests a single swap but does not perform it or check if it leads to the correct result.

3. **Output Format**: The program does not correctly format the output for all cases. It only handles the case where no swaps are needed or one swap is suggested, but it does not ensure that two swaps are used if necessary to achieve the goal.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
- Perform up to two swaps to ensure that the binary search will end with `p[l] == x`.
- Output the number of swaps and the indices involved in the swaps.

The solution requires a more strategic approach to determine the best swaps to perform to ensure the binary search ends with the correct result.
