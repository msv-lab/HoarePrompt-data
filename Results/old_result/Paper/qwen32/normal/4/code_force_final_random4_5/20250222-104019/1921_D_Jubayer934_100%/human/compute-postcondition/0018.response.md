The value of `temp` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `i + 1`, so `temp` will also hold the value `i + 1`. The initial state of `i` being `i + 1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `temp` is `i + 1`**
