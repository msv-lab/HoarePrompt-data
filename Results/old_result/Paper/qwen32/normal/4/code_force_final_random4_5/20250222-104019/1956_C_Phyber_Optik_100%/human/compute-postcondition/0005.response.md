The provided code snippet modifies the `sum` variable based on the value of `i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined, we can assume that `i` should be a variable that is part of a loop or some other context that is not provided. For the sake of this task, let's assume `i` is a loop variable that iterates from 1 to `n`.

Given that `i` is not specified, we can't provide a specific value for `sum` after the operation. However, we can describe the transformation that occurs to `sum` in terms of `i`.

The expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1))` simplifies to `2*i - 1`. Therefore, the operation `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` can be rewritten as `sum += (2*i - 1) * i`, which simplifies further to `sum += 2*i*i - i`.

Thus, if `i` is a specific value, `sum` will be updated accordingly. However, since `i` is not defined, we can express the new value of `sum` in terms of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer that must be at least 2; `sum` is `1 + (2*i*i - i)` where `i` is the loop variable.**
