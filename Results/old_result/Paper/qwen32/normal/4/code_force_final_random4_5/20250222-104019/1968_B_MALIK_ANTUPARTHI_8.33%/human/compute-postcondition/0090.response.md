Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the new input string, `j` is `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `e` is the value of the input. `k` is `j`.**

In simple terms: The value of `k` is now set to the value of `j`. All other variables retain their previous values.
