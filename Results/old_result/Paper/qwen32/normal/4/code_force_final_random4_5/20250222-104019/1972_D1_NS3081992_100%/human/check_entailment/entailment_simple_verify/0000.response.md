### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Code Analysis:
The main function responsible for solving the problem is `func_15()`. Here is the function again for reference:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Evaluation of the Code:
1. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop condition `i * i <= n + i` is indeed unusual and not immediately clear why it would work. However, let's analyze what the loop is trying to achieve.
   - The loop iterates over values of \(i\) such that \(i \le m\) and \(i^2 \le n + i\), which simplifies to \(i \le n + 1\). This condition effectively restricts \(i\) to be within a reasonable range relative to \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Calculation**:
   - For each \(i\), the code calculates `(n + i) // (i * i)`. This calculation is based on the assumption that for each \(i\), the number of valid \(a\) values can be determined by this expression.
   - The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` is derived from the condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The loop iterates over possible values of \(b\) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

3. **Subtraction of 1**:
   - The final result is `ans - 1`. This subtraction is not immediately clear but can be justified by the way the loop and calculation are set up. The loop might be over-counting by 1, and subtracting 1 corrects this.

#### Validation Using Annotations:
- The annotations provide a detailed description of the program's state at key points, but they do not explicitly verify the correctness of the logic in `func_15()`.
- The annotations confirm that `func_15()` is called for each test case and that the input is read and processed correctly.

#### Example Verification:
- Consider the test case:
  ```
  1
  10 8
  ```
- The expected output is 14. Let's manually verify if `func_15()` produces the correct result:
  - For \(i = 1\), \((n + i) // (i * i) = (10 + 1) // (1 * 1) = 11\).
  - For \(i = 2\), \((n + i) // (i * i) = (10 + 2) // (2 * 2) = 3\).
  - For \(i = 3\), \((n + i) // (i * i) = (10 + 3) // (3 * 3) = 1\).
  - For \(i = 4\), \((n + i) // (i * i) = (10 + 4) // (4 * 4) = 0\).
  - Summing these values gives \(11 + 3 + 1 = 15\).
  - Subtracting 1 gives the final result of 14, which matches the expected output.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code, despite its unusual loop condition and final subtraction, appears to correctly solve the problem for the given test cases. The annotations do not provide evidence to challenge the correctness of the logic in `func_15()`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
