Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `p3`.
Code of the loop:
while y >= x:
    if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
        print(p1 - x + p3)
        break
    else:
        x += 1
        y -= 1
else:
    print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement with `x` remaining 0 and `y` equal to `p3`. Otherwise, `x` is set to 1 and `y` is set to `p3 - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 0, 1, or 2; `y` is 1, 2, or `x + 1`. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is 1 or 2 and `y` is 1 or 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `x` is 1, 2, or 3; `y` is 0, 1, or `x` (and `y` must be at least `x - 1`). In both cases, `y` must be at least `x` or `x - 1` as per their respective conditions.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
