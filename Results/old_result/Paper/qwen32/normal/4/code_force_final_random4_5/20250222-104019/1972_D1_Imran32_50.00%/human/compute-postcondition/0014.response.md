Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m` within the range of 1 to 2,000,000. The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, ensuring that the total sum of all `n` values and the total sum of all `m` values do not exceed 2,000,000. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided integers `n` and `m`.**
