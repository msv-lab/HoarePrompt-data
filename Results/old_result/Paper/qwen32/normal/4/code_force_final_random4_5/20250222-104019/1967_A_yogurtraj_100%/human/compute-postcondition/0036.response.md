Let's analyze the loop and the provided output states to deduce the final output state.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-2` (since the range is `range(0, n - 1)`). In each iteration, the loop checks if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. If this condition is true, it updates `r`, `rem`, `y`, and `k`, and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it updates `k` and `r`.

### Output State after the Loop Executes All Iterations:
If the loop executes all iterations without breaking, it means that for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k` holds true. This implies that `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` in each iteration, and `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]`. After the last iteration, `r` will be equal to the last element of the list `a`, which is `a[n-1]`. The value of `k` will be the initial `k` minus the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-2`. Since the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `rem` remains `0` and `y` remains `0`.

### Final Output State:
- `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 100`.
- `ii` remains `0`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same sorted list of integers.
- `r` is updated to `a[n-1]`.
- `rem` remains `0`.
- `y` remains `0`.
- `k` is reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-2`.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `r` is the last element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, the variable `r` will be the last element of the sorted list `a`. The value of `k` will be reduced by the sum of the differences multiplied by their respective indices plus one. The variables `t`, `ii`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, and `y` will remain unchanged or set to their initial or default values as described.
