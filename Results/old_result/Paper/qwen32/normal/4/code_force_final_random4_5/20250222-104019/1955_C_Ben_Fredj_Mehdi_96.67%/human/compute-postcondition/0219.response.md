The given initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the provided Python code snippet only contains a simple `print('2')` statement. This statement is independent of the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` described in the initial state. Therefore, the value to be printed is explicitly specified in the code.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `a`, `z`, `n`, and `k` but does not affect the `print('2')` statement.
2. The `print('2')` statement directly outputs the string `'2'`.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
