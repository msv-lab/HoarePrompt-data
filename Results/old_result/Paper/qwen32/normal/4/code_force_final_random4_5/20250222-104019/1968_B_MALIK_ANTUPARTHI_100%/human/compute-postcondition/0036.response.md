The code snippet provided reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `b` and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `d` remain unchanged. The value of `e` is still the value of the user input, and the value of `k` is determined by the loop's breaking condition, which is not affected by this input operation. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input, and `k` is the value determined by the loop's breaking condition (either `j + 1` when `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` reaches `c`, or `j` reaches `b - 1`), `i` is `i + 1`.**
