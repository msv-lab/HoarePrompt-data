To determine what will be printed, we need to break down the given formula and understand how the variables interact based on the provided conditions.

Given:
- `t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases minus 2, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 2.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers input from the user.
- The condition of the if statement is satisfied if `b` is less than or equal to `a`.
- The condition of the else statement is satisfied if `b` is greater than `a`.

However, the print statement is outside of any conditional block, meaning it will execute regardless of whether `b <= a` or `b > a`.

The formula inside the print statement is:
```python
int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)
```

Let's break down this formula:
1. **`(b - a) / 2`**: This computes half the difference between `b` and `a`. Since we are using integer division (`int()`), the result will be an integer.
2. **`(b - a + 1)`**: This is the difference between `b` and `a` plus one.
3. **`(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1)`**: This part of the formula calculates the sum of all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive) if `b >= a`. This is derived from the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
4. **`a * n`**: This part of the formula multiplies `a` by `n`.

Combining these parts, the formula calculates the sum of all integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive) if `b >= a`, and then adds `a * n` to this sum.

If `b <= a`, the formula still executes, but the sum of integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive) would be just `a` (since the range is empty or invalid in the context of summing from a larger to a smaller number).

Thus, the formula is:
- **If `b >= a`**: It calculates the sum of integers from `a` to `b` and adds `a * n`.
- **If `b <= a`**: It calculates `a * n` because the sum part is effectively zero or invalid.

Given that the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n) (where the expression calculates the sum of integers from a to b (inclusive) and adds a * n if b >= a, otherwise it calculates a * n)**
