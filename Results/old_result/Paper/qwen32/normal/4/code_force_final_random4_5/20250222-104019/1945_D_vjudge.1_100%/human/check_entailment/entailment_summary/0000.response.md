### Reasoning:

The problem requires Kirill to determine the minimum number of coins he needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. Kirill can swap positions with people ahead of him, paying `a_j` coins to the person at position `j` and `b_k` coins to each person between `j` and `i`.

The provided program defines a function `func_1` which calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Calculate `c` array**: This array holds the minimum cost between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each position `i`. This is because if Kirill swaps with person `i`, he pays `a[i]` coins, and if he swaps past person `i`, he pays `b[i]` coins to each person between `j` and `i`.

2. **Calculate `suff` array**: This array holds the suffix sum of the `c` array, which means `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum costs from position `i` to the end of the queue. This helps in calculating the total cost if Kirill swaps with a person at position `i`.

3. **Determine the minimum cost**: The program then iterates through the first `k` positions (where `k = m` in the problem statement) and calculates the cost of Kirill moving to position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`. It keeps track of the minimum cost found.

### Analysis:

The program's logic seems correct based on the problem description. It calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions by considering the cost of swapping with each person up to position `m-1` and the sum of the minimum costs for the remaining people in the queue. 

The logic correctly accounts for the cost of swapping directly with a person (`a[i]`) and the cost of moving past a person (`b[i]`). The suffix sum array `suff` helps in efficiently calculating the total cost for each possible swap position.

### Conclusion:

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described above and matches the expected behavior for the provided example, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
