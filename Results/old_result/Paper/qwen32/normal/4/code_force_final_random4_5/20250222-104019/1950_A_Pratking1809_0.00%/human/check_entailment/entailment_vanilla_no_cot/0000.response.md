Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because of the placement of the `else` statement. The `else` statement is currently associated with the second `if` statement (`if a < b > c:`), which means it will print "NONE" whenever the condition for a peak is not met, even if the condition for a stair is met. This results in "NONE" being printed in cases where it should print "STAIR".

To fix this, the `else` statement should be associated with the entire block of conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK". This can be achieved by using `elif` for the second condition. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.
