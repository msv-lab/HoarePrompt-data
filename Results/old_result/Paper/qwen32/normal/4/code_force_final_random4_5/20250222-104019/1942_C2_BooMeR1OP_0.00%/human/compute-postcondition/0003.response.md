The code sorts the list `a`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1.**
