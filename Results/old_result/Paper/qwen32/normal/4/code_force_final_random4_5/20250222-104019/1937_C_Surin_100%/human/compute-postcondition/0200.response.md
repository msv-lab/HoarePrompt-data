The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. The value of `r` (and `r2` if applicable) does not affect the loop condition directly but influences the value of `prev`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is already incremented from the previous iteration), and `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the start of the previous iteration, it became `x+1` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` should be `x+2` and `n` must be greater than `x+2`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**. 

Since we know `i` is already `x+1` from the previous iteration, we simply need to state that `i` is now `x+2` (which is `i+1` from its current value at the start of this explanation).

State: **`n` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

Simplifying, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is greater than `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
