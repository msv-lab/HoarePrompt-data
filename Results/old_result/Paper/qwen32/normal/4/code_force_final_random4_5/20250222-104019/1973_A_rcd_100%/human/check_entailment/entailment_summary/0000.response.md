Let's break down the program and verify its correctness based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

### Program Explanation
The program iterates over `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` where `p1 <= p2 <= p3`. It then checks if the total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because an odd total score is not possible with the given scoring system (where scores can only be 0, 1, or 2 per game).

If the total score is even, the program proceeds to determine the maximum number of draws. It does this by considering two main cases:
1. If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it means the highest score `p3` could be the sum of all wins and draws involving the player with score `p3`. In this case, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because `p3` could have drawn with `p1` and `p2` all the time.
2. Otherwise, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws `x` and `y` such that the conditions `p1 - x <= p2 - y` are satisfied. This loop iterates to find a balance between the scores that could be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.

### Verification Against Test Cases
Let's verify the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total score is `0`, which is even.
   - Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, the loop is not entered, and the program prints `0` (no draws).

2. **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total score is `2`, which is even.
   - Since `p3 < p1 + p2`, the loop finds that `x = 0` and `y = 1` satisfy the condition, and the program prints `1` (one draw).

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total score is `3`, which is odd.
   - The program prints `-1` (impossible scores).

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total score is `4`, which is even.
   - Since `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2 = 2` (two draws).

5. **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total score is `9`, which is odd.
   - The program prints `-1` (impossible scores).

6. **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total score is `12`, which is even.
   - The loop finds that `x = 1` and `y = 4` satisfy the condition, and the program prints `p1 - x + p3 = 6` (six draws).

7. **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total score is `12`, which is even.
   - The loop finds that `x = 0` and `y = 1` satisfy the condition, and the program prints `p1 - x + p3 = 2` (two draws).

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the given test cases and adheres to the problem description and constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
