The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `x`. This means the values of `a` and `x` will be updated based on the input, while other variables will remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the input values.

Given the initial state, the variables `a` and `x` will be reassigned to the values provided by the input. The other variables (`bx`, `ax`, `cx`, `t`, `n`, `r`) will retain their initial states unless they are modified by subsequent code (which is not included in the provided snippet).

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` remains 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains the value `x`, `t` is at least 1 and `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `n` is `n - 1`, `r` contains elements as per its initial condition or previous updates.**
