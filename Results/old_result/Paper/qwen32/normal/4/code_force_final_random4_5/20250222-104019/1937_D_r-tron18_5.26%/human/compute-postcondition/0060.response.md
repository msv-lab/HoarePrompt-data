The code snippet provided updates the value of `el` by assigning it the character at the `i`-th index of the string `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly dependent on `el`. Since `i` is updated to `i - 1` before this assignment, the new value of `el` will be the character at the position `i - 1` in `s1`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` and `zr` remain unchanged or are recalculated; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`.**

In simpler terms, `el` is now the character at index `i - 1` in the string `s1`, and all other variables retain their previous values or will be recalculated based on the new value of `el`.
