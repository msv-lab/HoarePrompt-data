The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one for the loop to execute. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0 since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`. Given that the state before the loop starts specifies that `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^4`, the loop will definitely execute without any need to adjust `n`.

The values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` are not directly related to the execution of the for loop itself, but rather to the logic within the loop body, which is omitted. Therefore, we do not need to adjust these variables for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` in the range 1 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', or 0 if `func_1` never returns '<'; `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`, `i` is 0**
