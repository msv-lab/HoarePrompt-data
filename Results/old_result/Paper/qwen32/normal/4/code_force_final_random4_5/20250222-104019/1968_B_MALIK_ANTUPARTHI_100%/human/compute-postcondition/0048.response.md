The code snippet `k = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `k`. Therefore, the value of `k` changes to whatever the value of `j` is at the time of execution. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `k` is the value of `j`, and the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`.**
