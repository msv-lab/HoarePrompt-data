To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
2. `i` is set to 2.
3. `n` and `k` are new input integers.
4. There is a conditional statement that modifies `k`:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, `k` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(n - 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement directly prints the value of `n - 1`.
- The value of `n` is an input integer, and there is no modification to `n` in the given code snippet.
- The value of `k` is irrelevant to the print statement as it does not involve `k` in any way.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `n - 1`.

### Output:
Output: **n - 1 (where n is the input integer)**
