The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then creates a list `s` from these integers. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code. The input integer `n` likely represents the number of integers that will be in the list `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
