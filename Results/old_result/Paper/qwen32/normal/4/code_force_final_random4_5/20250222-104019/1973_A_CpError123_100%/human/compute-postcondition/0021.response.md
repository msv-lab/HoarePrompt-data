Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the three integers from the new input with their sum being odd, `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`, `y` is `a + b`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
