The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged unless the condition in the description is met, which is not addressed in this specific code snippet. Therefore, we only update `ans` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `temp` is `i` if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, otherwise `temp` remains -1, `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the new input, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1.**
