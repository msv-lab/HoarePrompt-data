The code snippet `fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` calculates the difference between the cumulative counts of '>' characters at the indices `zr + 1` and `zr` in the `preOne` list. This value is then assigned to the variable `fi`.

Given the initial state, the variables `preOne`, `zr`, and `fi` are the ones that are directly affected by this code snippet. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element potentially removed; `suffZero` is adjusted based on the value of `el`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` and possibly at index `n-2` where they are calculated based on the conditions involving `el`, `ol`, and `zr`; `i` is `i - 1`; `el` is updated to `s1[i - 1]`; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is 2 * suffZero[-1]; `oneInd` is calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

In simpler terms, `fi` now holds the difference in cumulative counts of '>' characters between the indices `zr + 1` and `zr` in the `preOne` list. All other variables retain their previous values.
