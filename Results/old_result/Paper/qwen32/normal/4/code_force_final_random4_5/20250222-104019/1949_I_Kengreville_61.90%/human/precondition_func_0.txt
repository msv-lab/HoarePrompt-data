n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, x, y, and r are lists of integers where x[i], y[i] are the coordinates of the center of the i-th disk (-10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9), and r[i] is the radius of the i-th disk (1 <= r[i] <= 10^9). visited, coef0, and coef1 are lists of length n initialized with None. nodes is an initially empty list.
