The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length m read from the input; `i` is 1. If `j` is less than `m` (indicating a match was found such that `b[j] == a[0]`), `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `m` and `k` is set to 0, indicating no match was found.**
