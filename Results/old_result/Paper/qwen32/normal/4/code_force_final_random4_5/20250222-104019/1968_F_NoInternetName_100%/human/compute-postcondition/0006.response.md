The code snippet provided appends a new element to the list `x`. This new element is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element of `x` and the variable `i`. Given the initial state, `x` is `[0]`, so `x[-1]` is `0`. Therefore, the new element appended to `x` is `0 ^ i`.

Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we can only express the new element in terms of `i`. The new state of `x` will be `[0, 0 ^ i]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list returned by `func_1(int)` and must contain at least one element, `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, 0 ^ i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]`**.
