Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `n - 1`. In both cases, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**
