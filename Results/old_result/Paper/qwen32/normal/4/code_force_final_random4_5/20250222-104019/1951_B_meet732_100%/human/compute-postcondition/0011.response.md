The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index, and `n` is the length of the list of integers for the current test case. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` is some value, say `i = j`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `j + 1`.

State: **`a` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `x` is the value of `a[k]` for the current test case. `ind` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains empty. If `c` is 2, then the program executes the if part; otherwise, it does nothing. `i` is `j + 1`** (where `j` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration)
