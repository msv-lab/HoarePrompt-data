The `print('9')` statement in the given code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `'9'`. The value to be printed is explicitly given within the statement and does not depend on any variables or conditions defined in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- The initial state provides several conditions and values for variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'9'`.

Output: **9**
