Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2` and at least 1; `x` and `y` are such that `y >= x`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decremented by 1, so the condition `y >= x + 1` changes to `y >= x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
