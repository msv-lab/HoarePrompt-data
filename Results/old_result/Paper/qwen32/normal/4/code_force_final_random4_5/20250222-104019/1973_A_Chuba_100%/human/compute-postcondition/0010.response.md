The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `v`. This means that `v` will now contain the integers provided in the input.

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The conditions on `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged by the code snippet.

The output state will reflect the new value of `v` as a list of integers derived from the input, while `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` retain their original values and constraints.

Output State: **`t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `v` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
