Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Total Points Calculation**: The total points awarded in all games must be even. This is because each game awards a total of 2 points (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each player in case of a draw).
2. **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws is determined by the total points and the scores of the players. If the total points are `T`, then the maximum number of draws is `T // 2` because each draw awards 2 points.
3. **Constraints on Player Scores**: The scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must fit into a scenario where the total points are even and the scores can be achieved through valid game results.

### Program Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases and the scores for each test case.
- **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it outputs `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total number of points from games.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum possible number of draws as `(a + b + c) // 2` and compares it with `a + b` (the sum of the two lower scores). The logic here is that the maximum number of draws cannot exceed the sum of the two lower scores because each draw involves two players and the highest score `c` cannot be solely achieved through draws.
- **Output**: The program outputs the minimum of `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b`, which correctly represents the maximum number of draws possible under the given constraints.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example inputs:
1. **Input**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: `0`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws: `0 // 2 = 0`.
   - Output: `0` (Correct).

2. **Input**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: `2`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws: `2 // 2 = 1`.
   - Output: `1` (Correct).

3. **Input**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: `3`, which is odd.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct).

4. **Input**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: `4`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws: `4 // 2 = 2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct).

5. **Input**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: `9`, which is odd.
   - Output: `-1` (Correct).

6. **Input**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: `12`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws: `12 // 2 = 6`.
   - Output: `6` (Correct).

7. **Input**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: `12`, which is even.
   - Maximum draws: `12 // 2 = 6`, but `a + b = 2`, so the maximum possible draws is `2`.
   - Output: `2` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
