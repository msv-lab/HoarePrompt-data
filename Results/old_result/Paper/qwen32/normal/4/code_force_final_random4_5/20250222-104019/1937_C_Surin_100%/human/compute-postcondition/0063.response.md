To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state provided:

1. **`n`**: This is a positive integer greater than 1.
2. **`g`**: This is explicitly set to 0.
3. **`v1`**: This is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`. This value is determined by some prior interaction, but for the purpose of this task, we know it is an integer between 1 and `n-1`.
4. **`r`**: This is the user's input, which is not explicitly defined in terms of value here but is mentioned in the context of determining `v1`.
5. **`prev`**: This is set to `v1 + 1`.
6. **`i`**: This is set to `v1 + 2`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```
We need to substitute the values of `i` and `prev` into the string.

- `i` is `v1 + 2`
- `prev` is `v1 + 1`

Thus, the print statement will output:
```python
f'? {v1 + 2} {v1 + 2} {v1 + 1} {v1 + 1}'
```

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? [v1 + 2] [v1 + 2] [v1 + 1] [v1 + 1] (where v1 is the largest integer i (from 1 to n-1) for which the user's response was '<')**
