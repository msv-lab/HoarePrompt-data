In the given task, the for loop iterates over the range of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are mentioned but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(int(input()))` will generate numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `t`. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
