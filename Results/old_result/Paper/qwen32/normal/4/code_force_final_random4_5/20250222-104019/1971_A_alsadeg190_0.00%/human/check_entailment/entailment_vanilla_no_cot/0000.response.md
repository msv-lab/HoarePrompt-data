Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it prints the larger number first and the smaller number second in the `if x > y` block, which is the opposite of what is required. It should print the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value for each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)

# or more simply using min and max functions
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
```

The second version of the corrected program is more concise and leverages Python's built-in `min` and `max` functions to achieve the desired result.
