The code modifies the value of `start_year` based on its current value, the value of `nums[x]`, and the updated value of `x`. The value of `x` is initially given as `x + 1`, and then it is used to index into the `nums` array. The new value of `start_year` is calculated as `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

Output State: **`x` is `x + 1`; `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1]`**.
