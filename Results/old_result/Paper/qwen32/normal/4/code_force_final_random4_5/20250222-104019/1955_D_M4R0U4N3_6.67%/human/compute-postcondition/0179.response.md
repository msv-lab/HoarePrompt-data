Postcondition: **`done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed, excluding `old` if `old` was in `done`. `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed, including `old` if `old` was in `done`. `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, and `extra` does not include `old` if `old` was originally in `extra`. `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. `m` must be less than `n`. `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.**
