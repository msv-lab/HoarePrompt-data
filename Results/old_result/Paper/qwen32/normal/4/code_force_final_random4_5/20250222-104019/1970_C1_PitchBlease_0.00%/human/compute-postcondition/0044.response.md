Postcondition: **`start` and `target` remain unchanged, `tree` remains unchanged, `queue` has one less node, `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` except possibly `neighbor`, `current` is a key in `tree` and `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `dist` is the distance associated with the `current` node if it was part of a tuple, otherwise it is the node itself, and `neighbor` is not in `visited`.**
