Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are non-empty strings provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 2; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`. If `vt` is 0, then `vt` is set to 1, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is not 0, then `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**
