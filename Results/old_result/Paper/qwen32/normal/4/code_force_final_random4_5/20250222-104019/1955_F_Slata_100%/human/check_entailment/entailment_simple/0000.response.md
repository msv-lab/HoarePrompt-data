### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to leave sequences where the XOR of the numbers is zero. Here's how the given formula works:

1. **Counting Even and Odd Occurrences:**
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs of each type of number (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s). Each pair of identical numbers results in a zero XOR contribution.
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2` counts the number of leftover single numbers (1s, 2s, 3s) after pairing.

2. **Handling Leftovers:**
   - If there are three leftover single numbers (`a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`), the XOR of these three numbers can be zero (e.g., 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0). Hence, the additional term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` ensures that Bob can win in this case.
   - If there are fewer than three leftovers, the XOR of the remaining numbers will be non-zero, and Alice wins.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **First Example:**
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `1//2 + 1//2 + 1//2 + 0//2 + int(1%2 + 1%2 + 1%2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Result: `1` (Bob wins once when no numbers are removed).

2. **Second Example:**
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `1//2 + 0//2 + 1//2 + 2//2 + int(1%2 + 0%2 + 1%2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`
   - Result: `1` (Bob wins once if Eve removes one one and one three).

3. **Third Example:**
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `2//2 + 2//2 + 2//2 + 0//2 + int(2%2 + 2%2 + 2%2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`
   - Result: `3` (Bob wins three times).

4. **Fourth Example:**
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `3//2 + 3//2 + 2//2 + 0//2 + int(3%2 + 3%2 + 2%2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3`
   - Result: `3` (Bob wins three times).

5. **Fifth Example:**
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `0//2 + 9//2 + 9//2 + 9//2 + int(0%2 + 9%2 + 9%2 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 12`
   - Result: `12` (Bob wins twelve times).

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly computes the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case based on the provided logic.
