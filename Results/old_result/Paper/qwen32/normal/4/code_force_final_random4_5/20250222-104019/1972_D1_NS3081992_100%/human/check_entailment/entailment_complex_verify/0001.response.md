### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
    - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
    - The condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) implies that \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
    - The analysis correctly deduces that the condition can be simplified to checking pairs where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) or \(a\) and \(b\) are small integers that satisfy the equation.

2. **Program Analysis**:
    - The provided program includes several utility functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` are relevant to solving the problem.
    - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.
    - `func_15` reads \(n\) and \(m\), initializes `ans` to 0, and iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) (approximately). For each \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i \cdot i} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`, and finally returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
    - The logic in `func_15` does not correctly account for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).
    - The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic to count the pairs is incorrect.
    - The correct approach involves iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition directly or using a more efficient mathematical approach.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided program is incorrect. The logic in `func_15` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
