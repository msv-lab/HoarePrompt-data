The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or the conditions outside of the loop. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the program execution.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.**
This means that the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
