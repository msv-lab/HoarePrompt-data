The code snippet sets the variable `temp` to -1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is a list of `min(n, i+1)` absolute differences, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, and `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.**
