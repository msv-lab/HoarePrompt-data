The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts those parts to integers, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, `x` and `y` are integers between 0 and 99, `n` must be greater than 0, and `result` is an empty list. The only variables affected by this code are `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `n` must be greater than 0, `result` is an empty list.**
