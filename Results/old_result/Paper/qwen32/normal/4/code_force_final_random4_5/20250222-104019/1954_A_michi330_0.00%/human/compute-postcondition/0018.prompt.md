Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ `m`, `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 50), where `n` is the number of parts of the ribbon, `m` is the number of colors available, and `k` is the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, t, 1):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `itest` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, then the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is greater than or equal to `k`, as specified in the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `itest` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer. If `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, the condition holds true, otherwise, it does not. The values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged regardless of the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `itest` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer. The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is evaluated based on the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. If the condition is true, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
