Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `k` is 0, `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values or expressions as described in the initial state.
