The value of `i` is incremented by 2. Therefore, the new value of `i` is `i + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The preconditions that are still valid include `n` being an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` being strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` being 1, `i < n - 1`, `s1[i + 2]` not equal to `s2[i + 2]` (if applicable), and `s1[i]` not equal to `s1[i + 2]` (if applicable).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `i < n - 1`, `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`.**
