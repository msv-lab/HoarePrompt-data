Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then applying a formula to calculate the minimum cost of purchasing `k` tickets. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly account for the rules of the problem, specifically how the price increases after purchasing tickets on a particular day.

The main issues with the program are:
1. The program does not correctly simulate the price increase after purchasing tickets on a particular day.
2. The formula used to calculate the cost does not reflect the correct logic for the problem.
3. The program does not consider the constraint that a person may purchase no more than `m` tickets per day.

The correct approach to solve this problem is to use a greedy algorithm where you buy tickets on the days with the lowest prices available, taking into account the price increase rule.

Given the execution summary and the provided program, it is clear that the program does not follow the correct logic for solving the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
