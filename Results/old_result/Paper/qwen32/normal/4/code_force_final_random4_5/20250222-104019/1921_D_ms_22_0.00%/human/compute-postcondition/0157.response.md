The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` modifies the variable `ans` by adding the positive value of `item[0]` to it, since `item[0]` is `-difference`. Therefore, `ans` is increased by `difference`.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)` after the smallest element has been removed; `item` is the removed tuple `(-difference, i, index)` with the largest `difference`; `ans` is increased by `difference`.**
