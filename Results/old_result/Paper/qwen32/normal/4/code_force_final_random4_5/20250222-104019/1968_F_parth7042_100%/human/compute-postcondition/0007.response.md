The value of `q` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Given that `index` is 1, `q` is now the integer value of `data[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, and `results`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `a` and `data` are unchanged, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**.
