Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final value of `ans1` will be the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged, and `a` retains its initial sorted order.
