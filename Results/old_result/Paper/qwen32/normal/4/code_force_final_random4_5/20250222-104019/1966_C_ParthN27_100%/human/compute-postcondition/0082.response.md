The provided code snippet takes an input of integers, splits them, and maps them to a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `arr`. This means that the value of `arr` is updated to reflect the new list of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an input integer; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element; If `n` is 2, `ans` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if (n-2) is even, and `ans` is 0 if (n-2) is odd.**
