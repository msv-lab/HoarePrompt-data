The only variable in the loop head is `j`, which is the loop variable, and `m`, which is the range limit. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. The state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` does not affect whether the loop will execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. The initial value of `j` is not specified before the loop starts, but it will be set to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `j` is 0**
