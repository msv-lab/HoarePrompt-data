To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the `print` statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `res` is 110 (though it is not used in the print statement)
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (though it is not used in the print statement)
- `n` must be at least 1
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n` (though it is not used in the print statement)
- `i` is `n-2`

### Print Statement:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Part of the Print Statement: `'2 %d' % i`**
   - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - `i` is defined as `n-2`.
   - Therefore, `'2 %d' % i` will format the string to replace `%d` with the value of `i`, resulting in `'2 [n-2]'`.

2. **Second Part of the Print Statement: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence so that each number is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
   - This means the numbers from 1 to `n` will be printed, separated by spaces.

### Combining Both Parts:
- The first part will print the string `'2 [n-2]'`.
- The second part will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Output Format:
- The output will be a combination of the string `'2 [n-2]'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `i` or the sequence of numbers. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output precisely.

Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 ... n (where n is at least 1 and i is n-2)**
