Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`, `v2` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`, `r` is the user's input response.**

The value of `r` is now the user's input response, while all other variables remain unchanged.
