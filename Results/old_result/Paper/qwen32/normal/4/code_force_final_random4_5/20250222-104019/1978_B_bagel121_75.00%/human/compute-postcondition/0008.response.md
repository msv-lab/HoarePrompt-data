The code snippet assigns a new value to the variable `p2` based on the expression `(n - k) * a`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are used to compute this new value. The other variables (`t`, `b`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**.
