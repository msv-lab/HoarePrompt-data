The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `j`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `t` and `n` must be such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, `p` is the first element of `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of `l`, and `q` equals `i + 1`.**
