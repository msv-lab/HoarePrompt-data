Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the first element of `l`; `q` is the first element of `l`. If `q` equals `i + 1` (which is 1), then `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
