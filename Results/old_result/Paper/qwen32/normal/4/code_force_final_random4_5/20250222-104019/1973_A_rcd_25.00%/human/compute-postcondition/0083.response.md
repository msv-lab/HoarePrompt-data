To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and the given conditions.

The loop iterates as long as `high >= cur`. The variable `cur` starts at `low` and increments by 1 in each iteration until the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met or `cur` exceeds `high`. If the condition is met, the loop prints `p1 - cur + p3` and exits. If the loop completes all iterations without meeting the condition, it prints `p3`.

From the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce the following:
- After the first iteration, `cur` was `low`.
- After the second iteration, `cur` was `low + 1`.
- After the third iteration, `cur` was `low + 2`.

Given that the loop executed 3 times, `high` must be at least `low + 2`. If the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not met by the third iteration, the loop will continue until `cur` exceeds `high` or the condition is met. If the condition is never met, the loop will print `p3` after `cur` exceeds `high`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
1. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met at some point during the loop. In this case, the loop will print `p1 - cur + p3` and exit.
2. The condition is never met, and the loop completes all iterations. In this case, the loop will print `p3`.

Since we do not have specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we cannot definitively determine which of these scenarios occurs. However, based on the loop's behavior and the given outputs, we can conclude the final output state.

If the condition is met at some point, the output will be `p1 - cur + p3`, where `cur` is the value that satisfies the condition. If the condition is never met, the output will be `p3`.

Given the information, the most general output state after all iterations is that the loop either prints `p1 - cur + p3` (where `cur` is the value that satisfies the condition) or `p3` (if the condition is never met).

Since we do not have specific values to determine which scenario occurs, the final output state in the most general form is:

Output State: **p3 or p1 - cur + p3 (where cur is the value that satisfies the condition)**

However, if we assume the loop completes all iterations without meeting the condition (as per the given outputs), the final output state is:

Output State: **p3**
