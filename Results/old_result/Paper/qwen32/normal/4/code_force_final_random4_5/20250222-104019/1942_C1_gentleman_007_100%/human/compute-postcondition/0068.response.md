The value of `j` is decremented by 1, while the values of `dp`, `i`, and the precondition that `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b` remain unchanged. The precondition that `i` is decremented by 1 and must be non-zero, and `j` must be non-zero, still holds, with `j` now being one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. `i` is decremented by 1 and must be non-zero. `j` is decremented by 1 and must be non-zero.**
