Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by user input that must have at least 3 elements, `cnt` is either `math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)` or `1 + math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the third element in the list `a`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
