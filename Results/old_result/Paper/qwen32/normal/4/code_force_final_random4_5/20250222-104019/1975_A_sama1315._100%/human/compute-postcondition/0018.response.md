The code snippet provided is:

```python
result = func_1(a)
```

This line of code updates the variable `result` by assigning it the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the argument `a`.

Given the initial state, `result` is already the value returned by `func_1(a)`, but this line reassigns `result` to the value returned by `func_1(a)` again. Therefore, the value of `result` will be updated to whatever `func_1(a)` returns this time.

Since the state of `a`, `data`, `idx`, `t`, `results`, and `n` do not change due to this line of code, we only need to update the value of `result`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `3 + n + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 1; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1 - n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
