The given code snippet simply increments the variable `ans` by 1. No other variables are modified or used in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the only change in the state is the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `s_a` is `nums[i] + nums[i]`; `s_b` is `s_b + nums[n - i - 1]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is incremented by 1**.

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state except that `ans` has been incremented by 1.
