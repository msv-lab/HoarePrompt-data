The `continue` statement in Python does not change the values of variables; it only affects the control flow by skipping the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and moving to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program's state.

Therefore, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. The current value of `k` is 1.**
