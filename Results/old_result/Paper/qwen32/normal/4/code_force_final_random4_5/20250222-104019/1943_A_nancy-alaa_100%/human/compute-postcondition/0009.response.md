Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is `False`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
