The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state only mentions `t`, which is an input integer and is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.**
