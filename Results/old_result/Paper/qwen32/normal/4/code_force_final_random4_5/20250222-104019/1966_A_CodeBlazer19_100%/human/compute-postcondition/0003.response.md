The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each of these components to an integer, and then stores them in a list `l`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
