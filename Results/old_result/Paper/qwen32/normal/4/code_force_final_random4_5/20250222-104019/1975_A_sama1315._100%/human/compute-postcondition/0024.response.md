The code snippet increments the value of `idx` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial value of `idx` is `3 + n + n + 1`, so after the increment, `idx` becomes `3 + n + n + 1 + n`, which simplifies to `3 + 3*n + 1` or `4 + 3*n`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `4 + 3*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result` and the value of `result` again; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**
