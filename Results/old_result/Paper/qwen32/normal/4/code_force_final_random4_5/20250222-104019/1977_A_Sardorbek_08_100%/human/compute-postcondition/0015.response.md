Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers provided by the input with `b` not equal to `c`. `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`. If `b < c`, then `b` is less than `c`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, and if `b % 2 == c % 2`, `b` and `c` have the same parity; otherwise, they have different parities.**
