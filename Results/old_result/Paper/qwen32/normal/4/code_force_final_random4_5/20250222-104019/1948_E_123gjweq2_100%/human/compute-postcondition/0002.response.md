The code calculates the value of `mid` using the expression `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`. Given the initial state, `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`. Substituting these into the expression for `mid`, we get:

\[ mid = ((right + 1) - (left + 1) + 1) // 2 = (right - left + 1) // 2 \]

This means `mid` is now equal to `(right - left + 1) // 2`.

The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`.**
