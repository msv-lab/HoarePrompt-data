The `print('Bodya')` statement is a simple print statement that outputs the string 'Bodya' regardless of the values of the variables `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `bm`, `sp`, `bp`, `n`, `t`, `a`, `p`, and `i` as described in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Print Statement**: The print statement is `print('Bodya')`.
2. **Understand the Input**: The initial state provides information about several variables (`k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `bm`, `sp`, `bp`, `n`, `t`, `a`, `p`, `i`), but these variables are not used in the print statement.
3. **Determine the Output**: Since the print statement directly outputs the string 'Bodya', the output is simply 'Bodya'.

Output: **Bodya**
