Output State: **`t` is 0, representing that all test cases have been processed; `n`, `a`, and `b` are the last set of integers input from the user for the final test case. The final output is printed based on the last test case's values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values from the last test case, and the final output will be printed based on these values.
