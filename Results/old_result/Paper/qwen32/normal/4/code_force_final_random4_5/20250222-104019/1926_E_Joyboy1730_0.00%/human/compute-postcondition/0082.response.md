The `while` loop in the given program will execute as long as the condition `n` is truthy. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy, and zero is considered falsy. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1
- `n` and `k` are the values provided by the input
- `L` is []
- `pow` is 1
- `tot` is 0

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be a non-zero integer. Since `n` is provided by the input, we need to ensure that the input value for `n` is non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is a non-zero integer; `k` is the value provided by the input; `L` is []; `pow` is 1; `tot` is 0**
