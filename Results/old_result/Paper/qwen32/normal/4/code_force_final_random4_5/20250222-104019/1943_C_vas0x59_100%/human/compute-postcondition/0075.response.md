Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads the number of vertices `n` and the edges of a tree, constructs an adjacency list `u2vs` representing the tree, and then finds the longest path in the tree. It calculates a series of operations based on the longest path and prints the number of these operations followed by the operations themselves in a specific format. The function returns `None`.**
