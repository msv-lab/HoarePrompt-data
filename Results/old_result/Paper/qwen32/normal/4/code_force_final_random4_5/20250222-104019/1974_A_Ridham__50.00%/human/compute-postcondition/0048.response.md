The provided code snippet recalculates the value of `remaining_cells` based on the formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This calculation does not affect any other variables except `remaining_cells` itself.

Here's the breakdown:

- `remaining_cells` is recalculated using the formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `space_x`, `n`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, `result`) retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is greater than 1 and now `n` is `n - 1`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; if `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` where `extra_screen` is `x // 15` if `x` is divisible by 15, or `x // 15 + 1` if `x` is not divisible by 15, and the second element is also `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.**
