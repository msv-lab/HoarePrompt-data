### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The key insight is that if the array can be sorted by such operations, then some rotation of the array should be the sorted version of the array.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program and its correctness:

1. **Concatenation Approach**:
   - The function `func_1(a)` concatenates the array `a` with itself. This is done to simulate all possible rotations of the array `a` within a single array. For example, if `a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`, then `concatenated_a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`.
   - This concatenation allows the program to check every possible rotation of the array in one pass, as each possible rotation of `a` will appear as a contiguous subarray within `concatenated_a`.

2. **Checking for Sorted Subarray**:
   - The program then checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` of length `n` (the original length of `a`) matches the sorted version of `a`. If it does, it means that some rotation of `a` is sorted, and thus, the answer is "Yes".
   - This is a valid approach because if `a` can be split and swapped to achieve a sorted array, then there must be a rotation of `a` that is already sorted.

3. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each one using `func_1(a)`, and collects the results. Finally, it prints all the results.
   - This part of the program correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures that each test case is processed independently.

### Correctness:

The approach is correct because:
- By concatenating the array with itself, we can check all possible rotations of the array in a single pass.
- If any rotation of the array matches the sorted array, then it is possible to sort the array using the allowed operations.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly and efficiently.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

Final: **True**
