The value of `u` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `u` now holds the value that was originally `u - 1`. The list `u2vs` and the integer `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and `0 <= u < n` (after decrementing by 1) and `0 <= v < n-1` still holds, but `u` has been decremented by 1.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the value `v`, and the list at index `v` contains two values `u`, and all other lists remain empty; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is the input integer decremented by 1; `v` is the input integer such that `0 <= v < n-1`.**
