The code snippet provided initializes an empty set named `extra`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, or `done`. The only change is the introduction of the `extra` set, which is also empty.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` is a set of integers read from the input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.**
