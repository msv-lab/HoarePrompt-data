The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are modified, and no calculations or changes are made to the existing variables `a`, `input`, `data`, `idx`, or `t`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
