Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` otherwise `i` is 4, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 otherwise `ar[4]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is 2 if `i` was 3 otherwise `minn` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `same` has been updated to 1. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
