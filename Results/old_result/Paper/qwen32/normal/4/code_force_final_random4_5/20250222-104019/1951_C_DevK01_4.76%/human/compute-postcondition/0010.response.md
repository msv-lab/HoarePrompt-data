Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is `q`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]`. Additionally, `n * m` equals `k`.**
