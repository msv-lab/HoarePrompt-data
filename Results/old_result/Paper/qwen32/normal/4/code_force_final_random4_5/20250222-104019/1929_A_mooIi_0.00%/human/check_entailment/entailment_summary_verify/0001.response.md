Reasoning:
The provided Python program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to rearrange the elements of the array in such a way that the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) from i=2 to n is maximized. To achieve this, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The given program sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a space-separated string, which is not the required output. Instead, the program should calculate the beauty of the array based on the sorted order and print that value.

Here is the step-by-step correct approach:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   a. Read the length of the array.
   b. Read the array elements.
   c. Sort the array.
   d. Calculate the beauty of the array as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   e. Print the calculated beauty.

The given program does not perform these steps correctly and instead prints the sorted array elements as a string, which is not the expected output.

The function summary provided describes the behavior of the given program correctly but does not address the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
