To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `low + 1 < high`. According to this condition, the loop will continue to execute as long as `low + 1` is less than `high`.

Given the current state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1
- `mid` is `(n + 1) // 2`
- `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`
- If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `(n + 1) // 2` and `high` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `low + 1 < high`. Let's analyze the possible values of `low` and `high`:

1. If `arr[mid] > k`, then:
   - `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`
   - `high` is `(n + 1) // 2`
   - We need to ensure that `((n - 1) // 2) + 1 < (n + 1) // 2`

2. If `arr[mid] <= k`, then:
   - `low` is `(n + 1) // 2`
   - `high` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 2`
   - We need to ensure that `((n + 1) // 2) + 1 < ((n - 1) // 2) + 2`

Let's verify these conditions:

1. For `arr[mid] > k`:
   - `((n - 1) // 2) + 1 < (n + 1) // 2`
   - This inequality is generally true for `n > 2` because `(n - 1) // 2` is one less than `(n + 1) // 2`.

2. For `arr[mid] <= k`:
   - `((n + 1) // 2) + 1 < ((n - 1) // 2) + 2`
   - Simplifying, we get `(n + 1) // 2 < (n - 1) // 2 + 1`
   - This inequality is generally not true for `n > 2` because `(n + 1) // 2` is not less than `(n - 1) // 2 + 1`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `arr[mid] > k` so that `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1, `mid` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`, `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
