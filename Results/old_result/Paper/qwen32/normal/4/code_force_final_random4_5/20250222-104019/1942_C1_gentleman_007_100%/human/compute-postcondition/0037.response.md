The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `q`. If `len(q)` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all neighbors of all nodes that were removed from `q` have been visited, and `q` is now empty (since the loop just completed an iteration).

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `q` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to add at least one unvisited node to `q`.

State: **All neighbors of all nodes that were removed from `q` have been visited. Each visited node is marked as `1` in `vis`, and `q` must contain at least one unvisited node.**
