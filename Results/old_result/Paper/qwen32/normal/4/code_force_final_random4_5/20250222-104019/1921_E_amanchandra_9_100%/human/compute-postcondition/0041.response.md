Output State: **`t` is 0; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as initially described.**

**Natural Language Description:**
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` remain unchanged throughout the loop as they are not modified within the loop body.
