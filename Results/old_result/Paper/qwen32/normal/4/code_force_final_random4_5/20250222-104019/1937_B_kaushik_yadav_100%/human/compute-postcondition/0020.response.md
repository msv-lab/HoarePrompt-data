Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[0]` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains the first character of `a`; `i` is 0 if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `i` is 1; `work` is True; `i + 1` is not less than the length of `a` in the if part, and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]` in both parts.**
