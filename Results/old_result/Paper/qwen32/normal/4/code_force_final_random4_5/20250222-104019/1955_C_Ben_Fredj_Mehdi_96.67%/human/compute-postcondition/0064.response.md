To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(len(a))`, we need to understand the state of the variable `a` before the print statement is executed.

From the initial state provided:
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting an input string by spaces and converting each part to an integer.
- `n` and `k` retain their initial values, but no specific values are given for them.
- There are several conditions on the values of `n` and `k`, but none of these conditions directly affect the length of the list `a`.
- The only condition that pertains to `a` is that `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`.

Given this information, the value of `len(a)` depends solely on the number of integers in the input string that was split to form the list `a`. Since the exact input string is not provided, we cannot determine the exact number of integers in `a`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the length of the list `a`.

Output: **len(a) (where len(a) is the number of integers in the input list a)**
