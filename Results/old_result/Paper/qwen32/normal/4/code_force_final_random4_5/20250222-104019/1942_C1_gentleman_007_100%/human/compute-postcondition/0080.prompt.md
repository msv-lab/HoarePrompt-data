Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. The value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(b)`, `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i != 0 and j != 0:
    if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
        i -= 1
    else:
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
        l.append(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. The value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is `len(b) - 1` and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `i` is `len(a) - 1` and `j` is either `len(b)` or `len(b) - 1`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`. If `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`, `j` remains `len(b)` and `l` is an empty list. Otherwise, `j` is `len(b) - 1` and `l` contains `a[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. `i` and `j` must be non-zero. If `dp[i][j]` was equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is decremented by 1. If neither condition holds, both `i` and `j` are decremented by 1, and `l` has an additional element `a[i]` appended to it.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `i` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2. If `dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]`, then `j` is at least 1. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2. Otherwise, `l` is a list that now contains the element `a[i]` appended to it.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
