You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) (0 \(\le\) \( p_i \) \(\le\) 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively. The number of test cases \( t \) satisfies 1 \(\le\) \( t \) \(\le\) 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: The accumulated value of `cnt` after `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on these counts and prints the result. Specifically, it checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd, and if so, increments a counter. It then adds half the value of each count (rounded down) to this counter. The function outputs the final counter value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice, given that Bob wins if the XOR of all remaining numbers is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time, and we need to consider her optimal strategy to maximize Bob's wins.
- The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if for each bit position, the count of numbers having that bit set is even.
- Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in binary are:
  - 1: 001
  - 2: 010
  - 3: 011
  - 4: 100

### Key Observations:
1. **XOR of all numbers:**
   - XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero if and only if:
     - The count of numbers with the least significant bit (LSB) set (i.e., 1 and 3) is even.
     - The count of numbers with the second least significant bit set (i.e., 2 and 3) is even.
     - The count of numbers with the third least significant bit set (i.e., 4) is even.
   - This means that if the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are such that the XOR of all numbers is zero, then Bob wins.

2. **Eve's Strategy:**
   - Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, which means she should aim to create sequences where the XOR is zero as often as possible.
   - If the initial sequence has an odd number of 1s, 2s, and 3s, then removing one of each of these will make their counts even, leading to a zero XOR.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program appears to be trying to count the number of times Bob can win. Let's break down the logic:
- `cnt = 0` initializes the count of Bob's wins.
- `if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:` checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If true, it increments `cnt` by 1, indicating that Bob can win at least once in the initial configuration.
- `for x in a: cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` adds half the count of each number type to `cnt`. This part seems to be counting the number of pairs of each type of number, which would contribute to making the counts even and potentially allowing Bob to win.

### Correctness Check:
The logic in the program seems to be capturing the essence of the problem but might be missing some edge cases or a more precise way to determine Bob's wins.

- The condition `if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:` is correct for checking if the initial sequence allows Bob to win.
- The loop `for x in a: cnt += math.floor(x / 2)` is adding the number of pairs of each type, which is a reasonable approach to count potential wins as numbers are removed.

However, the program does not account for the fact that the presence of 4s (which affect the third bit) can also influence the XOR result. The current logic might be oversimplifying the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program seems to have a logical flaw because it does not fully account for the influence of 4s on the XOR result. The logic for counting Bob's wins should consider all three bits of the numbers.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
