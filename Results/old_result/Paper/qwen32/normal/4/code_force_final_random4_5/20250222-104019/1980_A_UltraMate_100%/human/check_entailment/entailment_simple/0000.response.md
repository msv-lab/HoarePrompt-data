### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold `m` rounds, each containing one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of problems in the bank) and `m` (the number of rounds).
   - It then reads a string `s` of length `n` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counting Existing Problems:**
   - The program uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', the program checks if that level is present in the `Counter` dictionary:
     - If the difficulty level is not present (`i not in hmp`), it means there are no problems of that level, so `m` additional problems are needed for that level.
     - If the difficulty level is present but the count is less than `m` (`hmp[i] < m`), it means there are not enough problems of that level, so `m - hmp[i]` additional problems are needed for that level.
   - The total number of additional problems needed is accumulated in the variable `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of additional problems needed for that test case.

### Verification with Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `s = "BGECDCBDED"`
   - Count of problems: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
   - Missing levels: 'A', 'F'
   - Additional problems needed: `1` for 'A' + `1` for 'F' = `2`
   - Output: `2`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `s = "BGECDCBDED"`
   - Count of problems: `{'B': 2, 'G': 2, 'E': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 2}`
   - Missing levels: 'A', 'F'
   - Additional problems needed: `2` for 'A' + `2` for 'B' + `2` for 'C' + `2` for 'D' + `2` for 'E' + `2` for 'F' + `2` for 'G' - `3` (since 'B', 'G', and 'E' already have 2 problems) = `5`
   - Output: `5`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `s = "BBCDEFFGG"`
   - Count of problems: `{'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
   - Missing levels: 'A'
   - Additional problems needed: `1` for 'A'
   - Output: `1`

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
