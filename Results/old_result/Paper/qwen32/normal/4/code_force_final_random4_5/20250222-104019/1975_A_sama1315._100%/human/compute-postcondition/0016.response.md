The code modifies the list `a` by assigning it the values of the integers from the `data` list starting at index `idx` and ending at `idx + n`. The values from `data` are converted to integers using the `map` function.

Given:
- `a` was initially a list of `n` integers.
- `idx` is `3 + n`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.

After the execution of the code snippet:
- `a` is now a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `3 + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 1; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
