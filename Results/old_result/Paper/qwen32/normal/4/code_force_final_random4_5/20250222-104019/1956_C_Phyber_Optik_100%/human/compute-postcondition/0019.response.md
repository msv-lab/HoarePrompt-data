The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, and `n` is 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 5.

State: **`sum` is the result of the series computation for the given `n`, `n` is 5, `j` is 5**
