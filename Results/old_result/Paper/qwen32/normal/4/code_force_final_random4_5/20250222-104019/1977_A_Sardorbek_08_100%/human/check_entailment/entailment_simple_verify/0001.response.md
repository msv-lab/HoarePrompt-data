Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version to confirm the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis Recap:
1. **Operations**: Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in a move.
2. **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
3. **Key Observations**:
   - If `n < m`, it's impossible because the maximum number of cubes added is `n`.
   - If `n >= m`, it's possible if `n - m` is even. This is because the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves and the target number of cubes must match to balance out the additions and subtractions.

### Program Analysis Recap:
The program logic:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reads `n` (number of moves) and `m` (desired number of cubes).
3. Checks:
   - If `n == m`, prints "YES".
   - If `n < m`, prints "NO".
   - If `n % 2 == m % 2`, prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, prints "No".

### Evaluation Using Annotations:
Let's use the annotations to validate the program's behavior:

- **State before function call**: `t` (number of test cases) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
- **Inside the loop**:
  - `b` and `c` are the values of `n` and `m` for the current test case.
  - `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c` from the last iteration.
  - The conditions are checked in sequence:
    - If `b == c`, it prints "YES".
    - If `b < c`, it prints "NO".
    - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes".
    - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Verification Against Key Observations:
1. **Case `n == m`**:
   - The program correctly prints "YES".
2. **Case `n < m`**:
   - The program correctly prints "NO".
3. **Case `n >= m` and `n % 2 == m % 2`**:
   - The program correctly prints "Yes".
4. **Case `n >= m` and `n % 2 != m % 2`**:
   - The program correctly prints "No".

### Conclusion:
The program logic aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements and the key observations derived from the problem description. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior at each step.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
