Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0, obtained from the input; `c` is an integer obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` is the new input string; `e` is the new input string; `j` is `b - 1` if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise the value of `j` where the loop breaks; `k` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The variable `k` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
