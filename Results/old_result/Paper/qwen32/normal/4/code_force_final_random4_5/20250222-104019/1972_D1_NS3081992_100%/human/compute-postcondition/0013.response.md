Output State: **The program returns `ans - 1`, where `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to `i_final - 1`, and `i_final` is the smallest integer greater than `m` or such that `i * i > n + i`.**

In simple terms, the program calculates a sum based on a specific formula for a range of integers and then subtracts 1 from that sum before returning the result.
