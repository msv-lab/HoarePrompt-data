Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges given as pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and the tree has exactly two leaves, there is a list of t integers (u_1) where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n representing the starting node of the stone, `numbers` is a list containing two elements, which are lists `[num1, num2]` and `[num1, num2]`, `nums` is a list of strings representing the input values. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `t`, the tree, the list of starting nodes, `numbers`, and `nums` remain the same. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
