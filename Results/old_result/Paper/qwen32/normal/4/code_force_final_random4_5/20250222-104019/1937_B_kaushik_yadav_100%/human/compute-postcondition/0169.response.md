The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the first character of `b` is added to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` must be a non-empty string, `b` is the stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 0, `work` is False**.
