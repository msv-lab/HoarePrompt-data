Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        for x in c:
            if x not in a and x not in b:
                print('YES')
                no = False
                break
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tests` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `i` is 0 if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, otherwise `i` is `n`, `slength` is an input integer, and `no` is a boolean. If `no` is True, the program continues as described in the if part. If `no` is False, the program does nothing additional.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string, `i` is 1, `slength` is the new input integer, and `no` is a boolean value. If `no` is True, then `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`. If `no` is False, then `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tests` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the value provided by the input, `i` is 2, and `slength` is the integer value provided by the input. If `no` is True, it indicates that `c` is neither equal to `a` nor `b` and not all elements of `c` are in `a` or `b`. If `no` is False, it indicates that either `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or all elements of `c` are in `a` or `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
