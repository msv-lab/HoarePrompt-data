Functionality: **The function `func_14` takes a list of integers `a`, two positive integers `n` and `m` such that `0 <= n <= len(a)`, and an integer `k`. It returns `1` if `k` is non-negative after subtracting the sum of the differences between `m` and each element in `a` that is less than `m`, for the first `n` elements of `a`. Otherwise, it returns `-1`.**
