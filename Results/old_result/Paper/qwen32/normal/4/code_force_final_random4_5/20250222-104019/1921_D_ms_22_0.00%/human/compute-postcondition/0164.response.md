The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is non-positive, meaning `t` is either 0 or a negative number. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` needs to be greater than 0.

State: **max_heap is empty, tp1 and tp2 have moved towards each other, ans contains the sum of the differences, and t must be greater than 0**
