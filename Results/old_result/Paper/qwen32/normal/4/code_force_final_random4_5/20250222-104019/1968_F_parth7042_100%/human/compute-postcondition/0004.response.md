Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and `data` are unchanged, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**

In natural language, this means that `t` still holds the integer value of the first element of `data`, and the variables `n`, `q`, `a`, and `data` remain unchanged. The variable `index` is still set to 1, and a new variable `results` has been initialized as an empty list.
