Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `q` is greater than or equal to 2; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the elements from `a[1]` to `a[n]` which are `int(data[index - 3])` for each respective iteration; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 11`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each respective iteration; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved; `l` is `int(data[2n + 9])`; `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the insertion point in `v1` for the value `l` found using binary search; `it2` is the insertion point in `v2` for the value `r` found using binary search, minus 1`. If `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `results` includes an additional 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` includes an additional 'NO'**

In natural language: The value of `index` has been incremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
