To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the provided initial state:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
2. `s` is a new string input by the user.
3. `count` is the number of times adjacent characters in `s` have different integer values.
4. `flag` is 0 (indicating there is no pair of adjacent characters where the first character's integer value is less than the second character's integer value).
5. `q` is incremented by 1 (although `q` is not used in the `print` statement, it's mentioned for completeness).

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(count + 1)
```

Given the initial state, we know:
- `count` is the number of times adjacent characters in the string `s` have different integer values.
- The `print` statement will output `count + 1`.

Since the exact value of `count` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the string `s`. The value of `count` depends on the specific string `s` and how many pairs of adjacent characters have different integer values.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be `count + 1`, where `count` is the number of times adjacent characters in the string `s` have different integer values.

Output: **count + 1 (where count is the number of times adjacent characters in the string `s` have different integer values)**
