Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `i` is `n + 1`. If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1, `first` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `first` remains unchanged and `i` is `n + 1`.**
