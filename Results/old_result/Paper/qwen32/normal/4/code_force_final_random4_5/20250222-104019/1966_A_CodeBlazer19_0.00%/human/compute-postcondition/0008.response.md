To determine what will be printed by the `print(k - 1)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. This variable `t` represents the number of test cases, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `k` is the second input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input. However, `l` is not used in the provided code snippet.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is the second input integer.
- The expression `k - 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `k`.
- Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only express the output in terms of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(k - 1)` statement will output the value of `k` minus 1.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the second input integer)**
