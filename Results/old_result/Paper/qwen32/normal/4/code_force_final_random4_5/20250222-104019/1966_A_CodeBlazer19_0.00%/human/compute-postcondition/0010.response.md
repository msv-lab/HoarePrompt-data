The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `k` by reading a new pair of integers from the input. The initial state of `n` and `k` are overwritten, and `l` (the list of integers) is unaffected by this code snippet. The variable `t` (an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and `i` (which is 2) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the split and mapped input.**
