The code snippet `d[p] += d[x]` modifies the value of `d[p]` by adding the value of `d[x]` to it. Given the initial state, `d` is a dictionary with the key `1` mapped to the value `1`. Both `x` and `p` are `1`. Therefore, `d[1]` will be updated to `1 + 1`, which is `2`.

Here are the variables that remain unchanged:
- `A` is a positive integer.
- `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in `g`.
- `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`.
- `visited` is an empty set.
- `r` is `0`.
- `x` is `1`.
- `p` is `1`.
- `d[x]` is less than `A` (now `d[1]` is `2` but the condition `d[x] < A` still holds as long as `A` is greater than `2`).

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < number of vertices in `g`, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 2}`, `r` is `0`, `x` is `1`, `p` is `1`, and `d[x]` is less than `A`.**
