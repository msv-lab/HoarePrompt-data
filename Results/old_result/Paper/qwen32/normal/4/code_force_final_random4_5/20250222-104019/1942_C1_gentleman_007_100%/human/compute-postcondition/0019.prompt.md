Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of `q`, `graph` is a dictionary or adjacency list representing the graph, `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise, `q` has had its front element removed, and `vis[ver]` is 1
Code of the loop:
for node in graph[ver]:
    if not vis[node]:
        q.append(node)
        vis[node] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least one neighbor. If `vis[node]` is `1`, then `node` is appended to `q`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least two neighbors; `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` after the previously processed node. If `vis[node]` was 0, then `node` is appended to `q` and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ver` is a vertex that is a key in `graph` and `graph[ver]` is a list or set containing at least two neighbors; `node` is the next neighbor in `graph[ver]` that has not yet been processed. If `vis[node]` was initially False, then `q` has `node` appended to it and `vis[node]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `q` or `vis[node]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
