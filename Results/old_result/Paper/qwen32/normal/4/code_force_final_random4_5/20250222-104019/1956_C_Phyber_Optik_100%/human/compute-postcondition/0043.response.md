To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve with each iteration.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

The loop iterates `n` times, and `j` takes values from 1 to `n`.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `j` is 6, but the loop should start from 1, so this is an incorrect interpretation. The correct interpretation is that after 1 iteration, `j` becomes 2 (since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time).
- After 2 iterations: `j` is 7, but correctly interpreted, `j` should be 3.
- After 3 iterations: `j` is 8, but correctly interpreted, `j` should be 4.

Thus, `j` should progress from 1 to `n`. After the loop completes, `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop stops when `j` reaches `n + 1`.

The variables `sum`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not modified in the loop body. Therefore, `sum` remains 95, `n` remains the input integer, and `t` remains 1.

The final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
- `sum` is 95
- `n` is the input integer
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `t` is 1

So, the final output state is:

Output State: **sum is 95, n is the input integer, j is n + 1, t is 1.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes, `j` will be one more than the input integer `n`, while `sum` and `t` will remain unchanged at 95 and 1, respectively.
