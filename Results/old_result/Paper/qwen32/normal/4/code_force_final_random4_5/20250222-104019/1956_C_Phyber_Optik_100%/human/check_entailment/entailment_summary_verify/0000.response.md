### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program code and its behavior in detail to determine if it correctly maximizes the sum of the \( n \times n \) matrix using the allowed operations.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix.
- **Operations**:
  - Type 1: Assign a permutation \( p \) to a row \( i \).
  - Type 2: Assign a permutation \( p \) to a column \( i \).
- **Constraints**:
  - Use no more than \( 2n \) operations.
  - The maximum sum can always be achieved in no more than \( 2n \) operations.
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, output the maximum sum and the number of operations.
  - For each operation, specify the type (1 or 2), the row/column index, and the permutation.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
The program calculates the sum using the formula:
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 \times i \]
This formula calculates the sum of the first \( n \) squares multiplied by their respective indices, which is equivalent to:
\[ \text{sum} = \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \]

The operations printed are:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```
These operations do not guarantee that the matrix will be filled in a way that maximizes the sum. Specifically, they fill each row and column with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) in a specific order, but this does not necessarily lead to the maximum sum.

#### Verification with Function Summary:
The function summary states that:
- The function calculates a specific sum based on the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\).
- It prints this sum along with \(2n\) operations.
- It then prints a series of \(n\) lines, each containing a sequence of numbers describing positions in an \(n \times n\) matrix.

However, the operations described do not achieve the maximum sum. Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

### Example Analysis:
For \( n = 2 \):
- The maximum sum should be \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8 \).
- The operations should be:
  - Set the first row to \([1, 2]\).
  - Set the second row to \([2, 3]\).

However, the code will print:
```
7 4
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
This does not achieve the maximum sum of 8.

### Correct Approach:
To achieve the maximum sum, we can use the following strategy:
- Fill the first row with \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\).
- Fill the second row with \([2, 3, \ldots, n, 1]\).
- Continue this pattern for all rows.

This ensures that each element in the matrix is maximized, leading to the maximum possible sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the operations to achieve the maximum sum for the matrix. Therefore, it is incorrect.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
