Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `u` is an integer representing the vertex connected by an edge such that 0 <= u < n (after decrementing by 1); `v` is an integer representing the vertex connected by an edge such that 0 <= v < n.**

Explanation: The value of `u` has been decremented by 1, while `u2vs`, `n`, and `v` remain unchanged.
