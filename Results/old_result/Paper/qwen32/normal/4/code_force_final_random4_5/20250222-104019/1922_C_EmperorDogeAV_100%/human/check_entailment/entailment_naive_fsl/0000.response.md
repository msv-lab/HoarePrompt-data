Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program contains several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key points:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the cost to reach the closest city for each city. However, the logic to determine the closest city is flawed. Specifically, the logic `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back): prog_cities[i] = 1` is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the cost to reach the closest city. Instead, it should calculate the actual distance to the closest city.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the closest city might be at the boundaries (i.e., the first or last city in the list). The logic for determining the closest city should account for these cases properly.

3. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated incorrectly. The prefix sums should accumulate the actual costs to reach the closest cities, not just the number of steps (which is what the current logic does).

4. **Incorrect Indexing**:
   - When calculating the prefix sums, the indexing is incorrect. The prefix sums should be calculated based on the actual distances to the closest cities, not just the number of steps.

5. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly handle queries where the starting city is greater than the ending city. The logic for reversing the prefix sums is incorrect and can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program to illustrate the necessary changes:

```python
def find_closest_cities(cities, n):
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest_cities[i] = abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
        else:
            left_dist = abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])
            right_dist = abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])
            closest_cities[i] = min(left_dist, right_dist)
    return closest_cities

def calculate_prefix_sums(closest_cities, n):
    prefix_sum = [0] * n
    prefix_sum[0] = closest_cities[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + closest_cities[i]
    return prefix_sum

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    closest_cities = find_closest_cities(cities, n)
    pref_sum_f = calculate_prefix_sums(closest_cities, n)
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        cost = pref_sum_f[b - 2] - (pref_sum_f[a - 2] if a > 1 else 0)
        direct_cost = abs(cities[b - 1] - cities[a - 1])
        print(min(cost, direct_cost))
```

This corrected version properly calculates the closest cities, their costs, and handles the queries correctly.
