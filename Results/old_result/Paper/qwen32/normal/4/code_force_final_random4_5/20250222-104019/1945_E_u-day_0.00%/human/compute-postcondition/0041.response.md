To determine the output of the print statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables `low` and `pos` based on the given initial state.

Initial State:
- `low` and `high` are adjacent indices.
- `st` contains all `mid` values calculated during the iterations.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

From the context, it appears that we are dealing with a binary search algorithm or a similar search algorithm where `low` and `high` are indices used to narrow down the search range. Since `low` and `high` are adjacent, it means that after the last iteration, the search range has been reduced to two elements, and `low` points to one of them.

The variable `pos` is not defined in the initial state, but based on common usage in similar contexts, `pos` could be an index that indicates the position of the element `k` if it were found. Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it implies that `k` was not found at the `low` index.

Given the print statement `print(low + 1, pos + 1)`, we need to describe the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`:
- `low + 1` will be the 1-based index corresponding to the `low` index.
- `pos + 1` will be the 1-based index corresponding to the `pos` index. However, since `pos` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of its role in the algorithm.

Since `pos` is not explicitly provided, we can assume it to be either `low` or `high` (or some other value based on the specific algorithm), but we cannot determine its exact value from the given information. However, we can still describe the output format.

Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low + 1 is the 1-based index corresponding to the low index, and pos + 1 is the 1-based index corresponding to the pos index)**
