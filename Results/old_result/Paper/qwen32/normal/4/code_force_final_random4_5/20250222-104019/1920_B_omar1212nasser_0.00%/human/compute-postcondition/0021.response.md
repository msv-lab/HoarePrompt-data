Given the initial state, the code snippet modifies the value of `n` by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]` to it.

Initial State:
- `removals` is at least 5
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer
- `elements` is a list of integers
- `pos` is a list containing three elements `s - 2 * n`, `s`, and `s - 2 * n`
- `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]` minus `elements[-5]`
- `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `2 * elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 * elements[-4]`; otherwise, `n` is 0
- `i` is 5

Code Snippet:
```
n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]
```

Impact:
- The value of `n` is updated by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + 5)]` and `elements[-5]` to it.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 5, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing three elements `s - 2 * n`, `s`, and `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]` minus `elements[-5]`, `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `2 * elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 * elements[-4]` plus `elements[-(negatives + 5)] - elements[-5]`; otherwise, `n` is `elements[-(negatives + 5)] - elements[-5]`, `i` is 5.**

In simpler terms:
- `n` is updated by adding the difference between the element at index `-(negatives + 5)` and the element at index `-5` in the `elements` list to its current value.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
