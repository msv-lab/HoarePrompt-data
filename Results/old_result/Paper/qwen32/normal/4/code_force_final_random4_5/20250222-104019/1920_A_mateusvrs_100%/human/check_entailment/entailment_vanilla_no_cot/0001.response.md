Let's break down the program and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the integers that `k` must not be equal to.
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`) and `bx` to a very small number (`-1`). `ax` will store the maximum value `k` can be (from constraints of type 2), and `bx` will store the minimum value `k` can be (from constraints of type 1).

3. **Reading Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the integer `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x` (ensuring `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x` (ensuring `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After reading all constraints, it checks if `bx` (minimum possible `k`) is greater than `ax` (maximum possible `k`). If this is the case, there are no possible values for `k`, so it appends `0` to the results list `r`.
   - If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by:
     - Initializing `tmp` to `0`.
     - Iterating through each `i` in `cx` and checking if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`. If so, it increments `tmp` by `1` (counting the number of values that `k` cannot be).
     - Finally, it appends the result `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the results list `r`. This represents the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` minus the integers that `k` cannot be.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results stored in `r`, each on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes each test case, calculates the feasible range for `k`, and subtracts the values that `k` cannot be from this range. It handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
