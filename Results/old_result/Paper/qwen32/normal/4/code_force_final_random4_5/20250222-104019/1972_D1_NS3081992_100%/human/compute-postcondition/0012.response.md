To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how the variables `i` and `ans` evolve with each iteration.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop continues as long as the following conditions are met:
1. `i <= m`
2. `i * i <= n + i`

During each iteration:
- `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`
- `i` is incremented by 1

### Observations:
- The loop starts with `i = 1` and `ans = 0`.
- After the first iteration (`i = 1`), `ans` becomes `n + 1`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 2`), `ans` becomes `n + 1 + (n + 3) // 9`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 3`), `ans` becomes `n + 1 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16`.

### General Pattern:
Each iteration adds a term to `ans` based on the current value of `i`. The loop continues until either `i` exceeds `m` or `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.

### Final Output State:
The final state of `i` will be the smallest integer greater than `m` or the smallest integer `i` such that `i * i > n + i`.

Let's denote the final value of `i` as `i_final`. The final value of `ans` will be the sum of all terms `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` from 1 to `i_final - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will terminate when `i` is such that `i > m` or `i * i > n + i`. The final state of `ans` will be the sum of all the terms calculated during the iterations.

### Output State:
Given the loop's behavior and the provided initial and intermediate states, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`i` is the smallest integer greater than `m` or such that `i * i > n + i`, and `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to `i_final - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will keep running, updating `ans` and incrementing `i`, until `i` exceeds `m` or `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. The final `ans` will be the accumulated sum of the terms calculated during these iterations.
