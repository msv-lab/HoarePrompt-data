Postcondition: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence. `i` is `t + 1`.**
