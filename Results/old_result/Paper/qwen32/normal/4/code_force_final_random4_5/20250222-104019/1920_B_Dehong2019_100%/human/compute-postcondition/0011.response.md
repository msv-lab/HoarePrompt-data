The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `a[i]` from `ans1`. Given that `ans1` was previously defined as the sum of the list `a` minus four times the value of `a[i]`, and `i` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `ans1` is recalculated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from the input where `x` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus four times the value of `a[i-1]` minus two times the value of `a[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

This means that `ans1` has been updated to reflect the subtraction of two times the current `a[i]` from its previous value, and `i` has been incremented by 1.
