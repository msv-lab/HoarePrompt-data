In the given `while` loop, the condition for the loop to execute is `r - l > 1`. This means that for the loop to proceed, the difference between `r` and `l` must be greater than 1.

Let's analyze the provided state:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation.
- `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be at least 2.
- `mid` is `n // 2`. 
- If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to `n // 2`. Otherwise, `r` is updated to `n // 2`.

However, the provided state does not specify the current values of `l` and `r`, which are the only variables in the loop head. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `r - l > 1`.

Given that we don't know the exact values of `l` and `r` from the provided state, we can only ensure that the condition `r - l > 1` is met by setting `l` and `r` accordingly. A simple way to ensure this is to set `l` to 0 (a common starting point) and `r` to `n` (the length of the array). This guarantees that `r - l` is at least `n`, which is greater than 1 for `n` at least 2.

Therefore, the state we need to adjust to is:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be at least 2; `l` is 0; `r` is `n`**

This ensures that `r - l > 1` and the loop can execute one more time.
