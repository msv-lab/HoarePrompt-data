Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`**
