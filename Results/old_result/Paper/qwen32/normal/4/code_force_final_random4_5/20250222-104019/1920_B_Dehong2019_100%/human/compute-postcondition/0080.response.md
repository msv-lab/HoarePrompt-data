The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`), and `k` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `k` should remain the same.

State: **`k` is greater than 0; `i` is `i_end + 1`; `ans1` is incremented by `a[i]`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is further decremented by `a[i + x] * 2`. `a` and `i` remain unchanged; `ans2` is the maximum value between the previous `ans1` and `ans2`.**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the final adjusted state is:

State: **`k` is greater than 0; `i` is `i_end + 1`**
