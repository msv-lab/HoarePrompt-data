You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a

    #State: The program does not return 'Yes' and the loop has finished all iterations.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` positive integers where `n` is between 2 and 50, inclusive. It checks if any contiguous subsequence of `a` concatenated with itself contains a sorted version of `a`. The function returns 'Yes' if such a subsequence is found, otherwise it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n positive integers where 2 <= n <= 50, and each element a_i in a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

    #State: `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `1 + t * (1 + n_last)`, where `n_last` is the length of the last list `a` processed; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result` for each iteration; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]` for the last iteration; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)` for the last iteration.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: result_1\nresult_2\n...\nresult_k (where result_i is the value returned by func_1(a) for the i-th iteration)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of positive integers. For each test case, it computes a result using the `func_1` function and prints the results, one per line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The `func_1` function checks whether the given array `a` can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by concatenating the array with itself and checking if any subarray of length `n` (the length of `a`) matches the sorted version of `a`. The `func_2` function reads input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.

Let's break down the logic:
1. **Sorting and Concatenation**: The function `func_1` first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`. Then, it creates a new array `concatenated_a` by concatenating `a` with itself. This step allows us to check if the sorted array can be obtained by any rotation of `a`.
2. **Checking Subarrays**: The function then iterates through possible starting points of subarrays within `concatenated_a` that have the same length as `a`. If any of these subarrays match `sorted_a`, it returns 'Yes'.
3. **Returning Result**: If no such subarray is found, the function returns 'No'.

The logic of checking subarrays within the concatenated array is correct because it covers all possible rotations of the original array `a`. If any rotation of `a` can be sorted, it will appear as a subarray in `concatenated_a`.

The `func_2` function handles multiple test cases correctly by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and then printing the results.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases, and there are no known edge cases that it fails to handle. Therefore, the correctness is True.
