Postcondition: **`t` is 19, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `s` is the string from the input, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`. If the current character `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
