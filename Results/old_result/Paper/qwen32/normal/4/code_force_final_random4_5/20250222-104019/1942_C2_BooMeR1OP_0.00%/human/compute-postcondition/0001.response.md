The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and assigns this list to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `x`, and `y` are already assigned integer values. The value of `x` indicates the number of integers that will be read from the second line of input, and these integers represent the vertices Bessie has chosen.

After executing the code, the variable `a` will hold a list of `x` distinct integers. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and `a` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to n.**
