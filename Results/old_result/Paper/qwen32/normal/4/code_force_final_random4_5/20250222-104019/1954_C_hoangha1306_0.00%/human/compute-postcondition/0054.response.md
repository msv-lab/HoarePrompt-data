The code snippet provided concatenates the string representation of `y` to the variable `kq1`. Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except for `kq1`. The new value of `kq1` is its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, `kq1` is its previous value concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**
