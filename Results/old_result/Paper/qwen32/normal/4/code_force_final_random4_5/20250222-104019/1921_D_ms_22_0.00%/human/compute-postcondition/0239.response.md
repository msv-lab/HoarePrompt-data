The code snippet `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]` (which is `diff`), `tp1` is incremented by 1.**
