The provided code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The code does not affect the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`), as they are not mentioned in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.**
