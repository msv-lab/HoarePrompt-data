The given code snippet `prev = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `prev`. The initial state does not specify a value for `i`, so we will represent the new state of `prev` as `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is `i`, `kp` is unchanged, `r` is the user's input, and `r` is `'>'`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `prev` is now set to the value of `i`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
