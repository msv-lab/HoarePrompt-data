Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s` and is greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. If `ans` is 1, it indicates that `n - 2` is odd or the loop did not break early. If `ans` is 0, it indicates that `n - 2` is even and the loop broke early.**
