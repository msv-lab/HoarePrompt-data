### Reasoning:
The original assessment claims that the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the program step-by-step based on the annotated code and the problem description to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine whether an array `a` can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where the array is split into two parts and the parts are swapped. The key insight is that this operation is equivalent to rotating the array. Therefore, the array can be sorted by checking if any rotation of the array is sorted.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Sorting and Concatenation**:
   - `sorted_a = sorted(a)`: This creates a sorted version of the input array `a`.
   - `concatenated_a = a + a`: This concatenates the array with itself. This step is crucial because any rotation of `a` will appear as a contiguous subarray in `concatenated_a`.

2. **Checking Subarrays**:
   - The program then iterates through possible starting points of subarrays within `concatenated_a` that have the same length as `a`. Specifically, it checks if any of these subarrays match `sorted_a`.
   - `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a`: This condition checks if the subarray starting at index `i` in `concatenated_a` matches the sorted version of `a`.

3. **Returning Result**:
   - If any such subarray is found, the function returns 'Yes'.
   - If no such subarray is found after checking all possible starting points, the function returns 'No'.

#### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, confirming that the logic is as intended.
- The function `func_1` correctly checks all possible rotations of `a` by examining subarrays of length `n` in `concatenated_a`.
- The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and handles input/output as specified.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Already Sorted Array**: If `a` is already sorted, the function will return 'Yes' because the sorted version of `a` will match the subarray starting at index 0 in `concatenated_a`.
- **Array with One Rotation**: If `a` can be sorted by a single rotation, the function will return 'Yes' because the rotated version will appear as a subarray in `concatenated_a`.
- **Array with Multiple Rotations**: The function will correctly identify if any rotation results in a sorted array by checking all possible subarrays.
- **Unsortable Array**: If no rotation can sort the array, the function will return 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks all possible rotations of the array by examining subarrays in the concatenated version of the array. The program handles multiple test cases and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
