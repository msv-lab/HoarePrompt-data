To determine what will be printed, let's break down the `print` statement step by step using the provided initial state:

1. **Identify the variables and their values:**
   - `sum` is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6}\), but it is not directly used in the print statement.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can't determine its numerical value, but we know it is an integer.
   - `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `t` is explicitly given as 2, but it is not used in the print statement.

2. **Analyze the print statement:**
   - `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`
   - The first argument is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is the expression `n - j + 1`. Given `j` is 3, this becomes `n - 3 + 1` or `n - 2`.
   - The third argument uses the unpacking operator `*` to print all elements of the range `range(1, n + 1)`. This range will produce a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Determine the output:**
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `n - 2`, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - The subsequent values printed are the integers from 1 to `n`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we describe the output in terms of `n`:

Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, ..., n (where n is an integer greater than or equal to 1)**
