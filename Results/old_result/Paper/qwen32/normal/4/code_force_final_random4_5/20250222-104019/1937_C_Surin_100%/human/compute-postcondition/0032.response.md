The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This command flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console immediately. However, this command does not affect the values of any variables in the program.

Therefore, none of the variables `n`, `g`, `v1`, or `prev` are changed by this code snippet. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is 0**.
