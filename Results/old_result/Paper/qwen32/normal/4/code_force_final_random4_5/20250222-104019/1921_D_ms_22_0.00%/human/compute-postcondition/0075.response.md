Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining. The variable `item` is assigned the value of the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated by `diff2`. `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])` and `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`.**
