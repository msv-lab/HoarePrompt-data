Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, and `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining, except one tuple has been removed. The variable `ans` has been increased by the value of `-item[0]`. The variable `item` is assigned the value of the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
