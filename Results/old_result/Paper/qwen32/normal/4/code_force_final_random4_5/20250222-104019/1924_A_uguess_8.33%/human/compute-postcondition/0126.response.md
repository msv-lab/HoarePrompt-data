Output State: **`cnt` is 1 or 2, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input, `ss` is `s[2]`, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[2]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The only variable that changes is `cnt`, which is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, and `cur_ss` remain the same, and the condition for updating `cur` remains unchanged.
