The given code snippet adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Let's determine how this affects the initial state:

- `extra` is initially the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `done` or `extra` if `old` was in `extra`.
- After executing `extra.add(a[r])`, the set `extra` will now include the element `a[r]` if it was not already present.

Since `a[r]` is not in `todo` (as per the initial state), adding `a[r]` to `extra` does not conflict with the definition of `todo`. Also, the addition of `a[r]` to `extra` does not affect the sets `done` or `todo` directly, nor does it change the values of `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `old`.

Therefore, the only change is that `extra` now includes `a[r]`.

Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`. `todo` is either an empty set or contains the element `old` if `old` was in `done`. `extra` is the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`, excluding `old` if `old` was in `done` or `extra` if `old` was in `extra`, and now includes `a[r]`. `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. `n` remains unchanged. `m` is less than `n`. `k` remains unchanged. `a` remains unchanged. `old` is `a[r - m]`. `a[r]` is not in `todo`.**
