The code snippet creates a new matrix `mat` with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`. This redefines the matrix `mat` and does not affect the other variables `t`, `n`, `res`, or `i`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is the input integer, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is 1.**
