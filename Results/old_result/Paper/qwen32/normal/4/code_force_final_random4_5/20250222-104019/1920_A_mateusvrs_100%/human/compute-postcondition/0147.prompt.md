Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each of the t test cases starts with an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Following n lines describe the constraints for each test case, where each line contains two integers a and x, where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. a=1 means k must be greater than or equal to x, a=2 means k must be less than or equal to x, and a=3 means k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same. `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx > ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bx` and `ax` are integers. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `r` has a new element appended, which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set of all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `t` is at least 1, and `n` is the number of iterations. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` now contains an additional element `0`. Otherwise, `r` includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, and `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3`. `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, and `r` remains unchanged except that if `bx > ax`, `0` is appended to `r`; otherwise, a new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is appended to `r`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
