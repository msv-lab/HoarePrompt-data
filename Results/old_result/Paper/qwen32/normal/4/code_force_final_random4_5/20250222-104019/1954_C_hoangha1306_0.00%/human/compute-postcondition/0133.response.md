The code snippet assigns the minimum and maximum of the integer values of characters at index `i` in strings `a` and `b` to variables `x` and `y`, respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `vt`, and `q` are not affected by this code snippet.

Given that the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` will be the smaller of the two integer values, and `y` will be the larger of the two integer values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a new string provided by the user input with length at least 1; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `kq1` is an empty string; `kq2` is an empty string; `vt` is 0; `q` is `q + 1`; the characters at index `i` in `a` and `b` are not equal; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`.**
