t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and p is a permutation of the integers from 0 to n-1. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The function `ask(a, b, c, d)` is used to query the interactor with indices a, b, c, and d, and it returns a string "<", "=", or ">" based on the comparison of (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d).
