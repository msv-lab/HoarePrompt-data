The value of `k` is updated to be equal to the value of `j`. Since `j` is 0, `k` is also set to 0. The values of `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged. The condition `d[j] is not in e[k:]` is still valid because the values of `j` and `k` have not changed the indices being referenced.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `k` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`**.
