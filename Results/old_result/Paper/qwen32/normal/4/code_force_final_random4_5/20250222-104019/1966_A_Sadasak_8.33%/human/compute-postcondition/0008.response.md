The code snippet sets the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. This means that regardless of the previous value of `frequency_table[num]`, it will now be exactly `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 2 elements; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key, and `frequency_table[num]` is `k`; `num` is the next element in the list `arr`.**
