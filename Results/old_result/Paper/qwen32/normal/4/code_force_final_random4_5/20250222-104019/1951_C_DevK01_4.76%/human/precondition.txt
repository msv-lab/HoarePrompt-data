Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9) representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought. Additionally, the test case contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
