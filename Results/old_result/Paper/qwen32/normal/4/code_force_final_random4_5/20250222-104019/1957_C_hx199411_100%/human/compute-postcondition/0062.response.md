The given code snippet increments the variable `num` by 2. Initially, `num` can be either 2, 3, or 4. After the operation `num += 2`, the possible values for `num` become 4, 5, or 6.

The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specified that `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input, and the condition `If c equals r, then num is 2 or 3. Otherwise, num is 3 or 4` is also preserved.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is either 4, 5, or 6, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` was initially 2 or 3 (now 4 or 5). Otherwise, `num` was initially 3 or 4 (now 5 or 6).**
