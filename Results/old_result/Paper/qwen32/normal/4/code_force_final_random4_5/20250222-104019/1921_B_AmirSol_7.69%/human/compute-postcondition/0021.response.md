The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` was initially `n - 2`, after the increment, `i` becomes `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is `n - 1`**.
