### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem described, where a permutation of size `n` and a number `x` are given. The goal is to perform at most 2 swaps on the permutation and then use a binary search algorithm to find `x` such that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of space-separated integers and returns a map object.
   - `func_2()` converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list.
   - `func_3()` reads the integer `n` (length of the permutation) and `k` (the number to find) using `func_1()`, and then reads the permutation itself using `func_2()`.

2. **Finding the Position of `k`:**
   - The code iterates through the permutation to find the index `pos` of `k`.

3. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The code performs a binary search on the permutation.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n-1`.
   - The binary search loop continues until `low + 1 < high`.
   - During each iteration, the middle index `mid` is calculated and added to a set `st`.
   - Depending on the value at `mid`, either `low` or `high` is updated.

4. **Output:**
   - If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it prints `1` and the 1-based indices of `low` and `pos` (the indices of the lower bound of the binary search and the first occurrence of `k`).

#### Issues in the Code:
- The code only handles the case where `arr[low]` is equal to `k` or not, but it does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search if `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
- The code does not perform any swaps if `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, which is required to make `p_l` equal to `x` after the binary search.
- The problem requires performing at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search, but the provided code does not implement this logic.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the logic required to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. Therefore, the provided code does not meet the problem description.
