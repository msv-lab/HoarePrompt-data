The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `i` is described as `i + 1`, which indicates that `i` has already been incremented by 1 at some point before the given code snippet. The state of `i` remains unchanged by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, and `count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `count` is incremented by 1**.
