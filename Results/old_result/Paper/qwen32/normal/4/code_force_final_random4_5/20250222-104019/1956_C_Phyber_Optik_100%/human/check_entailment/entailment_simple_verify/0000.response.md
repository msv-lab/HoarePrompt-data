Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using the given operations. The operations allow us to set the values of rows and columns using permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The maximum sum can be achieved by strategically setting the rows and columns to maximize the sum of all elements.

### Program Analysis
The provided program calculates the maximum sum as follows:
```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```
This formula calculates the sum of the first \( n \) squares multiplied by their respective indices. Specifically, it computes the sum:
\[ \text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 \]

This formula is correct for the maximum sum achievable when filling the matrix optimally. The sum of the first \( n \) squares is:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6} \]

However, the program does not actually perform the operations to fill the matrix. Instead, it prints the calculated sum and a sequence of operations that do not necessarily achieve this maximum sum.

### Operations Analysis
The operations printed by the program are:
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```
These operations do not guarantee that the matrix will be filled in a way that maximizes the sum. The operations printed are:
- Set the \( (n-j+1) \)-th row to the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].
- Set the \( (n-j+1) \)-th column to the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

This sequence of operations does not necessarily lead to the maximum sum. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the operations printed are:
```
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 2
1 1 1 2
2 1 1 2
```
This does not achieve the maximum sum of 8, as the matrix would be filled as:
\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix} \]
which sums to 6.

### Correct Operations
To achieve the maximum sum, we need to fill the matrix such that each row and column contains the numbers from 1 to \( n \) in a way that maximizes the sum. One possible way to do this is:
- Set the first row to [1, 2, ..., n].
- Set the second row to [2, 3, ..., n, 1].
- Set the third row to [3, 4, ..., n, 1, 2].
- And so on.

This ensures that each row and column contains the numbers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once, achieving the maximum sum.

### Conclusion
The program calculates the correct maximum sum but does not perform the operations correctly to achieve this sum. Therefore, the original assessment is correct: the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
