The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, so after executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the newly read values. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the maximum value in `p` is indeed greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.**
