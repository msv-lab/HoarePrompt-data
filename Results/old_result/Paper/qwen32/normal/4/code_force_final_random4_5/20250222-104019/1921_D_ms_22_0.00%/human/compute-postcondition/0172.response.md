The value of `tp2` is updated to `m - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` contains the sum of the differences, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
