The code snippet `ind.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ind`. Therefore, the list `ind` will now contain the value `i` as its last element. The values of `a`, `x`, `c`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `x` is the value of `a[k]` for the current test case. `ind` is a list containing the value `i`. `c` is 0. `n` is a valid integer from one of the test cases in `a`. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`.**
