Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a new list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`, where each element in `p` is the count of a unique element in `l`. The program does not modify any of these variables based on the if-else condition.**
