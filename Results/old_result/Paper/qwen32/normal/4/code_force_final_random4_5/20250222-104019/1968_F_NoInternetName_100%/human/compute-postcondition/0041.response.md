Let's break down the provided initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`a`**: This is a list returned by `func_1(int)`. The exact contents of this list are not specified, but it is a list of integers.
2. **`n` and `q`**: These are values returned by `func_1(int)`, with the additional condition that `q` must be greater than 0.
3. **`l` and `r`**: These are new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`. These are indices within the list `a`.
4. **`x`**: This is a list defined as `[0] + [cumulative XOR results]`. Each element in `x` (after the first element) is the XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`. Essentially, `x` is a cumulative XOR list starting from 0.
5. **`inds`**: This is a `defaultdict` of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs.
6. **`lower` and `upper`**: These are recalculated based on the new `l` and `r`, but their exact values are not provided.
7. **`i`**: This variable is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not provided.

### Print Statement

The print statement is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis

The print statement simply prints the string `'Yes'`. There are no variables or conditions in the print statement that depend on the values of `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `inds`, `lower`, `upper`, or `i`. The string `'Yes'` is a constant and does not change based on the state of the program.

### Output

Output: **Yes**
