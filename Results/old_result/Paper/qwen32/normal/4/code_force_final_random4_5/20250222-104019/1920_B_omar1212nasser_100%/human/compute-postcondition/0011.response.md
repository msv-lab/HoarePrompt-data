To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `removals`.

Given:
- `removals` is at least 1.
- `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`).
- `elements` is a list of integers.
- `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`.
- If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s` is the sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]` and `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(negatives + i)]`. Otherwise, `s` and `s2` remain unchanged.

The loop is:
```python
for i in range(1, removals + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` such that `1 <= k <= removals`. For the next iteration to occur, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `removals`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `removals` remains unchanged.

The other variables (`negatives`, `elements`, `pos`, `s`, `s2`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we do not know the exact value of `k`, we can represent the state as:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to be precise:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

Given that `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the start of the next iteration will have `i = k + 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To make it clear:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

Since we are not given the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent it as:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Simplifying, we get:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

In a more precise form:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1**.

So, the final state is:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Simplifying:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` and the newly appended value `s - 2 * s2`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Thus, the final state is:
