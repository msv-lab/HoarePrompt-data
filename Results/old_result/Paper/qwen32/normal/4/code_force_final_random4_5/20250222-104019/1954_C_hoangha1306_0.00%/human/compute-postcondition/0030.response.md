The code snippet `kq2 = kq2 + a[i]` updates the value of `kq2` by appending the character at index `i` of string `a` to `kq2`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The value of `kq1` is also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + a[i]`, `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + a[i]`.**
