To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input

Since `t` is `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 before the decrement. Therefore, `t` must have been at least 1 at the start of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `A` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input**
