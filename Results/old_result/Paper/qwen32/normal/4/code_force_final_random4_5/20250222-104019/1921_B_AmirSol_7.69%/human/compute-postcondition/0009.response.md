The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 1, `i` is 1, and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`. Additionally, either `i` is equal to `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`.**
