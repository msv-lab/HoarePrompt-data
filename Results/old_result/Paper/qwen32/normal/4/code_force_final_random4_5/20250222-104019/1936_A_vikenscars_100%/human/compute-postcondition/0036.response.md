The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. The other variables (`max_item_idx`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `pair_idx`, and `n`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` in the range 1 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', or 0 if `func_1` never returns '<', `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `ans2` is either '>', or the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` if `ans2` is not '>', `pair_idx` is 1 if `ans1` is '<', or 1 if `ans1` is '=' and `ans2` is '>', otherwise `pair_idx` remains 0, and `i` is 2**
