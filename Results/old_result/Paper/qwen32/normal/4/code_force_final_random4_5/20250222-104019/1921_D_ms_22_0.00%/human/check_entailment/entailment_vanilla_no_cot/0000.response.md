Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always produce the maximum possible total difference \( D \) as it attempts to use a heap to manage the differences, but it does not correctly handle the assignment of the largest possible differences for each element in \( a \). The strategy of using the smallest and largest elements from \( b \) for each element in \( a \) is correct in principle, but the implementation in the code does not guarantee the optimal solution in all cases.

The correct approach would involve sorting both arrays \( a \) and \( b \) and then greedily assigning the smallest and largest elements from \( b \) to maximize the difference for each element in \( a \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        b.sort()
        
        ans = 0
        bp1 = 0  # Pointer for the smallest elements in b
        bp2 = m - 1  # Pointer for the largest elements in b
        
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[bp1]) > abs(a[i] - b[bp2]):
                ans += abs(a[i] - b[bp1])
                bp1 += 1
            else:
                ans += abs(a[i] - b[bp2])
                bp2 -= 1
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that for each element in \( a \), the element in \( b \) that maximizes the difference is chosen, either from the smallest or largest available elements in \( b \).
