The code snippet `a = input()` reads a new string from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means the previous value of `a` (which was a binary string of length `n`) is replaced by the new input string. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from input such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a new binary string of length `n` read from input; `b` is a binary string of length `m`.**
