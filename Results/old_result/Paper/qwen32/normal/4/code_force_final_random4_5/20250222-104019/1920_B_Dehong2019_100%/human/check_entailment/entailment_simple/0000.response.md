### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by simulating the optimal moves of both Alice and Bob. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This allows us to easily access the largest and smallest elements.

3. **Initial Calculation**:
   - `ans1` is initialized to the sum of all elements in the array.
   - This represents the scenario where Bob inverts the `x` largest elements (since they are sorted in descending order, these are the first `x` elements).

4. **Simulating Alice's Move**:
   - The program iterates up to `k` times, simulating Alice removing the `i`-th largest element.
   - Each time Alice removes an element, it is added back to the sum (since it was initially subtracted twice when calculating `ans1`).
   - If `i + x < n`, the program then simulates Bob inverting the next largest element (which is now the `(i + x)`-th element in the sorted array).
   - The best possible sum (`ans2`) is updated accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum (`ans2`) after considering all possible optimal moves by both players.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic correctly simulates the optimal moves of both players.
  - By sorting the array in descending order, the program efficiently identifies which elements should be removed by Alice and which should be inverted by Bob.
  - The use of `ans1` and `ans2` ensures that the program keeps track of the best possible sum after each move.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles cases where `k` or `x` is equal to `n` (i.e., Alice can remove all elements or Bob can invert all elements).
  - It also handles cases where `k` or `x` is 1, meaning only one element can be removed or inverted.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
