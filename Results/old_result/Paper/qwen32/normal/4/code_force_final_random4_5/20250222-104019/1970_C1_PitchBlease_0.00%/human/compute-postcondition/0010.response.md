The code appends a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that `queue` now contains the previous elements (if any) along with the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. The `neighbor` is a node that is adjacent to `current` and has not been visited yet, and `dist + 1` represents the distance from the `start` node to this `neighbor` node.

The other variables (`start`, `target`, `tree`, `visited`, `current`, `dist`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i, and `tree[start]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that now contains the previous elements plus the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node, `current` node, and possibly other nodes; `current` is equal to `start` or another node in the tree; `dist` is a non-negative integer representing the distance from `start` to `current`; `neighbor` is a neighbor of `current` that is not in the `visited` set before this operation; `current` is not equal to `target`.**
