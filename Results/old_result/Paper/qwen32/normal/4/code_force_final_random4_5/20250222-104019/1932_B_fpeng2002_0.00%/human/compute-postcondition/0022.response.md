Output State: **`start_year` is `((nums[x] + 1) // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1]`, `num_tests` is a positive integer less than its previous value, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is `x + 1`**

In natural language: The value of `start_year` is recalculated to be `((nums[x] + 1) // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1]`. The value of `num_tests` is still a positive integer but has decreased from its previous value. The value of `n` remains an input integer, `nums` remains a list of integers with at least one element, and `x` has been incremented by 1.
