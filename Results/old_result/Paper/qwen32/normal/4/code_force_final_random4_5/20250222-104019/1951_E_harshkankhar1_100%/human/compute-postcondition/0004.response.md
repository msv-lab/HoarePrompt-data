The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`s`, `n`, `x`, and the result of `func_1(s[0:])`), but these variables and their values do not directly influence what is printed by the `print(1)` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
   - `x` is set to -1.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` returns `False`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(1)` statement is executed.
   - This statement is independent of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, and the result of `func_1(s[0:])`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1`.

Since the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the provided variables or their values, we can confidently state the output.

Output: **1**
