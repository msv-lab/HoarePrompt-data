Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `ii` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `r` is the last element of the list `a`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- `k` is 0 (Note: `k` is redefined here, but its initial value is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`r`**: The last element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted, `r` is the largest integer in the list.
2. **`n`**: An integer obtained from the input. It is not further specified what the value of `n` is, but it is used in the calculation.
3. **`rem`**: Explicitly set to 0.
4. **`y`**: Explicitly set to 0.

The print statement calculates:
\[ (r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y \]

Given `rem` and `y` are both 0, the expression simplifies to:
\[ (r - 1) * n + 1 \]

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression \((r - 1) * n + 1\), where `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a` and `n` is an integer obtained from the input.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the sorted list `a` and n is an integer obtained from the input)**
