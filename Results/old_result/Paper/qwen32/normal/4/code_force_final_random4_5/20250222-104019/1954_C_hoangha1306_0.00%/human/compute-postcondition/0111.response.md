The code snippet provided appends the string representation of `y` to the existing value of `kq1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `vt` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Given that `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`, the new value of `kq1` will be its previous value concatenated with the string version of `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are non-empty strings provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 2; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[2])` and `int(b[2])`; `vt` is 1; `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**
