Let's break down the provided code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

Initial State:
- `res` is 110 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n` (though this matrix is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `n-2`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's analyze this step-by-step:
1. `'1 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement formats the string '1 %d' by replacing `%d` with the value of `i`. Since `i` is `n-2`, the string will be `'1 %d' % (n-2)`.
2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This part of the print statement unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and prints each element separated by a space.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i` or the exact range. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

- `i` is `n-2`.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` will produce numbers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:
- `'1 %d' % (n-2)` will be `'1 ' + str(n-2)`.
- Followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and n is the number of rows/columns in the matrix)**

For example, if `n` were 5, then `i` would be `5-2=3`, and the output would be `1 3 1 2 3 4 5`.

Thus, the final output in the required format is:
Output: **1 [n-2] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of n-2 and n is the number of rows/columns in the matrix)**
