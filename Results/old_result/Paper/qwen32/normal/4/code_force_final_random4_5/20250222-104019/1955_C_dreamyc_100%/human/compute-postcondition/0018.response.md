The given code snippet modifies the variable `s_b` by adding `nums[n - i - 1]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless `s_b` affects `ans` in subsequent code, which is not shown here.

Given the initial state and the code, the value of `s_b` is updated to `s_b + nums[n - i - 1]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `s_a`, `i`, and `ans`) retain their initial values unless affected by the subsequent code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `s_a` is `nums[i] + nums[i]`; `s_b` is `s_b + nums[n - i - 1]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `s_b` is less than or equal to `b` in subsequent checks.**
