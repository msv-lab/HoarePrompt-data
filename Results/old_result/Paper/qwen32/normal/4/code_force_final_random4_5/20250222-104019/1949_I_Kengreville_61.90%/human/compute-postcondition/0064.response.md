The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. The variable `c0` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is that `c0` remains increased by the value of `coef0[j]`, and `c1` is increased by the value of `coef1[j]`.

Output State: **`c0` is increased by the value of `coef0[j]`; `c1` is increased by the value of `coef1[j]`.**
