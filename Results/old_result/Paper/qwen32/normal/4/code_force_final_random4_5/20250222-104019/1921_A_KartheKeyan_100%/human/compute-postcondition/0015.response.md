The code sorts the list `coord` which contains four tuples. The sorting is based on the default sorting behavior of tuples in Python, which sorts primarily by the first element and secondarily by the second element if the first elements are equal.

Given that `coord` initially contains `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, after sorting, `coord` will be a new list where the tuples are ordered by their first elements, and if two tuples have the same first element, they are ordered by their second elements.

The variables `x` and `y` are both the fourth integer from the input, `n` is a non-zero integer, `res` is 0, and `i` is 3. These variables are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`x` is the fourth integer from the input, `y` is the fourth integer from the input, `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is a sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` based on the default tuple sorting, `res` is 0, `i` is 3.**
