The code snippet provided updates the value of `ans2` to be the maximum value between the current `ans1` and the current `ans2`. The values of `k`, `i`, and `ans1` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `ans1` is the previous `ans1` plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` is the previous `ans1` plus `a[i]`; `ans2` is the maximum value between the previous `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.**
