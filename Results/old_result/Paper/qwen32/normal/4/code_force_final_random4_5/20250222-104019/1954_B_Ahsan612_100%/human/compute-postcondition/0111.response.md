Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements. If `ar[i] == num`, then `i` is `i + 1` and `same` is either 3, 4, or 2 depending on the values of `ar[i-1]` and `ar[i-2]`, with `minn` being either `inf` or 1 depending on the value of `same`. Otherwise, `i` is `i + 2`, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, `same` is set to 1, and `minn` is set to 1.**
