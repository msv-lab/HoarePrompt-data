The function accepts a positive integer `num` and a list or array `Prime_array` where `Prime_array[i]` contains the smallest prime factor of `i` for all `i` from 2 up to at least the value of `num`. It returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `num`, where the keys are the prime factors and the values are their respective counts.
