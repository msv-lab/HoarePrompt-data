Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains the same; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is `[0]` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `[0, n]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except at index `n-1` where it is calculated based on the condition `ol <= zr`. If `el` is '>' and `ol <= zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`. If `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `ans[n-1]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[n - 1]` is `2 * n - 2 * func_1(preOne, zr) + 1`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `ans[n - 1]` is `1 - 2 * totalOne`. `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]`. `ol` is `totalOne` plus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`. `zr` is `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `1`. If `el` is '>' and `ol <= zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `el` is '>' and `ol > zr`, `zeroInd` is `0` and `oneInd` is `preOne[1] - x`, and `fi` is `1`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `zeroInd` is `n` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `el` is not '>' and `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is `1` and `oneInd` is `2 * totalOne`.**
