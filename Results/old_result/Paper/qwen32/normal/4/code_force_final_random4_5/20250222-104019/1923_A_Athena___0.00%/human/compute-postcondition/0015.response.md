The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a` has a trailing 0, the last element removed will be 0. Therefore, the list `a` will no longer have this trailing 0. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `res` remains 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list of integers without the trailing 0, `res` is 0**.
