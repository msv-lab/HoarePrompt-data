Output State: **t is 0, all test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the minimum length of a sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the array `ar` is printed if it exists; otherwise, -1 is printed.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the loop calculates the minimum length of a sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the array `ar`. If such a sequence exists and its length is neither the entire length of the array nor infinity, that length is printed. If no such sequence exists (which would mean all elements are unique or the array is empty), -1 is printed instead. The state of other variables like `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` will reflect the final state of the last iteration of the loop, but they are not relevant to the final output state of the program.
