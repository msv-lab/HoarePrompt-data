Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. If `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is set to False. Otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[0]` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains the first character of `a`. If `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `i` is set to 0, otherwise `i` is set to 1, and `work` is True. If `work` is False, `ans` is the first character of `b`, `i` is 1, and `work` is False.**
