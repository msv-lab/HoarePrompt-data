The value of `i` is decremented by 1, while the values of `dp`, `j`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially non-zero, after decrementing, `i` is still non-zero unless it was 1, in which case it would become 0. However, the precondition specifies that `i` must be non-zero, so we assume `i` was greater than 1 and is now `i - 1`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` represents the length of the LCS of `a` and `b`. `i` is now `i - 1` and must be non-zero. `j` must be non-zero.**
