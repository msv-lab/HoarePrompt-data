Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is equal to `low`. The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged, and the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
