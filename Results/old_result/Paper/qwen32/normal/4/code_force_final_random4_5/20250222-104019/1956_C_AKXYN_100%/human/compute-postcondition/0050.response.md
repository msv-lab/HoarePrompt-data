The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`res` is 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1**
