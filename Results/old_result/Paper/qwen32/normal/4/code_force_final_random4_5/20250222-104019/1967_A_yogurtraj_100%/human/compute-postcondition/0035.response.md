Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 2. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then `y` is `n - 3`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, with `k` set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[3]`, `rem` is 0, and `k` is decreased by (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]).**
