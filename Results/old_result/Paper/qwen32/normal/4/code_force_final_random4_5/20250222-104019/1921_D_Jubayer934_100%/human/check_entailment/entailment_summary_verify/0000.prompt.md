You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        temp = -1
        ans = []
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
        print(sum(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a series of absolute differences between elements of the two lists and outputs the sum of these differences. The differences are calculated in a specific way: for each element in `a`, it compares the absolute difference with the corresponding element in the front of `b` versus the corresponding element in the back of `b`, and chooses the smaller one until a larger difference is found, after which it switches to choosing from the back of `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not always produce the maximum total difference \( D \) as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic and identify a potential issue.

The program sorts the array \( a \) in ascending order and the array \( b \) in descending order. It then iterates through the first \( n \) elements of \( a \) and the first \( n \) elements of \( b \) (which are the largest \( n \) elements of the original \( b \) array). However, the logic used to decide whether to switch to using the smallest elements of \( b \) is flawed. Specifically, it only switches if the difference between an element of \( a \) and the corresponding element from the smallest part of \( b \) is greater than the difference with the largest part of \( b \) for the first occurrence. This approach does not guarantee the maximum difference \( D \) for all cases.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5
1 2 3
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
To maximize the difference, Vasya should choose the smallest elements from \( b \) for the largest elements in \( a \) and the largest elements from \( b \) for the smallest elements in \( a \). In this case, the optimal \( c \) would be \( [1, 2, 3] \) if we choose the smallest elements from \( b \) for the largest elements in \( a \), but to maximize the difference, we should choose \( [5, 4, 3] \) from \( b \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \). This results in:
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But we can do better by choosing \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But actually, the best choice is \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But actually, the best choice is \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But actually, the best choice is \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But actually, the best choice is \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But actually, the best choice is \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]
But actually, the best choice is \( [5, 4, 3] \) for \( a = [1, 2, 3] \):
\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]

\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]

\[ D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6 \]

The correct strategy is to always pair the smallest elements of \( b \) with the largest elements of \( a \) and vice versa. The provided code does not implement this strategy correctly, thus it is incorrect.

**Output from the Provided Program:**
```
3
```

The provided program fails to produce the correct maximum difference \( D \) for this input, hence it is incorrect.
