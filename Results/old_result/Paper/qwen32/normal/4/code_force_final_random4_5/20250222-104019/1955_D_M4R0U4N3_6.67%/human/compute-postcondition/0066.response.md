The code snippet adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. This means that `extra` will now include `a[r]` as one of its elements. The values of `r`, `old`, `a[r - m]`, `done`, and `todo` remain unchanged unless `a[r]` was already in `extra`, in which case adding it again has no effect since sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, there is no change to `done` or `todo`. `extra` includes `a[r]`.**
