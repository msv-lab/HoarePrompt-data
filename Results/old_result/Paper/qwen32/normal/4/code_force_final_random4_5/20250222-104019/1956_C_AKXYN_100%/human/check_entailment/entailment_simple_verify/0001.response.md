Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to ensure the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve filling rows or columns with permutations of the numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: To maximize the sum, each number from 1 to \( n \) should appear as frequently as possible in the matrix while respecting the permutation constraint.
2. **Permutation Constraint**: Each row and each column must be a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
3. **Optimal Strategy**: A straightforward strategy is to fill the matrix with the identity permutation for rows and then adjust columns to maximize the sum. This can be achieved using \( n \) Type 1 operations (one for each row) and \( n \) Type 2 operations (one for each column).

### Program Analysis
The provided program initializes the matrix and calculates the sum using a specific formula, then outputs the operations.

### Detailed Reasoning:
1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   ```python
   mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
   ```
   This initializes the matrix with the identity permutation for each row.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   res = 0
   for i in range(n):
       res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   The sum is calculated using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1) \times (2i+1) \). This formula does not directly correspond to the sum of the matrix elements but rather seems to be a specific pattern derived from the problem constraints.

3. **Operations**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   The program performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, which is within the \( 2n \) limit.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1 (n=1)**:
  - Matrix: \([1]\)
  - Sum: \(1\)
  - Operations: One Type 1 operation.
  
- **Example 2 (n=2)**:
  - After Type 1 operations:
    \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    1 & 2
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  - After Type 2 operations:
    \[
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 2 \\
    2 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \]
  - Sum: \(1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7\)

### Correctness Check:
The program seems to follow a strategy that aligns with the problem constraints. However, let's verify the sum calculation formula:
- The formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1) \times (2i+1) \) is not immediately clear why it gives the maximum sum. Let's derive the expected maximum sum:
  - Each row and each column can be filled with the numbers 1 to \( n \) in a way that maximizes the sum. The maximum sum is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times, which is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

Given the problem constraints, the correct sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled optimally should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Let's check the formula:
- For \( n = 2 \):
  - Correct sum: \( 2 \times \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 6 \)
  - Program's sum: \( (1 \times 1) + (2 \times 3) = 1 + 6 = 7 \)

The program's sum calculation seems to be incorrect as it does not match the expected maximum sum for \( n = 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The program's sum calculation formula is incorrect, leading to an incorrect maximum sum for some test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
