The program could raise an exception at any point within the `try` block, specifically during the execution of `int(a[g]) - 1` or `int(a[d]) - 1`. This could happen if `a[g]` or `a[d]` are not convertible to an integer (e.g., if they are strings that do not represent a number, or if they are of a non-string, non-integer type).

If no exception occurs, the program will:
- Decrement the integer value of `a[g]` by 1.
- Decrement the integer value of `a[d]` by 1.
- If `a[g]` becomes 0, it increments `g` by 1.
- If `a[d]` becomes 0, it decrements `d` by 1.
- `i` remains `i + 1`.

If an exception occurs, the program will break out of the most internal loop or enclosing control structure (such as a `for` or `while` loop).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`. If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is `g + 1` and `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`. If `a[g]` was not 0, then `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`. If `a[d]` was originally 0, then `d` is `d - 1` and `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`. Otherwise, `a[d]` remains `int(a[d]) - 1`. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or enclosing control structure.**
