Let's analyze the program and verify its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

### Problem Analysis:
- Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Key observations:
  - If `n < m`, it's impossible because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
  - If `n >= m`, it's possible if `n - m` is even. This is because each move changes the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes, and we need the final number of cubes to match the initial parity after `n` moves.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the logic in the provided program:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` (number of moves) and `c` (desired number of cubes).
3. It checks the following conditions:
   - If `b == c`, it prints "YES".
   - If `b < c`, it prints "NO".
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Evaluation:
- **Case 1: `b == c`**
  - This is correct. If the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, it's trivially possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves by adding one cube per move.
  
- **Case 2: `b < c`**
  - This is correct. If the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it's impossible to have more cubes than moves.
  
- **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**
  - This is correct. If `n - m` is even, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves because the parity of the number of cubes will match after the required number of additions and subtractions.
  
- **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**
  - This is correct. If `n - m` is odd, it's impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes because the parity will not match.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves. The function summary and the original assessment both align with the problem requirements and the program's behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
