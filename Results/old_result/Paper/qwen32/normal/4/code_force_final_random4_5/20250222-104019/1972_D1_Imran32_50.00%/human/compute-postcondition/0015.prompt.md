You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^6. The first line of the input contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test cases exceeds 2 · 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
        
    #State: n remains the same, k remains the same, root remains int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, ans is n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i from 2 to root.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i from 2 to root, and root is int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two positive integers `n` and `m` within the range of 1 to 2,000,000. The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, ensuring that the total sum of all `n` values and the total sum of all `m` values do not exceed 2,000,000. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided integers `n` and `m`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
