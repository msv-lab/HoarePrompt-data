Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input, `k` is 0.**

In simple terms, the variable `k` has been initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
