Postcondition: **t is a string representing the input, n is greater than 0, s is the input string, s1 is the count of '1's in s, t1 is the count of '1's in t, and cnt is the total number of positions where s[i] is not equal to t[i]. If the count of '1's in s is equal to the count of '1's in t, then s1 is equal to t1. Otherwise, s1 is not equal to t1 and d is the absolute difference between s1 and t1.**
