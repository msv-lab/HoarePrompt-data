Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; If `s_a` (which is `nums[i]`) is less than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0; `s_a` is `nums[i]`; `s_b` is `nums[n - i - 1]`.**
