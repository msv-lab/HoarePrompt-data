The code snippet provided overwrites the existing `arr` with a new list of integers obtained from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `mpp`, `first`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the integer obtained from the new input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the original `arr`; `first` is True if an `i` with `mpp[i] == 1` is found before `i` is not a key in `mpp`; `i` is the value that causes the loop to break.**
