The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `end` is `1`
- `ans` is calculated based on the conditions given
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers such that `a[n] == a[n - 1]`
- `le` is the length of `a` and `le` must be at least `n + 1`
- `l` is `n - 1`
- `st` is `n`

After executing `end += 1`, the value of `end` becomes `2`.

Output State: **`r` is `n - 1`, `end` is `2`, `ans` is calculated based on the conditions given, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers such that `a[n] == a[n - 1]`, `le` is the length of `a` and `le` must be at least `n + 1`, `l` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n`**.
