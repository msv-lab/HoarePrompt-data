The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided, but the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. If `k` is 1, the current value of `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value. The current value of `k` satisfies either `k <= 2 * n` or `k > 2 * n`.**
