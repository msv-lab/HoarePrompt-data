Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the length of the list `s` and `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing `0` as its first element followed by all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th element. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less.**
