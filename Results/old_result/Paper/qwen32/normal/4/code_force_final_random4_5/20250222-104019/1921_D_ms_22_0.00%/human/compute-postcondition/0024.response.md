The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))` pushes a new tuple into the `max_heap`. The tuple contains the negative of `diff2`, the current value of `i`, and `m - 1`.

Since `max_heap` is a max heap (implemented using a min heap with negative values), the new tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` will be added to the heap. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `ans`, `diff1`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `max_heap` now includes the new tuple.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` along with any previous tuples. `i` is the next element in `a` after the current one.**
