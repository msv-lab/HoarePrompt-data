The code snippet `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order. The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `L` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of n integers where 1 â‰¤ a_i â‰¤ 10^9, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**
