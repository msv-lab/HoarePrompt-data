Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`; `b` is a list of 26 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: r is a string formed by concatenating elements from `a` based on the indices of elements in `s` within `b`, and `b` has incremented values at those indices.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is a string formed by concatenating `a[x]` for each `i` in `s`; `b` has incremented values at the indices corresponding to the elements in `s`; `t` is incremented by the length of `s`; `n` and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is a concatenation of `a[x]` for each `i` in `s`, `b` has incremented values at the indices corresponding to the elements in `s`, `t` is `X + len(s)`, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the input list of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
