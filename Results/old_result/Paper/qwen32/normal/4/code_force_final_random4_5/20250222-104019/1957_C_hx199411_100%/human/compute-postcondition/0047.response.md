The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `n`, `t`, `num`, `m`, and `dp` do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. The value of `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is 0, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 0**
