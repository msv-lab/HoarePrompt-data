### Reasoning:
The provided program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function, `func_1`, handles input parsing and orchestrates the processing of multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`. It then sorts the array and calls `func_2` to compute the optimal sum after Alice and Bob's moves.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input Handling**: It correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`.
- **Sorting**: It sorts the array `a` in ascending order, which is a crucial step for the subsequent logic in `func_2`.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Special Case Handling**: The function checks if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, and if so, it returns 0. This special case is not mentioned in the problem statement and does not align with the optimal strategy for the game.
- **Calculation Logic**: The function calculates possible sums of the array after Alice's and Bob's moves. It iteratively considers different numbers of elements removed by Alice and calculates the resulting sum after Bob's moves. It maintains a list `pos` of these sums and returns the maximum value.
- **IndexError Handling**: It handles `IndexError` by setting `n` to 0, which is a safeguard against accessing elements out of bounds.

### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect Special Case Handling**: The special case in `func_2` where it returns 0 when `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3 does not align with the problem description. This special case should not be hardcoded and should be removed.
- **Optimal Strategy**: The function logic seems to be attempting to find the optimal strategy but the hardcoded special case suggests it might not be fully correct.

### Conclusion:
Given the hardcoded special case and the fact that the problem description does not specify such a case, the program is not correct as it stands. The special case should be removed, and the function should rely solely on the logic for calculating the optimal sum.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
