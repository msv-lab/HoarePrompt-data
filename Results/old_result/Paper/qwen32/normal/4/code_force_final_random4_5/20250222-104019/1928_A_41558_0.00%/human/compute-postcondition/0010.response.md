Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, and at least one of `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`, then either `a` is twice `b` or `b` is twice `a`. Otherwise, neither `a` is half of `b` nor `b` is half of `a`.**
