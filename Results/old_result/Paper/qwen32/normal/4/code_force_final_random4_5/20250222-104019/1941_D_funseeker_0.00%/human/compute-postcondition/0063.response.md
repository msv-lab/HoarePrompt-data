Postcondition: **`n` and `m-2` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`. `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, plus the newly added elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` contains only the newly added element `(q + r) % n`. `ans` is a set containing at least one element, where each element is a value `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`, plus the newly added element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '0', `temp` remains an empty set and `ans` does not include the newly added element `(q + r) % n`. `q` is the next element in the iteration sequence of `ans`.**
