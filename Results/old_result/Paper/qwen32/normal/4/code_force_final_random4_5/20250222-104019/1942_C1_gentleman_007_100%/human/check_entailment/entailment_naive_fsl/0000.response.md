Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any logic to solve the problem described. The code consists of a series of utility functions (`func_1` through `func_25`) that perform various operations such as reading input, creating data structures, and performing computations. However, none of these functions are used to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with `n` sides, given `x` vertices chosen by Bessie and `y` vertices that can be chosen by the user (with `y` being 0 in this version).

The problem requires a specific algorithm to determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the given vertices without any intersecting diagonals. The provided code does not implement any such algorithm. Therefore, it is incorrect for the given problem description.
