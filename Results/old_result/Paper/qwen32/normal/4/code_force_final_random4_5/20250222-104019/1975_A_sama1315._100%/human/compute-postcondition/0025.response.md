The code snippet `result = func_1(a)` updates the value of the variable `result` to the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the argument `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `4 + 3*n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result` and the value of `result` again; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**.
