The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the state of other variables in the loop. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration to allow the loop to continue, provided `t` was greater than 0 in the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to have executed. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.**
