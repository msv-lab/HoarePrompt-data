The code snippet provided updates the value of the variable `nums_left` based on the initial state. Specifically, `nums_left` is set to `N - R[0] - 1`. Given the constraints and initial state, we can determine the new value of `nums_left`.

Since `R[0]` is `N`, the expression `N - R[0] - 1` simplifies to `N - N - 1`, which equals `-1`.

The other variables (`t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -1.**
