The provided code snippet `x = b.index(i)` attempts to find the index of the element `i` in the list `b`. However, there are some variables in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `s`, `r`) that are not mentioned in the code snippet, and the variables `b` and `i` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to accurately determine the output state. The code will raise a `NameError` because `b` and `i` are undefined.

Since we cannot execute the code with the given information, we will assume that `b` and `i` are part of the context not provided. If we were to assume `b` and `i` were defined elsewhere, the output state would involve `x` being assigned the index of `i` in `b`.

Given the incomplete information, the most accurate response we can provide based on the task requirements is that the code will result in an error due to undefined variables. However, if we hypothetically assume `b` and `i` are defined and `i` is in `b`, the output state would be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least 1 element; `r` is an empty string; `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.**

Since the task specifies to adhere strictly to the format and use the provided initial state, and given the undefined variables, the most accurate response we can provide is:

Output State: **The code will raise a NameError due to undefined variables `b` and `i`.**
