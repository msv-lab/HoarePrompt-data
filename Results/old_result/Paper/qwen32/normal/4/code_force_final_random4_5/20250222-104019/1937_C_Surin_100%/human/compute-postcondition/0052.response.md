The code snippet provided is `sys.stdout.flush()`. This function call flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all buffered output is written to the console. However, it does not modify any variables or change the state of the program in terms of variable values.

Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `g`, `v1`, `r`, `prev`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect this fact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `r` is the user's input, `prev` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is `v1 + 1`**.
