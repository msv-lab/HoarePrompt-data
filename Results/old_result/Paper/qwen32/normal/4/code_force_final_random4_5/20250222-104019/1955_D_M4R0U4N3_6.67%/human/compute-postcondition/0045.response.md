To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet in the context of the initial state:

Initial State: `r` is `r + 1`
Code:
```
old = a[r - m]
```

Here, `old` is being assigned the value of the element in the list `a` at the index `r - m`.

Since `r` is initially described as `r + 1`, we need to consider `r` as `r + 1` for the expression `r - m`. Therefore, the expression `r - m` becomes `(r + 1) - m`.

Thus, `old` will be assigned the value of `a[(r + 1) - m]`.

The other variables (`a`, `m`, `r`) are not modified by this code snippet, so their states remain the same.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[(r + 1) - m]`**
