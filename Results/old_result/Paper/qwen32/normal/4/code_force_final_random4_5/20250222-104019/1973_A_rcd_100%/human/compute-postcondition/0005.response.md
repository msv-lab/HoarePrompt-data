The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop structure provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and they hold the values read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
