The code snippet simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, `i` is 1**.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still greater than 0, `n` remains an input integer, `ar` remains a list of integers obtained from the input, `same` is still 1, `num` is still the first element of `ar`, `minn` is still infinity, and `i` is now 1.
