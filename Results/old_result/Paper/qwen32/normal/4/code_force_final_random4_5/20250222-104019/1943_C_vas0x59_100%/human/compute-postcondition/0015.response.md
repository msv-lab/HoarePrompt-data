Output State: **`u` is the input integer decremented by 1, `v` is the input integer decremented by 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `u` contains the values `[v, v]`, the list at index `v` contains the values `[v, v, u]`, and the list at index `w` (for all other `w` not equal to `u` or `v`) contains the values `[w, w]`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The input values for `u` and `v` are updated to be the input integers decremented by 1 and 2, respectively. The structure of `u2vs` remains unchanged as per the initial state description.
