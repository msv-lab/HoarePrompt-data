The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'STAIR'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`, `mn`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Let's break down the relevant information:
- The `print` statement is `print('STAIR')`.
- The string `'STAIR'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'STAIR'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **STAIR**
