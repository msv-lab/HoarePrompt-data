Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is the string input by the user, `count` is 0, `flag` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s) - 1):
    if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
        count += 1
    if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
        flag = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string input by the user and has a length of at least 2, `flag` is 1 if the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, otherwise `flag` remains 0, and `count` is 1 if `flag` is 1, otherwise `count` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string input by the user and has a length of at least 2, `i` is `i + 1`, `flag` is 1 if the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, otherwise `flag` remains 0, and `count` is incremented by 1 if the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `s` is a string input by the user and has a length of at least 2, `i` is `i + 2`. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, then `flag` is 1 if the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 2` in `s`, otherwise `flag` remains 0, and `count` is incremented by 2 if the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s` is not equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 2` in `s`, otherwise `count` is incremented by 1. If the integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, then `flag` and `count` remain unchanged. If `int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`, then `flag` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
