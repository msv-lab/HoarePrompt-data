Let's analyze the given Python program to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Key Points of the Problem
1. **Graph Construction**:
   - We have `n` vertices, numbered from 1 to `n`.
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to `n` to these vertices.
   - We add an edge between vertices `i` and `j` if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   
2. **Objective**:
   - Partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.
   - Output the assignment of integers, the number of cliques, and the partition.

### Analysis of the Provided Code

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`
- **Objective**: This function is supposed to compute the assignment of integers to vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition.
- **Implementation**:
  - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n / k`. This is a reasonable heuristic but not necessarily optimal.
  - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are supposed to store the assignment of integers and the clique assignments, respectively.
  - The loop `for i in range(cliques)` calls `make_array` to assign values to the vertices and assign them to a clique.
  - The function prints the arrays `arr`, `cliques`, and `cliquess`.

#### Function `make_array(left, right, clique)`
- **Objective**: This function assigns integer values to the vertices in the range `[left, right]` and assigns them to the `clique`.
- **Implementation**:
  - `small_element` and `big_element` are initialized to `left + 1` and `right + 1`, respectively.
  - The code calculates `mid` and `not_mid` to distribute values symmetrically.
  - The values are assigned to `arr` and the corresponding clique numbers are assigned to `cliquess`.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Global Variables**:
   - The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are used globally within `make_array`. This could lead to issues if the function is called multiple times (e.g., in different test cases) because the same global variables are modified.
   
2. **Correctness of Clique Assignment**:
   - The logic for assigning integers and cliques seems correct in terms of distributing values symmetrically, but it does not guarantee that the resulting graph will be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The calculation of `cliques = ceil(n / k)` is a heuristic, and it does not necessarily yield the optimal number of cliques.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle edge cases explicitly. For example, if `n` is very small or `k` is very large, the behavior might not be as expected.
   
4. **Output Format**:
   - The code prints the required output, but the correctness of the output depends on the correctness of the clique assignment and the integer assignment.

### Conclusion
While the code attempts to solve the problem, it does not guarantee the optimal solution for the minimum number of cliques. The use of global variables and the heuristic approach for determining the number of cliques are potential issues.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
