Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the integer obtained from the new input; `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the new `arr`; `first` is False; `i` is the value that causes the loop to break.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be at least 0, and `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` with the value 1 if and only if `first` is True. If `mpp[i]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change in the state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement. If `mpp[i] == 1`, `first` is set to True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be at least 0, and `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the loop or if statement continues to execute.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
