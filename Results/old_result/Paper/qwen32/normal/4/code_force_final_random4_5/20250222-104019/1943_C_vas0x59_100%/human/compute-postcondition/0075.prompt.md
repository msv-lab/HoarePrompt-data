You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: u2vs is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index, n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and u and v are integers representing the vertices connected by an edge such that 0 <= u, v < n.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` inclusive, where the last vertex in the list is `a` and `previous[a]` is `-1`.

    #State: `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree; `d` is a list of distances from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `previous` is a list that tracks the path taken to reach each vertex from vertex `a`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` inclusive, where the last vertex in the list is `a` and `previous[a]` is `-1`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, the state of `ops` remains unchanged (empty). If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing `len(path_ba) // 2` elements, each being a tuple `(c1, i)` or `(c2, i)` where `i` increments by 2 each time; `ci2` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `ci1` is the integer value of `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`; `c1` is `path_ba[ci1]`; `c2` is `path_ba[ci2]`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(ops) (where len(ops) is 0 if the length of path_ba is odd, and len(path_ba) // 2 if the length of path_ba is even)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: path_ba[0]+1 0
    return None
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts parameters `u2vs`, `n`, `u`, and `v`. `u2vs` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex index. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. `u` and `v` are integers representing the vertices connected by an edge such that 0 <= u, v < n. The function returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
