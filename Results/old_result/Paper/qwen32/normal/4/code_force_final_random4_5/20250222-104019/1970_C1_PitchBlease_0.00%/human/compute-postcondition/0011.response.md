Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i, and `tree[start]` must contain at least one neighbor; `queue` is a deque that may contain the previous elements plus a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in the `visited` set; `visited` is a set containing the `start` node, `current` node, and possibly other nodes; `current` is equal to `start` or another node in the tree; `dist` is a non-negative integer representing the distance from `start` to `current`; `neighbor` is a neighbor of `current`, and if `neighbor` was not in the `visited` set before this operation, it is now added to the `visited` set and `(neighbor, dist + 1)` is added to the `queue`. If `neighbor` was already in the `visited` set, the `queue` and `visited` sets remain unchanged. `current` is not equal to `target`.**
