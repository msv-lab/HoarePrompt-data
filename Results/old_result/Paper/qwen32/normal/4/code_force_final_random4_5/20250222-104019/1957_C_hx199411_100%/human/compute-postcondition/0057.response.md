The code snippet `num += 2` increments the value of `num` by 2. Given that `num` is either 1 or 2, after the increment, `num` will be either 3 or 4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is either 3 or 4, `m` is `n - num`, `i` is 1, `c` is the first integer from the new input, `r` is the second integer from the new input.**
