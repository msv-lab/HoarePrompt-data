To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the variables involved:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 2.
- `v2` is equal to `i`.

However, the variable `v1` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value from the given information. Therefore, we will represent `v1` as `v1` in the output.

Given this, the print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Since `v2` is equal to `i`, and `i` is the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 2, we can express `v2` as `i`. However, without knowing the exact value of `i` from the last iteration or the initial value of `i`, we can only describe `v2` in terms of `i`.

Output: **? v1 v1 i i (where v1 is the value of v1 and i is the value of i at the end of the last iteration plus 2)**
