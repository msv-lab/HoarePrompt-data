The code snippet `d -= 1` decrements the value of `d` by 1. The initial state describes `i` and `a[d]` and `a[g]` with specific conditions, but none of these are directly affected by the operation `d -= 1`. Therefore, only `d` changes.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `d` is `d - 1`; `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[g]` was originally 0, then `g` is `g + 1` and `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`. Otherwise, `a[g]` remains `int(a[g]) - 1`.**
In natural language: The value of `d` is decreased by 1. The values of `i`, `a[d]`, and the conditions related to `a[g]` remain as described in the initial state.
