The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range of the loop, which is 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` ten times; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` ten times; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the last input string by spaces; `i` is 1. If the current value of `x[i]` is less than the current value of `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. Otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.**
