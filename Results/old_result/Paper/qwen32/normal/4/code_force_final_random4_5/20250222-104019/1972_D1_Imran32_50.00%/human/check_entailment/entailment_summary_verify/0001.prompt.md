You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

t = int(input())

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n

    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` which is `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` ranging from 2 to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one. It then prints the result `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the given program does not implement this logic. Instead, it seems to calculate a different quantity involving square roots and divisors, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, `func_1()` does not correctly parse the input for `n` and `m` for each test case. It reads `n` and `k` instead of `n` and `m`. This is a typo and the program should read `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The core logic in `func_1()` is completely unrelated to the problem. The program calculates `ans` based on the number of divisors and square roots, which does not match the problem's requirement of checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated `ans`, which is not the correct count of valid pairs for each test case.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This can be done efficiently by leveraging the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd).
