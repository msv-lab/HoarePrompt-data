Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is `1 - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[1]` is `a[1] - mi`, `mi` is `min(a[0], a[1])`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `r` is 1, `T` is 0, and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `l` remains 0, `r` remains 1, `T` remains 0, and `ans` is not changed. `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain in their initial state.
