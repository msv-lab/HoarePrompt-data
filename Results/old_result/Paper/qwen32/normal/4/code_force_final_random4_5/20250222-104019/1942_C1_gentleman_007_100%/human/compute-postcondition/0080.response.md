Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`. `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `l` is a list containing the characters of the LCS of `a` and `b` in reverse order.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the indices `i` and `j` will both be 0, indicating that the loop has traced back to the beginning of the strings `a` and `b`. The list `l` will contain the characters of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of `a` and `b`, but in reverse order, because characters are appended to `l` starting from the end of the LCS and moving towards the beginning. The `dp` table remains unchanged as it was initially, still containing the lengths of LCS for all prefixes of `a` and `b`.
