The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or the state outside of the loop. Given that there is no loop structure provided in the context, the `continue` statement in this context does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, none of the variables are changed by the `continue` statement. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `q` is greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the elements from `a[1]` to `a[n]` which are `int(data[index])` for each respective iteration; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `2n + 7`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries (either 'YES' or 'NO') with an additional 'YES'; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for each respective iteration; `mp` is a defaultdict where each key is a unique XOR value from `pf` and maps to a list of indices `i` where that XOR value was achieved; `l` is `int(data[2n + 5])`; `r` is `int(data[2n + 6])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and `x` equals 0.**
