The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1` (which means it has been incremented by 1 from the previous iteration). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 again.

Given that `j` is currently `i + 1`, for the next iteration, `j` should be `i + 2`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the new input string, `j` is `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `e` is the value of the input. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then either `k` is equal to `j + 1` or `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`.**
