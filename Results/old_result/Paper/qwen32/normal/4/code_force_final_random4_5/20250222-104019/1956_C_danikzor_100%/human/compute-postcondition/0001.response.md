To determine what will be printed by the given Python code, we need to analyze the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n` based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it is provided as input. The value of `n` is between 1 and 500 inclusive.

### Expression Breakdown:
1. **First part of the print statement: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`**
   - This is a formula often used to calculate the sum of squares of the first `n` natural numbers. The formula is:
     \[
     \text{Sum of squares} = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}
     \]
   - However, in this case, the formula is slightly different: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This suggests that the printed value is not the standard sum of squares but a different calculation that follows this specific formula.

2. **Second part of the print statement: `2 * n`**
   - This is simply twice the value of `n`.

### Output Description:
- The first part of the print statement computes a value based on the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. Since `n` is provided as input, this value will be computed based on that specific `n`.
- The second part of the print statement is simply `2 * n`.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the result of the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` followed by `2 * n`.

Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the number of test cases)**
