The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code reassigns the value of `n` to whatever integer the user inputs. The initial state mentions that `n` is already an input integer, but this line of code will overwrite that value with a new input.

The other variables, `t` and `ar`, are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` is a new input integer; `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input.**
