Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is equal to `low`. Additionally, `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means the execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
