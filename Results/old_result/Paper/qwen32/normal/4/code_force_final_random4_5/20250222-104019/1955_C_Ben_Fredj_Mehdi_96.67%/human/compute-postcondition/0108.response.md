Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is a list of integers; `n` and `k` retain their initial values unless specified otherwise. If `n` is equal to 5 and `k` is equal to 2147483648, the postcondition is the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `n` is equal to 20 and `k` is equal to 10000000000, or if `k` is equal to 5999999999, or if `k` is equal to 4294967295, the postcondition is the same as the precondition. If `n` is equal to 2, `k` is equal to `a[0] - 1`, and `k` is also equal to `a[1] - 2`, then no changes are made to `a`. If `k` is equal to 3000000000`, `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, `a` remains unchanged. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the start and the first `k // 2` non-zero elements from the end of `a` are each decremented by 1. Additionally, if `k % 2 == 1`, the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the start (`g`) and the next non-zero element after the last decrement from the end (`d`) are further decremented by 1.**
