The code snippet `heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))` pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` into the `max_heap`. Since `max_heap` is initially empty, after this operation, `max_heap` will contain this single tuple. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains `[(-diff1, i, 0)]`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, and `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**
