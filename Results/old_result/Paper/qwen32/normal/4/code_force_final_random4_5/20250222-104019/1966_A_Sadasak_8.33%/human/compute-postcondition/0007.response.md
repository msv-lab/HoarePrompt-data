Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 2 elements; `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; the length of `arr` (n) is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[num]` is `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; `num` is the next element in the list `arr`. The value of `frequency_table[num]` has been incremented by 1, but it will not exceed `k`.**

Natural Language: The value of `frequency_table[num]` has been increased by 1. If the new value of `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, it will be capped at `k`. All other conditions and variable states remain the same.
