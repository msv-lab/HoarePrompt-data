To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the variables and their descriptions based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `g` is initialized to 0, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `v1` is defined as the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`.
- `prev` is defined as the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was either `'>'` or `'='` followed by `'<'`.

Given these definitions, the print statement:
```python
print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
```
will output the values of `prev` and `v1` in the specified format.

Since the exact values of `prev` and `v1` are dependent on the user's responses and are not explicitly provided, the output will be described in terms of these variables.

Output: **! [prev] [v1] (where [prev] is the largest integer i from 1 to n-1 for which the user's response was '>' or '=' followed by '<', and [v1] is the largest integer i from 1 to n-1 for which the user's response was '<')**
