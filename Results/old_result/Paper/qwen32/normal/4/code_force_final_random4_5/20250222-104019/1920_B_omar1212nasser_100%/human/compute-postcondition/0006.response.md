Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `s2` is updated by subtracting the value of `elements[-i]` from it. The other variables remain unchanged unless derived from `s2`.

Here's the updated state:
- `removals` remains at least 1.
- `negatives` remains a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`).
- `elements` remains a list of integers.
- `pos` remains a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`.
- `s` remains the sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]`.
- `s2` is now the sum of `elements[-negatives:]` minus `elements[-i]`.

Output State: **`removals` is at least 1, `negatives` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of `elements` minus `elements[-i]`, `s2` is `s2 - elements[-i]`.**
