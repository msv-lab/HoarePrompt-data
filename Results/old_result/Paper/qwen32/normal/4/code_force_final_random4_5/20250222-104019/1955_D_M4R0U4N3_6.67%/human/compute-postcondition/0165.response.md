The code snippet adds the element at index `a[j]` to the set `done`. Given the initial state, `j` has already been incremented, `m` remains greater than `j`, and the element at index `a[j]` has been removed from `todo`. After the execution, the element `a[j]` is now part of the set `done`.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `m` must be greater than `j`, the element at index `a[j]` has been removed from `todo`, and `done` contains the element `a[j]`.**
