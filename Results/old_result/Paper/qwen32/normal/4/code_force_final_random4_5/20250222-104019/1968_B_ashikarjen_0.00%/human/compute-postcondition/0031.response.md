The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only affects the control flow by exiting the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Given the initial state, the values of `i`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `m`, and `j` is not less than `m` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
