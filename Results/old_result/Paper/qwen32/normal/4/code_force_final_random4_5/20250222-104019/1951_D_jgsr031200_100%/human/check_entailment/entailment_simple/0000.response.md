**Reasoning:**

The provided program is intended to determine whether Bob can set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins, given that she buys greedily from stall to stall.

However, the current implementation of the `func_1` function is flawed and does not correctly solve the problem. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:** The initial costs list is set to `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This is not a logical way to determine the prices of the jewels at the stalls. It does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly k jewels.

2. **Loop Logic:** The loop that calculates `h` and modifies `n` is incorrect. The variable `h` is supposed to count the number of jewels Alice buys, but the logic does not correctly simulate Alice's greedy buying behavior.

3. **Final Check:** The final check `if (h < k)` is not sufficient to determine if the setup is correct. The logic does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly k jewels.

4. **Output:** The output logic is incorrect. It does not provide a valid set of prices for the stalls that would ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels.

A correct approach would involve setting up the stalls with prices that ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels. One possible strategy is to use a greedy approach by setting up stalls with decreasing prices, starting from a price that allows Alice to buy as many jewels as possible without exceeding her coins.

**Correctness: False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly k jewels with her n coins, and the output logic is incorrect.
