The provided code snippet initializes a new set `st`. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`) are affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is the first value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1; `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, and `st` is an empty set.**
