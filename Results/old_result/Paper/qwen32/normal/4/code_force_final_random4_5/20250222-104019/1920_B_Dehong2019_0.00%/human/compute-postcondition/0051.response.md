The code snippet provided is `ans1 += a[i]`. This means the value of `ans1` is updated by adding the value of `a[i]` to it.

Given the initial state, `ans1` is initially calculated as:
- `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2]) + a[i] - a[i + x] * 2` if `i + x` is less than `n`
- `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2]) + a[i]` otherwise

After executing `ans1 += a[i]`, the new value of `ans1` will be:
- `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2]) + a[i] - a[i + x] * 2 + a[i]` if `i + x` is less than `n`
- `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2]) + a[i] + a[i]` otherwise

Simplifying, the new value of `ans1` will be:
- `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2]) + 2 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 2` if `i + x` is less than `n`
- `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2]) + 2 * a[i]` otherwise

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order as read from the input; `i` is `k + x - 2`; if `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2]) + 2 * a[i] - a[i + x] * 2` and `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2])`; otherwise, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2]) + 2 * a[i]` and `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[k-1] + a[k] + ... + a[k + x - 2])`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` observed during the loop.**
