The code snippet `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `l` was 0, so after the increment, `l` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`r`, `a`, `end`, `ans`, `n`, `le`, and `st`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is 1, `l` is 1, `a` is a list where the first two elements are the same, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `st` is 1**.
