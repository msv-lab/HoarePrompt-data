The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is the loop counter and will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so we don't need to adjust its state before the loop begins.

Given the conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000 (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop).
- `n` is the input integer (This variable is part of the loop head and affects the execution of the loop).
- `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, and `p_i` != `i` (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop).

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, and `p_i` != `i`**
