The print statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('99999')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'99999'`. The value to be printed is explicitly provided as a string literal within the `print` function and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, or `k` described in the initial state.

Thus, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **99999**
