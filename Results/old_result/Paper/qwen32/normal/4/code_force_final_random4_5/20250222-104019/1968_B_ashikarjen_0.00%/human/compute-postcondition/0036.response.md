To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]`.

1. **Condition `j < m`**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is 1. 
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. Therefore, `m` needs to be greater than `j`, which is currently 1. So, `m` should be at least 2.

2. **Condition `b[j] != a[i]`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, `a[1]` is 5, and `b[0]` is 3.
   - Since `j` is 1, we need to ensure that `b[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`. Currently, we don't have information about `b[1]`, so we need to make sure `b[1]` is not equal to 5.

Based on these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is greater than 1 and `b[1]` is not equal to 5.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `a[1]` is 5, `b[0]` is 3, `b[1]` is not equal to 5**
