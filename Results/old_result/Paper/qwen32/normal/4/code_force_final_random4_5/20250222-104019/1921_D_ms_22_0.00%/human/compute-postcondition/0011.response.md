The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99; `n` and `m` are input integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each split substring to an integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting a new input string, converting each split substring to an integer, and sorting the resulting list in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0.**
