The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop depends on the variable `t`, which determines the number of iterations. Since the loop head does not contain `t`, we don't need to adjust it directly. However, we need to ensure that `t` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers.
- `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- `idx` is `3 + n + n`.
- `t` is an integer value greater than 1.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `result` and the value of `result` again.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1 - n]`.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 so that it remains greater than 0.

State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from `data` starting at index `idx` to `idx + n` to integers; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is `3 + n + n`; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result` and the value of `result` again; `n` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1 - n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(a)`**
