The code snippet updates the value of `m` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`, `k` is `L[2]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
