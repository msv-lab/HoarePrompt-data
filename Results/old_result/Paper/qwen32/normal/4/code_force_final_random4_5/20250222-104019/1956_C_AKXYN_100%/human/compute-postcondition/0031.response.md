The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, the expression evaluates to `(3 + 1) * (2 * 3 + 1)`, which is `4 * 7`, resulting in `28`. Therefore, `res` becomes `21 + 28`, which is `49`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 3, `mat` is a matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 49, `i` is 3**.
