To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the condition that controls the loop: `while 2 ** i <= x:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `2` raised to the power of `i` is less than or equal to `x`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `i` is 1, and `x` must be at least 1.
- After 2 iterations: `i` is 2, and `x` must be at least 2.
- After 3 iterations: `i` is 3, and `x` must be at least 4.

The loop will stop when `2 ** i` exceeds `x`. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the smallest integer such that `2 ** i > x`. In other words, `i` will be `floor(log2(x)) + 1`.

Let's denote the final value of `i` as `i_final`. The loop will terminate when `2 ** i_final > x`, and `i_final` will be the first integer that satisfies this condition.

Since the other variables (`t`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`) are not modified within the loop, their values remain unchanged.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `t` is equal to `x`
- `x` remains the same
- `i` will be `i_final`, which is the smallest integer such that `2 ** i_final > x`
- `subseq_lens` contains the value 1
- `mx` is at least 1

To express this in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is equal to `x`, `x` remains the same, `i` is the smallest integer such that `2 ** i > x`, `subseq_lens` contains the value 1, and `mx` is at least 1.**

In simpler natural language: The final state is that `t` still equals `x`, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is the smallest integer where `2` raised to `i` is greater than `x`, `subseq_lens` still contains the value 1, and `mx` remains at least 1.
