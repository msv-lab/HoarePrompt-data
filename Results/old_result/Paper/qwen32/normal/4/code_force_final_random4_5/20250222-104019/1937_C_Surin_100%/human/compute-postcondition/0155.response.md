Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v2` is `i`, `prev` is the largest `i` for which the user input was `'>'` or `'='` and the subsequent comparison with `prev` resulted in `'<'`, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `r` is an input string. If `r` equals `'<'`, then `v1` is `i`. Otherwise, `v1` retains its initial value of 0.**
