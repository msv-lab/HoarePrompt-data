To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the relationships between the variables.

### Given Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `ar` is a list of integers.
4. `i` is `len(ar)`.
5. `num` is the last unique element in `ar`.
6. `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements.
7. `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`.
8. `minn` is neither equal to infinity nor equal to the length of `ar`.

### Analysis:
- `ar` is a list of integers.
- `i` is the length of the list `ar`.
- `num` is the last unique element in `ar`, meaning it is the last element that doesn't repeat consecutively.
- `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`. For example, if `ar` ends with [3, 3, 3], then `same` would be 3.
- `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. Since `minn` is neither infinity nor the length of `ar`, it means `minn` has been updated at least once during the execution of the program to reflect the smallest count of consecutive equal elements encountered so far.
  
### What is printed:
The `print(minn)` statement will output the value of `minn`, which is the smallest count of consecutive equal elements encountered in the list `ar`.

### Final Output:
Output: **minn (where minn is the smallest count of consecutive equal elements in the list ar)**
