The provided code snippet `c0 += coef0[j]` modifies the variable `c0` by adding the value of `coef0[j]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless `coef0[j]` has a specific value.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists where each element is derived from the i-th input.
- `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` as `True`, and possibly `visited[0]` as `True`.
- `coef0` is a list of `None` values with `coef0[1]` potentially updated, and possibly `coef0[0]` as `0`.
- `coef1` is a list of `None` values with `coef1[1]` potentially updated, and possibly `coef1[0]` as `1`.
- `nodes` is a list with at least one element.
- `i` is 1.
- `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `dfs(i)` modifies it.
- `c0` is `0`.
- `c1` is `0`.

The variable `j` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we assume `j` is a valid index for the `coef0` list, and `coef0[j]` has a specific value that we need to consider for the output state.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` which is `True` and possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with `coef0[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if it was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with `coef1[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if it was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which must have at least one element; `i` is 1; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `dfs(i)` modifies it; `c0` is `0` plus `coef0[j]`; `c1` is `0`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `c0` is now the sum of its initial value (0) and `coef0[j]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
