Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: - `a` remains the list returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `n` and `q` remain the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `l` and `r` remain the integers representing the start and end indices of a subarray such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
- `x` is `[0] + [cumulative XOR results]` where each element is the XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`.
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs.

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
    if upper > lower:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` remains the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` remain the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0] + [cumulative XOR results]` where each element is the XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs. `lower` is assigned the value of `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`. `upper` is assigned the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, then `upper` remains greater than `lower`. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` remains the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` remain the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0] + [cumulative XOR results]` where each element is the XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs. `lower` is assigned the value of `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`. `upper` is assigned the value of `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. The condition `upper > lower` determines whether the if block or the else block is executed, but both blocks result in the same state of variables after execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` remains the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `n` and `q` remain the values returned by `func_1(int)` where `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are the new values returned by `func_1(int)` such that `1 <= l < r <= n`, `x` is `[0] + [cumulative XOR results]` where each element is the XOR of the previous element in `x` with the next element in `a`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a unique XOR result from `x`, and each value is a list of indices in `x` where that XOR result occurs, `lower` is recalculated based on the new `l` and `r` as `inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]`, `upper` is recalculated based on the new `l` and `r` as `inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x[l - 1] == x[r]`, then the conditions remain as stated; otherwise, there is no change in the variables. Whether `upper > lower` or not, the variables `a`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `inds`, `lower`, `upper`, and `i` are updated as described, and `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
