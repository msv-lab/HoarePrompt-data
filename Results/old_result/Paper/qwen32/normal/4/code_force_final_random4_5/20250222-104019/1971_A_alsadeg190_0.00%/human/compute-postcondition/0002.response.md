The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. This means that the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input provided. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.**
