The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0
- `x` is an integer obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order
- `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the first element of `a`
- `ans2` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`
- `i` is 0 and `i + x` is less than `n`

The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from it. Since `i` is 0, this means `ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[x]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0; `x` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus the first element of `a` minus `2 * a[x]`; `ans2` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `i` is 0 and `i + x` is less than `n`**.
