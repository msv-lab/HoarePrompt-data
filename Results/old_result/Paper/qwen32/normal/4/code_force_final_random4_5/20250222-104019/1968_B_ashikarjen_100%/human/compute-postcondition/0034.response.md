For the given task, we need to ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once. The condition for the loop to execute is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`. 

Let's break down the variables involved in the loop condition:
- `j` is the index in the binary string `b`.
- `m` is the length of the binary string `b`.
- `a` is the input string.
- `i` is the index in the string `a` and is initially set to 1.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure:
1. `j < m` is true.
2. `b[j] != a[i]` is true.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is the string read from the input.
- `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input.
- `i` is 1.
- If `j` is less than `m` (indicating a match was found such that `b[j] == a[0]`), `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `j` is equal to `m` and `k` is set to 0, indicating no match was found.

Since `i` is initially set to 1, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[1]`.

Let's assume the worst-case scenario where `j` could be `m-1` (the last index of `b`), but we need to ensure `j < m` and `b[j] != a[1]`. To make sure the loop can execute, we can set `j` to a value less than `m` and ensure `b[j]` is not equal to `a[1]`.

The simplest way to ensure this is to set `j` to 0 (the first index of `b`) and ensure `b[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string read from the input; `b` is the new binary string of length `m` read from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is 0; `b[0]` is not equal to `a[1]`**
