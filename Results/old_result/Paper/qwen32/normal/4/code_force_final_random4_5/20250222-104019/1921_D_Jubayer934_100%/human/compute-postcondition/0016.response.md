The code snippet appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. No other variables are modified directly by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `ans` will be updated to include this new element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`. If `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1. `ans` is a list containing `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.**

In natural language: The output state remains the same as the initial state with the exception that the list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
