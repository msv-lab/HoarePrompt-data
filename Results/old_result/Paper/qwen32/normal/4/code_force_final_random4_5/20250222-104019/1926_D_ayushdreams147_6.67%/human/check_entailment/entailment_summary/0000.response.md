Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups required based on the problem's constraints. The problem requires that for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations should not have matching bits in positions 1 through 31. However, the function `func_1` incorrectly uses a bitwise XOR operation and a count mechanism that does not properly address this requirement.

The function attempts to check for the presence of bitwise-flipped numbers, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach would involve checking each bit position from 1 to 31 to ensure that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit value at any of these positions. This requires a more sophisticated algorithm, such as using a graph coloring approach or a set-based method to track the groups.

The execution summary provided does not accurately describe the intended functionality of the program, and the output of the program does not match the expected results for the given examples.

Correctness: **False**
