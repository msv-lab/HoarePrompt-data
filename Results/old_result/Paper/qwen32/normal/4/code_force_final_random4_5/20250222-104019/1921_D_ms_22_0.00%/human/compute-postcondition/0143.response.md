The code snippet adds the positive value of `difference` (which is `-item[0]` since `item` is a tuple `(-difference, i, index)`) to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` is increased by the `difference` value of the tuple `item` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple `(-difference, i, index)`; `item` is the tuple `(-difference, i, index)` that was the smallest in the heap, which corresponds to the largest `difference` value; `ans` is increased by `difference`.**
