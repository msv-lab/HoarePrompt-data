The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state includes information about multiple test cases, but the code snippet only processes the first integer input which represents the number of test cases (`t`). Therefore, after executing the code snippet, `n` will hold the value of `t`, the number of test cases.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `n` lines contains a single integer representing the size of the matrix `a` for that test case. The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.**
