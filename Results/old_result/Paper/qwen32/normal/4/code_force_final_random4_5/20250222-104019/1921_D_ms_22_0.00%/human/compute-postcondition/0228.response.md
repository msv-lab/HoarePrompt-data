Postcondition: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`. If `item[2] < tp1` or `item[2] > tp2`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`. If `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff1`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is increased by `diff2`. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is updated by adding the positive value of `item[0]` to it. If `item[2] == tp1`, `tp1` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.**
