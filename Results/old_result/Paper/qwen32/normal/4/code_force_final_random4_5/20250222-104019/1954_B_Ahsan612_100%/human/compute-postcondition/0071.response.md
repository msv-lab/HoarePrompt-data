Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a new list of integers with at least 6 elements. If `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `same` is 4, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `i` is 4 if `ar[i]` was equal to `num` otherwise `i` is 5, `num` is `ar[3]` if `i` was 3 otherwise `ar[4]`, `same` is 2 if `i` was 3, `same` is 1 if `i` was not 3, `minn` is 2 if `i` was 3, `minn` is 3 if `i` was not 3, and `minn` is 1 if `ar[i]` was not equal to `num` and `i` was not 3.**
