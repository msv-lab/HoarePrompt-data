### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. The logic of the program is to find the shortest sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the array, as removing all elements from such a sequence would ensure that the array is no longer beautiful.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of the current sequence of identical numbers.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity to store the minimum length of any sequence of identical numbers found.

2. **Iterating through the array**:
   - The program iterates over the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element matches `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element does not match `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - The iteration continues, and `same` is incremented for each consecutive identical element.

3. **Final update**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time to consider the sequence that ends at the last element of the array.

4. **Decision making**:
   - If `minn` is still infinity (which means no sequence was found) or if `minn` equals the length of the array (which means the entire array consists of identical elements), the program outputs `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`, which is the length of the shortest sequence of identical numbers that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Analysis of the Execution States:

Let's analyze the given test cases:

1. **Test case 1**:
   - Input: `3 2 2 2`
   - The array is already composed of identical elements. The shortest sequence of identical numbers is the entire array itself. Therefore, `minn` will be 3, but since `minn == len(ar)`, the output is `-1`.

2. **Test case 2**:
   - Input: `5 1 2 1 2 1`
   - The array has sequences of identical numbers of length 1. The shortest sequence of identical numbers is 1. Removing one element from any of these sequences (e.g., removing the second element '2') will make the array non-beautiful. Hence, the output is `1`.

3. **Test case 3**:
   - Input: `1 1`
   - The array consists of a single element. The shortest sequence of identical numbers is the entire array itself. Therefore, `minn` will be 1, but since `minn == len(ar)`, the output is `-1`.

4. **Test case 4**:
   - Input: `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
   - The array has sequences of identical numbers of lengths 3 and 1. The shortest sequence of identical numbers is 1. Removing all elements from any sequence of length 3 (e.g., removing the first three elements '3 3 3') will make the array non-beautiful. Hence, the output is `3`.

The program's logic correctly identifies the shortest sequence of identical numbers and handles edge cases where the entire array consists of identical elements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
