Postcondition: **The input consists of a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, where `t` is equal to `x`. Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}) representing the number of increasing subsequences required for that test case. `subseq_lens` is an empty list. `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i - 1` if `i` is not 0; otherwise, `i` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 2.**
