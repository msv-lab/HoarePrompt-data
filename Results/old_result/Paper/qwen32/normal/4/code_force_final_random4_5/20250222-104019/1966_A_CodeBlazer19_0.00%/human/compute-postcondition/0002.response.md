The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500 and `i` is 0. After executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the values from the input, and the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `i` is 0, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer.**
