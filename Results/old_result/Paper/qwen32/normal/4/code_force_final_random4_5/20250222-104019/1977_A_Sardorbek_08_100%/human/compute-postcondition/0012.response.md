Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers provided by the input; `q` is a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c`. Additionally, `b` is not equal to `c` and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. `b` and `c` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd).**
