The code snippet `y = 0` sets the variable `y` to 0. The values of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[0]`**.
