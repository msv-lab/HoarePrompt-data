The code snippet `v1 = 0` directly assigns the value `0` to the variable `v1`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `g`, `prev`, or `kp`.

Output State: **`n` is the new integer input by the user, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `prev` is the largest `i` for which the user input was `'>'` or `'='` and the subsequent comparison with `prev` resulted in `'<'`, `kp` is `kp + 1`.**
