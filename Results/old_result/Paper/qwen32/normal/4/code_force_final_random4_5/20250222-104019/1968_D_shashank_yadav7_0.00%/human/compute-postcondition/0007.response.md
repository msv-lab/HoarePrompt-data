The variable `sp` is assigned the value of `a[s]`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s-1`, `b`, `p`, and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`.**
