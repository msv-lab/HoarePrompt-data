The code snippet increments the value of `st` by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`r` is 1, `l` is 1, `a` is a list where the first two elements are the same, `end` is 1, `ans` is `max(0, le - 2n)` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `le - n`, `n` is the new input integer, `le` is the length of the new `a`, `st` is 2**
