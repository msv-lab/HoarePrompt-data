To determine the state before the for loop starts, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The only variable that directly impacts the execution of the loop is the return value of `func_10()`. 

The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, its initial value does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is the return value of `func_10()`. To ensure the loop executes, `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer**
