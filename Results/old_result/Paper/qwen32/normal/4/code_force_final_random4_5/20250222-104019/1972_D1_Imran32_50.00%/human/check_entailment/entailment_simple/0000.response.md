Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the provided program does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates a value based on the sum of a series of divisions, which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` (which should be `m` according to the problem description), calculates a value `ans` based on the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` from 2 to `root` (where `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`), and prints this value. This calculation does not determine the number of valid pairs (a, b) as specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
