The value of `v2` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `v2` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `v2` is equal to `i`.**
