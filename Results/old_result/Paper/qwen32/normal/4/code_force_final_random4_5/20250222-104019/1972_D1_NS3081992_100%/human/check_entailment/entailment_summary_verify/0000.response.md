### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Code Analysis:
The function `func_15()` attempts to solve this problem using the following logic:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

Let's break down the logic:
- The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) as long as \(i * i \leq n + i\).
- For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to the answer.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

#### Issues in the Code:
The loop condition and the calculation inside the loop do not correctly address the problem requirements. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly handled.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), determine the valid values of \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach involves iterating over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\):
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
2. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. Count the valid pairs.

However, the provided code `func_15()` does not follow this approach. Instead, it uses a loop with a condition `i * i <= n + i` and performs a calculation that doesn't correctly determine the number of valid pairs.

#### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case:
```
1
10 8
```
The expected output is 14, but the provided code will not produce this result due to the incorrect logic in `func_15()`.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not correctly handle the problem for all potential cases, the correctness is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
