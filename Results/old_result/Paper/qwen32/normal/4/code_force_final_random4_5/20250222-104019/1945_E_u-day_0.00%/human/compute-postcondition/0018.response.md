The code adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Since `mid` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`, and `n` must be greater than 2, `mid` will be a specific integer value. The set `st` will now contain this value.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1; `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2`, and `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**
