The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of the current value of `bx` and the value of `x`. 

Given the initial state:
- If `a` is 1, `bx` was initially set to `max(x, -1)`. After executing the code, `bx` will be the maximum of `x` and `max(x, -1)`, which will simply be `x` if `x` is greater than -1, or `-1` if `x` is less than or equal to -1. However, since `x` is from the input and no specific constraints are given on its minimum value, we can say `bx` will be `max(x, -1)`.
- If `a` is 2, `bx` was initially set to `-1`. After executing the code, `bx` will be the maximum of `x` and `-1`, which will be `x` if `x` is greater than -1, or `-1` if `x` is less than or equal to -1.

Therefore, the updated value of `bx` will be `max(x, -1)` in both cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `a` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input; `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the value `x`; `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)` if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007; `bx` is `max(x, -1)`**.
