To determine what the `print` statement will output, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: A positive integer between 1 and 500. (Not directly relevant to the print statement)
2. **`n`**: Must be greater than 0. (Determines the size of the matrix and the range in the print statement)
3. **`mat`**: A matrix with `n` rows and `n` columns where each row contains integers from 1 to `n`. (Not directly relevant to the print statement)
4. **`res`**: The sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. (Not directly relevant to the print statement)
5. **`i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly set to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- **`'1 %d' % i`**: This is a string formatting operation where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The value of `i` (which is 2) will replace `%d`. So, `'1 %d' % i` will result in the string `'1 2'`.
- **`*range(1, n + 1)`**: The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, meaning each number in the sequence will be passed as a separate argument to the `print` function. Therefore, if `n` is 5, `*range(1, n + 1)` will be equivalent to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### Combining the Parts:
- The `print` statement will first print the string `'1 2'` (from `'1 %d' % i`).
- Then, it will print the numbers from 1 to `n` (from `*range(1, n + 1)`).

### Final Output:
The exact output depends on the value of `n`, which is not explicitly given. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **1 2 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the number of columns in the matrix `mat`)**

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`. If `n` were known, we could substitute it in to get the exact sequence of numbers.

For example, if `n` were 5, the output would be:
Output: **1 2 1 2 3 4 5**

However, given the information provided, the most precise description is:
Output: **1 2 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the number of columns in the matrix `mat`)**
