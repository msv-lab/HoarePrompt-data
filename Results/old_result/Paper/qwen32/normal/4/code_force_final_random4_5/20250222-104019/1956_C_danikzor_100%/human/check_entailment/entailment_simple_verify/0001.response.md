### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

**Problem Analysis:**
- The goal is to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
- Each operation involves filling a row or a column with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

**Key Points:**
- **Type 1 Operation**: Fills a row with a permutation.
- **Type 2 Operation**: Fills a column with a permutation.
- **Objective**: Maximize the sum of the matrix elements.

**Optimal Strategy:**
- To maximize the sum, we need to use permutations that maximize the values in the matrix.
- The best strategy is to fill each row and each column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) because this permutation uses the largest possible numbers.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
- It calculates the maximum possible sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
- It performs \( 2n \) operations:
  - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
  - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

**Verification:**
- **Sum Calculation**: The formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \) is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers multiplied by \( n \) (for each row) and then summed up again for each column. This formula is correct for the maximum possible sum achievable with the given constraints.
- **Operations**: The program performs exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
- **Permutations**: The permutations used are optimal for maximizing the sum, as they fill each row and column with the largest possible values.

**Annotations:**
- The annotations confirm that the program reads the input correctly and performs the operations as intended.
- The state of the program after each operation is consistent with the intended behavior.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum and performs the required operations to achieve this sum within the given constraints. The annotations support the correctness of the program's behavior.
