Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that a >= 1, `b` and `c` are integers read from the input, and `q` is a tuple (`b`, `c`). If `b < c`, the state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q` also remains unchanged.**
