The `print` statement will output a question mark followed by the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. According to the initial state, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers that satisfy the condition \(0 \leq a, b, c, d < n\), where \(n\) is the length of the secret sequence `p`. However, the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, only their range.

Therefore, the output will be the question mark followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` as they are defined in the initial state.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n)**
