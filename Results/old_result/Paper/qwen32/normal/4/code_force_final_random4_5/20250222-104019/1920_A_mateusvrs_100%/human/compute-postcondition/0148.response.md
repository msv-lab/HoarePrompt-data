To determine what will be printed by the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the `print` statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `r` contains the final results for all `t` test cases.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*r, sep='\n')
```

### Explanation:
- The `*r` in the `print` statement is the unpacking operator. It unpacks the elements of the list `r` so that each element is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
- The `sep='\n'` argument specifies that the separator between the elements should be a newline character (`\n`).

### What Will Be Printed:
- Since `r` contains the final results for all `t` test cases, and each element of `r` is printed on a new line due to the `sep='\n'` argument, the output will be each element of the list `r` printed on a separate line.

### Output:
Output: **each element of the list `r` printed on a new line**
