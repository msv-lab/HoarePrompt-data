### Reasoning:
To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify if the functions `func_1` and `dfs` correctly implement the logic to solve the given problem.

The problem requires determining if it's possible to adjust the radii of the disks such that:
1. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.
2. No two disks overlap.
3. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

The provided code uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore connected components of disks that are tangent to each other. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

- **Initialization**: 
  - `n` is the number of disks.
  - `x`, `y`, and `r` store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
  - `visited` keeps track of which disks have been visited during the DFS.
  - `coef0` and `coef1` are used to store coefficients related to the connected components.
  - `nodes` is a list that stores the indices of disks in the current connected component.

- **DFS Function**:
  - The `dfs` function explores disks that are tangent to the current disk `i`.
  - It updates the `visited` list to mark disks as visited.
  - It populates the `nodes` list with indices of disks in the same connected component.
  - It updates `coef0` and `coef1` based on the radius of the current disk and the disk being explored.

- **Main Function (`func_1`)**:
  - It reads the input values.
  - It iterates through each disk and uses DFS to explore connected components.
  - For each connected component, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1`.
  - If `c1` (sum of `coef1` for the connected component) is not zero, it sets `ok` to `True`.
  - If `ok` is `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The key point here is the condition `c1 != 0` which determines if it's possible to adjust the radii while satisfying the problem constraints. The logic seems to be based on the idea that if there is at least one connected component where the sum of `coef1` is not zero, it indicates that the radii can be adjusted to meet the problem's requirements.

However, the provided execution summary does not explicitly state how the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine the possibility of adjusting the radii. The coefficients seem to be related to the feasibility of adjusting the radii while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions, but the exact mathematical basis is not provided in the summary.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided code and the execution summary, the logic appears to be correctly implemented based on the described approach. However, without a full mathematical proof or more detailed explanation of the coefficients, we can only assume that the provided logic is correct based on the problem's requirements.

Therefore, based on the given information and the logical flow of the code, the program seems to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
