The code snippet `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **Each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18) where a and b represent the frequency of launching fireworks for the first and second installations, respectively, and m represents the duration for which each firework is visible in the sky. There are `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) test cases. `t` is an input integer.**
