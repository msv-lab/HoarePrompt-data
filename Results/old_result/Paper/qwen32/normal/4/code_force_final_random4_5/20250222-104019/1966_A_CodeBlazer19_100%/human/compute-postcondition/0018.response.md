The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the new input, but the other variables (`t`, `i`, `l`, and `p`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `l` is a new list of integers read from the input; `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`. The maximum value in `p` is either greater than or equal to `k` or less than `k`.**
