Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input. `tp1` is `m`, `tp2` is `0`, and `ans` is the total accumulated difference.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `max_heap` is empty because all elements have been processed. The variable `t` remains greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n` as per the initial conditions. The variables `n` and `m`, which represent the sizes of the lists `a` and `b` respectively, remain unchanged. The list `a` of integers and the sorted list `b` are also unchanged. The variable `tp1` reaches `m` (indicating all elements from the start of `b` have been considered), and `tp2` reaches `0` (indicating all elements from the end of `b` have been considered). The variable `ans` holds the total accumulated difference calculated during the loop's execution.
