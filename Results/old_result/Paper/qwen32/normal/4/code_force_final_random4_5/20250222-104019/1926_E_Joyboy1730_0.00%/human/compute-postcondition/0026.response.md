Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` â‰¥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is `k - tot`; `L` is a list with at least one element; `pow` is 2; `tot` is increased by `a`; `a` is `a_next`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `pow`, `tot`, and `a` remain unchanged by the `break` statement. The only impact is that the program execution will exit the most internal loop or if statement.
