### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. We need to determine the minimum number of cells to color based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \).

The key insight is that:
- If \( k \leq 2n \), then the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). This is because we can color one cell in each of the diagonals, and for every two diagonals, we can share a cell.
- If \( k > 2n \), then the minimum number of cells needed is \( \lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor + 1 \). This is because after coloring \( 2n \) diagonals with \( n \) cells (one cell per pair of diagonals), we still need to color \( k - 2n \) more diagonals, and each additional diagonal will require at least one more cell.

Let's verify the program logic against the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case (n=3, k=4)**:
   - \( k = 4 \leq 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
   - Minimum cells needed: \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \)

2. **Second Test Case (n=3, k=3)**:
   - \( k = 3 \leq 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
   - Minimum cells needed: \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)

3. **Third Test Case (n=3, k=10)**:
   - \( k = 10 > 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
   - Minimum cells needed: \( \lfloor \frac{10}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \)

4. **Fourth Test Case (n=3, k=9)**:
   - \( k = 9 > 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
   - Minimum cells needed: \( \lfloor \frac{9}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \)

5. **Fifth Test Case (n=4, k=7)**:
   - \( k = 7 > 2 \times 4 = 8 \)
   - Minimum cells needed: \( \lfloor \frac{7}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 \)

6. **Sixth Test Case (n=7, k=11)**:
   - \( k = 11 > 2 \times 7 = 14 \)
   - Minimum cells needed: \( \lfloor \frac{11}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \)

7. **Seventh Test Case (n=2, k=3)**:
   - \( k = 3 \leq 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
   - Minimum cells needed: \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)

The program correctly computes the minimum number of cells to color for each test case based on the logic described above. Therefore, the program is correct.
