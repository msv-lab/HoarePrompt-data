The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + str(y)` appends the string representation of `y` to the string `kq1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `q`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as per the given initial state. The only change is in the value of `kq1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a string provided by user input with length at least 1; `b` is a string provided by user input; `q` is `q + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`**.
