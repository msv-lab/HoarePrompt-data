The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last value that made the loop condition true, and `n` must be greater than 0.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value. The state of `n` remains the same unless specified otherwise.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `x` such that `x < n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be `x + 1` and `n` should still be greater than `x + 1`.

Given the information, we can state:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and if `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `i` is `i + 1`**

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can represent the state in terms of the next value of `i`:

State: **`n` must be greater than the current `i` + 1, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and if `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `i` is incremented by 1**

For clarity, let's assume `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, then the next state would be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and if `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `i` is 1**

However, since we need a general form without assuming the specific value of `i`:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and if `arr[i]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` is set to `i`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1. `i` is `i + 1`**

Given that we need to strictly adhere to the variables in the loop head, the final state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**
