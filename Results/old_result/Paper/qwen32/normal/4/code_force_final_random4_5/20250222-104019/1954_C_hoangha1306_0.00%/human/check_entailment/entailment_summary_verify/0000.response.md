### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the product of two numbers `x` and `y` by swapping corresponding digits.
- **Input**: Two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
- **Output**: Two lines for each test case â€” the modified `x` and `y` that maximize the product.

### Program Analysis:
The program iterates through each digit of the input numbers `x` and `y` and constructs two new numbers `kq1` and `kq2` as follows:
- If the digits at position `i` in `x` and `y` are the same, it appends them directly to `kq1` and `kq2`.
- If the digits are different, it uses a variable `vt` to alternate the assignment of the larger and smaller digits between `kq1` and `kq2`.

### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it constructs two new strings:
  - One where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding digits from `x` and `y` (with the first differing digit being the larger of the two).
  - Another where each digit is the minimum of the corresponding digits from `x` and `y` (with the first differing digit being the smaller of the two).
- It then prints these two strings for each test case.

### Evaluation:
Let's evaluate the program based on the function summary and the provided test cases.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Digit Swapping Logic**: The program correctly swaps the digits to maximize the product.
2. **Handling Equal Digits**: If the digits are the same, it simply appends them to the resulting strings.
3. **Alternating Swap Strategy**: The variable `vt` is used to alternate the swapping strategy between the two numbers.
