The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the integer provided by `input()`, which is `t` in this case. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the loop's continuation, we only need to consider `t`.

Given that `t` is the number of iterations and it is decremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input. If `n` > 1, then `ans1` is equal to `a * n` and `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `n` is equal to 1.

Since `t` is the controlling variable for the number of iterations, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input. If `n` > 1, then `ans1` is equal to `a * n` and `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `n` is equal to 1**.

However, to be more precise, since `t` must remain within the range 1 to 10^4 for the loop to execute, and we are at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be exactly one less than its previous value:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `t` is decremented by 1 from its previous value; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input. If `n` > 1, then `ans1` is equal to `a * n` and `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `n` is equal to 1**.

To simplify, if `t` was the value at the end of the previous iteration, the start of the next iteration should have:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input. If `n` > 1, then `ans1` is equal to `a * n` and `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `n` is equal to 1**.
