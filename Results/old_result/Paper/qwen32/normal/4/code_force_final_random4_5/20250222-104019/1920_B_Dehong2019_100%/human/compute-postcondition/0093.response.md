Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a value based on the provided constraints and logic for each test case. Specifically, if the conditions related to `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a` are met, it returns a specific result for each test case.**
