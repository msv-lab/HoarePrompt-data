Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. Here, `n` is the number of elements in the list `nums`, `k` is an integer, and `nums` is a list of integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `nums`, the function returns `n`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of times the cumulative sum of elements from the start and from the end of `nums` are less than or equal to `ceil(k/2)` and `k//2`, respectively, and returns this count.**
