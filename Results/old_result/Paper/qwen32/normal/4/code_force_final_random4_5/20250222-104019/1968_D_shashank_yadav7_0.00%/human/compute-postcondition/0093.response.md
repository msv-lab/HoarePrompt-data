To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and the conditions under which it terminates. The loop runs for `n` iterations but can terminate early if `k` becomes 0. Let's break down the final state step-by-step.

### Key Observations:
1. **Loop Termination**: The loop terminates when `k` becomes 0 or when `i` reaches `n`.
2. **Variables Update**:
   - `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `b` and `s` are updated based on the values in `p`.
   - `bm` and `sm` are updated based on the maximum of their current value and a calculated expression.
   - `sp` and `bp` are incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.

### Final State Calculation:
- **`i`**: This will be `n-1` if the loop runs for all `n` iterations. If `k` becomes 0 before `i` reaches `n`, `i` will be the iteration number when `k` became 0.
- **`k`**: This will be `n - i - 1` if the loop runs for all `n` iterations. If `k` becomes 0, `k` will be 0.
- **`b` and `s`**: These will be updated `i` times based on the values in `p`.
- **`sp` and `bp`**: These will be incremented `i` times by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.
- **`sm` and `bm`**: These will be updated `i` times based on the maximum of their current value and a calculated expression.

### Final Output State:
Given the pattern of updates, the final state will be:

- `i` will be `min(n-1, initial_k - 1)` where `initial_k` is the initial value of `k`.
- `k` will be `max(0, initial_k - i - 1)`.
- `b` and `s` will be updated `i` times based on the values in `p`.
- `sp` will be `a[s] * (i + 1)`.
- `bp` will be `a[b] * (i + 1) - 1`.
- `sm` will be `sum(max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) for k in range(initial_k, initial_k - i - 1, -1))`.
- `bm` will be `sum(max(bm, a[b] * k + bp) for k in range(initial_k, initial_k - i - 1, -1))`.

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations, the loop will have run either `n` times or until `k` becomes 0, whichever comes first. The variable `i` will reflect the number of iterations completed. The variable `k` will be 0 if the loop terminated early due to `k` reaching 0, otherwise it will be `n - i - 1`. The variables `b` and `s` will have been updated accordingly based on the values in `p`. The variables `sp` and `bp` will be incremented by the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively for each iteration. The variables `sm` and `bm` will be updated based on the maximum of their current value and a calculated expression for each iteration.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `min(n-1, initial_k - 1)`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is `max(0, initial_k - i - 1)`, `b` is updated `i` times based on `p`, `s` is updated `i` times based on `p`, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s] * (i + 1)`, `bp` is `a[b] * (i + 1) - 1`, `sm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated expression for each iteration, `bm` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and a calculated expression for each iteration, `p` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.**
