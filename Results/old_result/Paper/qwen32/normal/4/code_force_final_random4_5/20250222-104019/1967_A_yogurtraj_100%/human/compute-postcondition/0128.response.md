Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is the same, `a` is the same sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `r` is `a[n - 1]`, and `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `k` is 0.**
