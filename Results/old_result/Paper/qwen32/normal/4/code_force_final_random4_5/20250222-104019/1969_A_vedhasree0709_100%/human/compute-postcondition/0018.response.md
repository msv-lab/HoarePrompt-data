Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element at index `i` in `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in `l`; `j` is set to 1; `i` must be less than `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `j` has been set to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions as described in the initial state.
