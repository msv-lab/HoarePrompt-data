You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

- Function Summary: 
The function reads input values representing test cases with specific constraints and performs checks to determine if certain conditions are met. If any of the conditions are not satisfied, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the result of a specific combinatorial product modulo `MOD`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to identify potential issues.

The code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. However, there are several cases and edge conditions that the code does not handle correctly:

1. **Handling of Prefix and Suffix Maximum Indices**:
   - The code checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index (`L[-1] != R[0]`). This is correct.
   - The code checks if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the first suffix maximum index is `N` (`L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N`). This is also correct.
   - The code checks if the second last prefix maximum index equals the second suffix maximum index when both `M1 > 1` and `M2 > 1` (`L[-2] == R[1]`). This check is not sufficient and may miss other invalid configurations.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The code calculates combinations using `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` to count the number of ways to arrange elements before the last prefix maximum index. This is correct.
   - The code then iterates through the prefix and suffix maximum indices to calculate the number of valid permutations. However, it does not correctly handle all cases where additional prefix or suffix maximums can be placed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where there are multiple prefix or suffix maximums in a way that ensures all possible valid permutations are counted.
   - The code does not handle cases where the prefix and suffix maximums overlap in a way that would reduce the number of valid permutations.

Here is a specific test case that the code fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5 3 3
1 2 5
2 3 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- The valid permutations are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.

**Actual Output from Provided Code:**
```
0
```

The code incorrectly returns `0` for this case because it does not correctly handle the overlap between prefix and suffix maximums.

Therefore, the provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
