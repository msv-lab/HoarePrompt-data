The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`. It prints an array `arr` of length `n` where elements are grouped into `cliques` (the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`), with each group of elements set to a unique integer value starting from 1. It also prints the number of cliques and an array `cliquess` of length `n` where each element is set to the number of cliques.
