The variable `k` is assigned the value of `j`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input, `k` is `j`, and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input, `k` is `j`, and `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`.**
