### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to analyze the logic used to determine the winner or if the game ends in a draw. Let's break down the logic step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the board dimensions `h` and `w` and the positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `x_a, y_a` and `x_b, y_b`.

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The program first checks if Alice's `x_a` is greater than Bob's `x_b`. If `x_a > x_b`, it means Alice is already in a row that is further down the board than Bob, and given the rules, Alice cannot catch up or move up, so the game ends in a draw.

3. **Distance Calculation**: If `x_a <= x_b`, the program calculates the vertical distance `x` between Alice and Bob's rows: `x = abs(a - c) // 2`. This value represents the maximum number of moves Alice can make towards Bob's row if both players play optimally.

4. **Odd Distance Handling**: If the vertical distance `abs(a - c)` is odd:
   - It calculates the range of columns Bob can occupy after `x` moves: `l = max(1, d - x)` and `r = min(w, d + x)`.
   - It then checks if Alice can move to any column within this range in her next move. If `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1`, it means Alice can catch Bob in her next move, and the program prints "Alice". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

5. **Even Distance Handling**: If the vertical distance `abs(a - c)` is even:
   - It calculates the range of columns Alice can occupy after `x` moves: `l = max(1, b - x)` and `r = min(w, b + x)`.
   - It then checks if Bob can move to any column within this range in his next move. If `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`, it means Bob can catch Alice in his next move, and the program prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Evaluation:

The logic in the program correctly handles the conditions for Alice and Bob to win or for the game to end in a draw based on the provided problem description. The program considers both odd and even distances between Alice and Bob and correctly evaluates the possible moves for both players.

### Conclusion:

The program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
