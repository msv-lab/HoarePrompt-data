Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value; `x` is a list containing the integer value of the first substring of `t` and the integer value of `xylist[0]`; `y` is a list containing the integer value of the second substring of `t` and the integer value of `xylist[1]`; `xylist` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string by spaces; `i` is 10.**

Explanation: The code snippet reassigns `xylist` to be a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string by spaces. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the new assignment to `xylist`.
