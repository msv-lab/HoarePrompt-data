The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes various variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) and their relationships, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is not dependent on the values of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`.
2. The string `'Yes'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. None of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) are referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
