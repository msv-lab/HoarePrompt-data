The code snippet `rem = k % (i + 1)` updates the value of `rem` based on the current value of `k` and `i`. Given that `i` is 3, the new value of `rem` will be `k % 4`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is `k % 4`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`. `i` is 3.**
