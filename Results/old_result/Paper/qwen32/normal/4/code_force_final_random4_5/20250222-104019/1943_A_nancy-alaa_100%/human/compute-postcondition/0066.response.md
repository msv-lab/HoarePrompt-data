Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `arr` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- `first` is a boolean set to True.
- `i` is an integer set to 2.

### The Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement is very straightforward. It prints the value of the variable `i`.

From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly set to 2. There are no operations or conditions provided in the snippet that change the value of `i`. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 2.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
