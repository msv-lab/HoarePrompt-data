Precondition: **The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid. The next n lines contain m characters each, which are either 'W' or 'B', representing the initial colors of the squares in the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
