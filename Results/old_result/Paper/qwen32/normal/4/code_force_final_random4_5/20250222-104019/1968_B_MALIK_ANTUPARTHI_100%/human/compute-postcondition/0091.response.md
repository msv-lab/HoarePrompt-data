The code snippet provided is simply a `break` statement, which will exit the most internal loop or if statement. None of the variables `j`, `k`, `i`, `b`, `c`, `d`, or `e` are modified by this statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1 from its last value, `b` is the first integer from the input, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the user's input, `e` is the user's input, and the loop or if statement is broken out of accordingly.**
