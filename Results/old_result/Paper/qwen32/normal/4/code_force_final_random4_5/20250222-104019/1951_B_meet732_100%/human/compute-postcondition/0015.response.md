Output State: **`a` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`), followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `x` is the value of `a[k]` for the current test case. `ind` is a list containing the value `i` if `a[i]` is greater than `x`, otherwise `ind` remains empty. If `a[i] > x`, then `ind` includes the value `i`. If `c` is 2, then the program executes the if part and `c` is increased by 1; otherwise, it does nothing. `i` is `j + 1`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `a`, `x`, `ind`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the program exits the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
