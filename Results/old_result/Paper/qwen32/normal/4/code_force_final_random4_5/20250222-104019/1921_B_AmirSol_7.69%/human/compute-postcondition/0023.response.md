To ensure the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that the condition `i < n` is satisfied. This means `i` must be less than `n`.

From the description, `i` can be updated to `n` or `n - 1` under certain conditions. To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is not equal to `n` and not equal to `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's analyze the conditions under which `i` could be less than `n - 1`:
- If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. However, `i` is not updated here.
- If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is updated to `n`. This means we need to avoid this condition.
- If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `i` is updated to `n - 1`. This means we need to avoid this condition as well.

To ensure `i` remains less than `n - 1`, we need to make sure that:
- `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` to avoid updating `i` to `n - 1`.
- `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]` or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]` to avoid updating `i` to `n`.

Given these conditions, we can set `i` to a value less than `n - 1` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for the current `i`, and `i` is less than `n - 1`**
