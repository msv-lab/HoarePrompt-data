The `IndexError` might occur at `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the index `-(negatives + i)` or `-i` is out of the bounds of the `elements` list. Specifically, if `negatives + i` is greater than the length of the `elements` list, accessing `elements[-(negatives + i)]` will raise an `IndexError`. Similarly, if `i` is greater than the length of the `elements` list, accessing `elements[-i]` will also raise an `IndexError`.

In this case, `i` is 5, so the `IndexError` could occur if `negatives + 5` or `5` exceeds the length of the `elements` list. If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is set to 0. Otherwise, `n` is updated by adding the difference between `elements[-(negatives + 5)]` and `elements[-5]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`removals` is at least 5, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing three elements `s - 2 * n`, `s`, and `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the previous sum of `elements` minus `elements[-4]` minus `elements[-5]`. If no `IndexError` occurs, `n` is the updated sum of the last `negatives` elements plus `2 * elements[-(negatives + 4)] - 2 * elements[-4]` plus `elements[-(negatives + 5)] - elements[-5]`. If an `IndexError` occurs, `n` is 0. `i` is 5.**
