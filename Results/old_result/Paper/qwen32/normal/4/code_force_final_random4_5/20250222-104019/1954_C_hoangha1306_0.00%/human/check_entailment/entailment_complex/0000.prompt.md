Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, x and y are integers represented as strings where 1 <= len(x) = len(y) <= 100, and each digit in x and y is between 1 and 9 (inclusive).

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` and `b` are strings provided by user input for each iteration; `kq1` is a string constructed based on the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] != b[i]` and `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`; `kq2` is a string constructed based on the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each index `i` where `a[i] != b[i]` and `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`; `vt` is 1 if there was at least one inequality between characters in `a` and `b` in the current iteration, otherwise 0; `q` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, reaching `t` after all iterations; the loop has executed `t` times, and for each execution, it prints `kq1` and `kq2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two strings `x` and `y` of equal length, where each character is a digit from 1 to 9. For each test case, it constructs two new strings: one where each digit is the maximum of the corresponding digits from `x` and `y` (with the first differing digit being the larger of the two), and another where each digit is the minimum of the corresponding digits from `x` and `y` (with the first differing digit being the smaller of the two). It then prints these two strings for each test case.
