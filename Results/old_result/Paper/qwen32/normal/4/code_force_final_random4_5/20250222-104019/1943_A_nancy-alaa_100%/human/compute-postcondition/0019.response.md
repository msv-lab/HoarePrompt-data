Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`. If `mpp[i]` is 1, then `first` is `True`. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged; `i` is `n` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
