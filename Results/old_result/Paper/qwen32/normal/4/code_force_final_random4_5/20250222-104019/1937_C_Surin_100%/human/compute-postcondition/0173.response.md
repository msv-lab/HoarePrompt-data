Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` (or 0 if no such input was received).
- `v2` is `n-1`.
- `prev` is 0.
- `kp` is `kp + 1` (This line doesn't affect the output of the print statement as `kp` is not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `v1` is defined as the largest value of `i` for which the user input was `'<'` or 0 if no such input was received.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
- `prev` is explicitly defined as 0.
- `v1` appears twice in the print statement, so it will be printed twice with the same value.

### Output:
Given that `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe the output in terms of the known values and the unknown value `i`.

Output: **? [v1] [i] [v1] 0 (where v1 is the largest value of i for which the user input was '<' or 0 if no such input was received, and i is an undefined variable)**
