Precondition: **There are multiple test cases, each containing a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. For each test case, the function can ask at most 3n queries in the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs (p_a, p_b) and (p_c, p_d). After determining the indices i and j that maximize p_i \oplus p_j, the function should output "! i j".**
