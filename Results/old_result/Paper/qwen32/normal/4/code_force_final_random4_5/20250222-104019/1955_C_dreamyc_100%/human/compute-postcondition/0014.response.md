The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9
- The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `k` is less than the sum of `nums`
- `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`
- `b` is `k // 2`
- If `s_a` (which is `nums[i]`) is less than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0
- `s_a` is `nums[i]`
- `s_b` is `nums[n - i - 1]`
- The current value of `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`

After executing `ans += 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n ≥ 1; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`; `ans` is incremented by 1; `s_a` is `nums[i]`; `s_b` is `nums[n - i - 1]`. The current value of `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`.**
