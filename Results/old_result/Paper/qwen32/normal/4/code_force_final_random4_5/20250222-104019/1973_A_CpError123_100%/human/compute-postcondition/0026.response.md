To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it affects the variables. The loop processes a series of inputs, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each input, it checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next iteration. If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` and `y` as `a + b`, then prints `min(x, y)`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop because they are not modified within the loop. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop until it reaches 0, at which point the loop terminates.

Since the problem specifies that the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd for the first three iterations, the loop will print `-1` for each of those iterations. After the third iteration, `t` will be decremented to 0 if it was initially 3, and the loop will terminate.

Therefore, the final state after all iterations of the loop have finished will be:

- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged from their initial values.
- `t` will be 0, indicating that all iterations have been completed.

Output State: **p_1, p_2, p_3 remain unchanged, t is 0.**

In natural language: The final output state is that the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` stay the same as they were initially, and the variable `t` becomes 0, indicating that all iterations of the loop have been executed.
