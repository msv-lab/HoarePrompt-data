The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are overwritten by the new input values.

The initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, and their sum is odd. After this line of code executes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the new integers provided by the input, and their sum will still be odd as per the precondition.

The other variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, `x`, and `y`) are not affected by this line of code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `c` is the third integer from the new input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is `(a + b + c) // 2`; `y` is `a + b`.**
