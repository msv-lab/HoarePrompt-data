The code calculates the integer square root of `n` and adds 1 to it, then assigns this result to the variable `root`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `ans` is still assigned the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers read from the input; `ans` is assigned the value of `n`; `root` is assigned the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**
