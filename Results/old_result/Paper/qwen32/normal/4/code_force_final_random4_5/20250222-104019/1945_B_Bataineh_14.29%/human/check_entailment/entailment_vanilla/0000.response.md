Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Two installations launch fireworks at different intervals (every `a` and `b` minutes), and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

### Program Analysis

The program provided is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if m < a or m < b:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads `t` number of test cases. For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`. If either condition is true, it prints `2`.

3. **Calculation**: If `m` is not less than `a` and `m` is not less than `b`, the program calculates the number of fireworks visible simultaneously using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints the result.

### Correctness Evaluation

Let's evaluate the correctness of the program based on the provided logic:

- **Condition Check (`m < a or m < b`)**:
  - If `m < a`, the first installation will not launch any fireworks within the first `m` minutes, and the second installation will launch only one firework within the first `m` minutes. Similarly, if `m < b`, the second installation will not launch any fireworks within the first `m` minutes, and the first installation will launch only one firework within the first `m` minutes. In both cases, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2` (one from each installation). This part of the logic seems correct.

- **Calculation (`m // a + m // b + 2`)**:
  - The logic here seems flawed. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks. The formula does not consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.
  - For example, if `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`, the correct answer is `2`, not `m // a + m // b + 2 = 4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2`, which is coincidentally correct but not due to the logic.
  - For another example, if `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `m = 10`, the correct answer is `7`, but the formula gives `10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7`, which again is coincidental and not due to the logic.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously for all cases. The formula used does not account for the overlap of visibility periods correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
