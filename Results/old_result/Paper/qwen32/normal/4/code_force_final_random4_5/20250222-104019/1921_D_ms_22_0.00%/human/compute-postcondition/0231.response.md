The code calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the tuple `item` and the element at index `tp1` in the list `b`. This new difference is stored in the variable `diff1`.

Output State: **`max_heap` contains at least one tuple in the form `(-diff, i, index)` after removing the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value, `t` is greater than 0 but has been decremented by `n`, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `item` is the tuple with the smallest `-diff` value that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`.**
