Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(1)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the conditions encountered in each of the `k` iterations, and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, no further changes occur. If `m` is 1, `m` remains 1. Otherwise, the `dp` array is fully populated from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` with each element calculated using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `m` remain unchanged as per the initial state except for the possible changes in `m` and the `dp` array when `m` is not 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is `t - 1`, `num` is the sum of `k` increments, each being either 1 or 2, `i` is `k - 1` if `m` is 1 or greater, otherwise `i` remains `k - 1`, `c` is the last first integer from the input, `r` is the last second integer from the input. If `m` equals 0, no additional modifications are made. If `m` is 1, `i` is set to `k - 1` and no further changes occur. If `m` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[i]` for `3 ≤ i ≤ m` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `t` is at least 0 and has been decremented by 1, `i` is either -1 or `m`, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s from each of the `k` iterations (i.e., `k + y` where `y` is the number of times `c != r`), and `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is equal to 0, no further changes occur. If `m` is equal to 1, `i` remains -1. If `m` is at least 3, `i` is set to `m`, and `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where the first element is 1, the second element is 3, and the rest are computed by the loop as `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7).`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
