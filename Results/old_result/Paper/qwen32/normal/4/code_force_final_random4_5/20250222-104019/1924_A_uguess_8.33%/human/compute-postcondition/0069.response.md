The code snippet provided increments the variable `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `cur_ss`, `cur`, and `ss`) are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` retains its value; The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` was not set before, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss); `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
