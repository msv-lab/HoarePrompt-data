The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `b`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` and `a` are integers obtained from the input with `a` ≥ 1; `d` and `e` are strings obtained from the input; `j` is 1. If `d[j]` is in the substring `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j + 1`. Otherwise, `k` remains 0 and the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`. In either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
