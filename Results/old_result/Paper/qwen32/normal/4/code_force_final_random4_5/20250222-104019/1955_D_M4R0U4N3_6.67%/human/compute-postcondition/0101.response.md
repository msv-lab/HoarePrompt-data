The code snippet `extra.remove(old)` removes the element `old` from the set `extra`. Given that `old` is in `extra`, after this operation, `extra` will no longer contain `old`.

Here is the updated state of the variables:
- `done` remains the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo` (unchanged).
- `todo` remains an empty set (unchanged).
- `extra` is now the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`, excluding `old`.
- `ans` remains 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0 (unchanged).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains less than `n` (unchanged).
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `old` remains `a[r - m]` (unchanged).

Output State: **`done` is the set of all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`; `todo` is an empty set; `extra` is the set of all elements from `a` that were not originally in `todo`, excluding `old`; `ans` is 1 if the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `n` remains unchanged; `m` is less than `n`; `k` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `old` is `a[r - m]`.**
