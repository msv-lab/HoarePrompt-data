The code snippet `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Given the initial state, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, and contains the value `x` if `a` is not 1 or 2. After executing `cx.add(x)`, `cx` will contain the value `x` regardless of the initial state of `cx`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is 1, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` remains 1000000007, `cx` contains the value `x`, `t` is at least 1 and `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is at least 2 and `n` is `n - 1`, `r` contains elements as per its initial condition or previous updates.**
