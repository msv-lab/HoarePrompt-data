Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed; `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed; `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`; `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed, excluding `old` if `old` was in `done`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is now included in `done` and excluded from `todo`. If `a[r]` was not in `todo`, it is now included in `extra`. `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed, including `old` if `old` was in `done`, and excluding `a[r]` if `a[r]` was in `todo`. `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, and `extra` does not include `old` if `old` was originally in `extra`, and includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. `ans` is 2 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. `m` must be less than `n`. `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is incremented by 1; `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` has `old` removed from it. Otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, `done` does not contain the value of `old` and `todo` contains the value of `old`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is `r + 1`; `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `old` was in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` was in `done`, it is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `done` or `todo`. If `a[r]` was in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `extra` contains `a[r]` and any other elements it had previously. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
