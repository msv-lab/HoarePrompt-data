Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly output the minimum and maximum values for each test case. Specifically, the `if` condition in the loop is incorrect. It should print the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value. However, the current code prints `x, y` when `x > y`, which is incorrect because it should be `y, x` in that case. Similarly, when `x <= y`, it should print `x, y`, but the code does the opposite. 

Here is the corrected version of the code for clarity:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

In the provided code, the condition `if x > y` is flawed because it prints the larger number first, which is not what the problem description requires. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
