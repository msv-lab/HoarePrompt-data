To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic and behavior using the provided problem description, program code, and annotations. We will also use the original assessment as a reference and validate it against the annotated code.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`. If true, it prints `-1`. This is correct because every game results in a total of 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1), so the total points must be even.

2. **Direct Draw Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score `p3` could have been achieved by the third player winning all games against the other two players, and the other two players could have drawn with each other `p1 + p2` times.
   - This part seems correct based on the problem constraints.

3. **Iterative Draw Calculation**:
   - If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `x` to 0 and `y` to `p3`.
   - The loop iterates while `y >= x`. Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3`.
   - The loop increments `x` and decrements `y` in each iteration.
   - If no valid `x` and `y` are found, it prints `p3`.

### Detailed Validation Using Annotated Code:

Let's validate the logic with the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
  - `(0 + 0 + 0) % 2 == 0` (even total points)
  - `0 < 0 + 0` (false)
  - `p3 < p1 + p2` (false)
  - Since `p3 >= p1 + p2` is true, it prints `0 + 0 = 0`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
  - `(0 + 1 + 1) % 2 == 0` (even total points)
  - `1 < 0 + 1` (true)
  - `p3 < p1 + p2` (true)
  - Loop: `x = 0`, `y = 1`
    - `0 - 0 <= 1 - 1` (true)
    - Prints `0 - 0 + 1 = 1`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
  - `(1 + 1 + 1) % 2 != 0` (odd total points)
  - Prints `-1`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
  - `(1 + 1 + 2) % 2 == 0` (even total points)
  - `2 < 1 + 1` (false)
  - `p3 >= p1 + p2` (true)
  - Prints `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
  - `(3 + 3 + 3) % 2 != 0` (odd total points)
  - Prints `-1`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
  - `(3 + 4 + 5) % 2 == 0` (even total points)
  - `5 < 3 + 4` (true)
  - `p3 < p1 + p2` (true)
  - Loop: `x = 0`, `y = 5`
    - `3 - 0 <= 4 - 5` (false)
    - Increment `x` and decrement `y` until `x = 2`, `y = 3`
    - `3 - 2 <= 4 - 3` (true)
    - Prints `3 - 2 + 5 = 6`.
  - **Correct**.

- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
  - `(1 + 1 + 10) % 2 != 0` (odd total points)
  - Prints `-1`.
  - **Correct**.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program's logic and comparing it with the expected outputs for the provided test cases, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. The annotated code and the original assessment align well with the expected behavior and outputs.
