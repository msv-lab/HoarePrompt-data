You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `X` and performs calculations to determine a sequence of integers related to the powers of 2 that sum up to `X`. It then prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap

We need to generate an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program should handle up to 1000 test cases, and for each test case, it should either provide a valid array or report that it is impossible to construct such an array.

### Program Analysis

1. **Handling Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X`.

2. **Special Case for `X = 2`:**
   - If `X` is 2, the program correctly outputs an array of length 1 with a single element, such as `[0]`. This array has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.

3. **General Case for `X > 2`:**
   - The program attempts to decompose `X` into a sum of powers of 2.
   - It initializes an empty list `subseq_lens` to store the lengths of subsequences.
   - It repeatedly finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `X` and subtracts it from `X`, appending the corresponding power (as an exponent) to `subseq_lens`.
   - The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum exponent found.

4. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` that starts with a sequence of integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - It then appends the exponents found in `subseq_lens` (excluding the first one) to `ansv`.
   - The constructed array `ansv` is then printed.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Construction of the Array:**
   - The program does not correctly construct an array that guarantees exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The logic for constructing the array does not align with the requirement to have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For example, the construction process does not ensure that the subsequences are strictly increasing or that the total number of subsequences is exactly `X`.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For example, if `X` is a very large number that cannot be decomposed into a valid array of length at most 200, the program should output `-1`.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Additionally, it fails to handle cases where it is impossible to construct such an array.
