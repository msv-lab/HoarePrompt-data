The code snippet `r = mid` changes the value of `r` to be equal to `mid`. Given that `mid` is initially `n // 2`, after executing this line, `r` will also hold the value `n // 2`. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be at least 2; `l` is 0; `r` is `n // 2`; `mid` is `n // 2`.**
