The code calculates `extra_space` by subtracting `remaining_cells` from `space_x`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `result`, `space_y`, `total_space`, `screen_require_for_y`, and `remaining_cells` remain unchanged. The new value of `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from input, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `n` is greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `space_x` is greater than `remaining_cells`.**
