The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The variables `t`, `i`, and their relationships to each other as described in the initial state remain unchanged because they are not involved in the given code snippet.

Given the initial state, the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are overwritten with new integer values read from the input. The values of `t` and `i` remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `t` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
