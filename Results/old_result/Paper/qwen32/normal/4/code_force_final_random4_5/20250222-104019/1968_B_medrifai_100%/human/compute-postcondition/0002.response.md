To determine the output state, let's break down the provided information:

- `a` and `b` are binary strings.
- `i` and `j` are non-negative integers with constraints 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b).
- The result of `b[j:].find(a[i])` is not -1, indicating that the substring starting at index `j` in `b` contains the character `a[i]`.

The code snippet is:
```
return j + index
```

Here, `index` is the result of `b[j:].find(a[i])`. Since `b[j:].find(a[i])` is not -1, `index` is a non-negative integer representing the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.

Thus, `j + index` gives the position of `a[i]` in the original string `b`.

Output State: **The program returns the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the string `b`, starting from index `j`.**
