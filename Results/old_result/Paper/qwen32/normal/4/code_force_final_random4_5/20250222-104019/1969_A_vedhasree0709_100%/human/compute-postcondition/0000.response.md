In the provided code snippet, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the function `int(input())`. Therefore, the only state we can adjust to ensure the loop executes is the value of `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that `1 <= t <= 5000`, it is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute at least once (since `t` is at least 1). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself to ensure the loop executes.

The variables `n` and `p` are defined inside the loop body and do not affect the execution of the loop itself. They are specific to each iteration and are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute, and no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000**
