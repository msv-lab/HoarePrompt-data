The code snippet provided sets the value of `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `cliquess[left + mid + 2]` is set to `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that `0 <= left < right < n` and `right - left >= 1`; `clique` is an integer representing the clique number; `small_element` is `left + 1`; `big_element` is `right + 1`; `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`; `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + i` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for `i` in `0` to `mid - 1`; `i` is 2; `arr[left + mid]` is `right + 1`; `cliquess[left + mid]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 1]` is `right`; `cliquess[left + mid + 1]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 2]` is `right - 1`; `cliquess[left + mid + 2]` is `clique`.**
