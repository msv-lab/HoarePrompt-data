The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `y` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`, `i` is 1, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`**.
