Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is 0, `r` is `a[3]`, and `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.**
