The code snippet `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Given the initial state, `st` originally contains the values `(n - 1) // 2` and `(n + 1) // 2`. After the code execution, `st` will include `mid` as well, assuming `mid` is not already one of the existing elements in `st`.

Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2` and `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `(n + 1) // 2`, we can conclude that `mid` is also `(n - 1) // 2` or `(n + 1) // 2` because the average of two consecutive integers is one of those integers. However, the specific value of `mid` is not provided, so we assume it could be either, but it will be added to the set `st`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2`, `(n + 1) // 2`, and `mid`, `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.
