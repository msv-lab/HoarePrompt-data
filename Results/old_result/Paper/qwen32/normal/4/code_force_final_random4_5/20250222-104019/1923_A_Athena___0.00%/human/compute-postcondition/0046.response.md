The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Initially, `a` is `[0]`, so after the `pop` operation, `a` will be an empty list `[]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 999, `n` is a newly input integer, `a` is `[]`, `res` is 0**.
