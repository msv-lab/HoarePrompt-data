The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `M`. This operation does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The only variable that changes is `L`, which is replaced by the newly created list `M`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is either 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `m` is either 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, `k` is either 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `M` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
