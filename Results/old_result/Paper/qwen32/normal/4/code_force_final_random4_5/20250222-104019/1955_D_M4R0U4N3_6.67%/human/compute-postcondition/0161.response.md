The code snippet `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. This means that if `a[j]` was not already in `extra`, it will now be included. The other variables (`done`, `todo`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is an empty set; `todo` contains unique integers from the input except `a[j]` if `a[j]` was in `todo`, otherwise `todo` remains unchanged; `extra` contains the element `a[j]` if `a[j]` was not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` remains an empty set; `ans` reflects the number of times `len(done) >= k`; `n` is the first input integer; `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is the third input integer; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `j` is `j + 1`; `extra` now contains `a[j]`**.
