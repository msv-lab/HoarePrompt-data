Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and `n` pairs of integers `(a, x)`. For each test case, the function evaluates the constraints: if `a` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`; if `a` is 2, `k` must be less than or equal to `x`; if `a` is 3, `k` must not be equal to `x`. The function returns a value indicating whether there exists an integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints for each test case.**
