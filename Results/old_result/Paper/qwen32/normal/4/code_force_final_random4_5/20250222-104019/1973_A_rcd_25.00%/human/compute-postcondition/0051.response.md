The only variable in the loop head is `cur`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur`. Specifically, the loop will continue to execute as long as `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `high` must be at least `cur` because of the condition `high >= cur`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cur` must be decremented by 1 (if it was incremented in the previous iteration) or adjusted such that `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur`.

Since the task is to modify the state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to ensure that `cur` is less than `high`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` and `high` must be at least `cur`. If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1. `cur` must be less than `high`**
