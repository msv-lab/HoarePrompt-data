Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to partition a string `s` into substrings, where each substring is not a palindrome. If such a partition exists, we need to print "YES" followed by the number of substrings and the substrings themselves. If no such partition exists, we print "NO".

### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - It reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It initializes `n` as the length of `s` and `x` as -1.
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[0:]) == False`), it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 1, and the string `s` itself as the partition.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first index `i` where `s[i]` is different from `s[0]`. This index is stored in `x`.
   - If no such index is found (`x == -1`), it means the entire string `s` consists of the same character and thus cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. It prints "NO".
   - If a valid index `x` is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `x` is `n // 2`. If either is true, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES", the number of partitions as 2, and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Issues in the Program
- The function `func_2` does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It only processes one test case per invocation.
- The logic for partitioning the string when `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome is incorrect. It does not guarantee a valid partition for all cases.
- The program does not handle the case where a valid partition is possible with more than 2 substrings.

### Correctness
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
