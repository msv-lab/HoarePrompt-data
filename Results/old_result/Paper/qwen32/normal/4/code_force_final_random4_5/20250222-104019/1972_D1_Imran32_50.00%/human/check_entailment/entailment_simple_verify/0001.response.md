### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program, the problem description, and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case in the `func_1()` function. However, the implementation in `func_1()` is not aligned with the problem requirements.

##### Key Points from the Program:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads `n` and `k` instead of `n` and `m`. This is indeed a typo and should be corrected to read `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n` and then iterates from `i = 2` to `root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `cnt = i * i` and updates `ans` by adding `(n + i) // cnt`.
   - The final `ans` is printed.

##### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that `n` and `k` are read from the input.
- The variable `ans` is initialized to `n` and updated in the loop as described.
- The final output is `ans`.

##### Comparison with Problem Requirements:
- The program does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Instead, it appears to be calculating some unrelated quantity involving divisors and square roots.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. It incorrectly calculates a different quantity that is not related to the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
