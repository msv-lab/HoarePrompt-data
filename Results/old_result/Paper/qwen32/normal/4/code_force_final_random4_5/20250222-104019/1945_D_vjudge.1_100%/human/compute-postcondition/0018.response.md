Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in lists `a` and `b`), `k` (an integer such that 1 <= k <= n), and two lists `a` and `b` (each containing `n` integers where each integer in `a` and `b` is between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
