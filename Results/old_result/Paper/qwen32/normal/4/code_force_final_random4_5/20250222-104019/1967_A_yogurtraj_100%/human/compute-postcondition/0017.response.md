Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`, then `k` is set to 0, `r` is updated to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.**
