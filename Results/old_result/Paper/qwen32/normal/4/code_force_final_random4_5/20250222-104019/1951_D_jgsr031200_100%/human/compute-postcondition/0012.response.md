To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects present in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over the `costs` list. Therefore, we need to ensure that the `costs` list is in a state that allows the loop to execute at least once.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in costs:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the `costs` list has at least one element. The current state of `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, which means it already contains two elements. Therefore, the loop will execute without any changes to the `costs` list.

However, since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head only involves the `costs` list, we need to ensure that `costs` is correctly defined as a list with at least one element. Given the current state, `costs` already meets this requirement.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}. n is not equal to k, and n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing the values `[n - k + 1, 1]`. `h` is 0.**

Since the `costs` list already contains elements, no further adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes. The loop will iterate over the two elements in the `costs` list.
