The code appends the element at index `i` of list `a` to list `l`. The other variables (`dp`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of `a` and the first `j` elements of `b`; `i` is at least 1; `j` is at least 1; `l` is a list that now contains the element `a[i]` appended to it.**
