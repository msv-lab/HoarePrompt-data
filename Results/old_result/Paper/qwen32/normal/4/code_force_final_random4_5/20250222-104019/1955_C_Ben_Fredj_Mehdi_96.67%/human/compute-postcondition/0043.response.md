The `print('0')` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or conditions described in the initial state. The string `'0'` is directly passed to the `print` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('0')`, which means it will output the string `'0'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `n`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'0'`.

Output: **0**
