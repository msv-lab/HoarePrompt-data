Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `input` is the function `sys.stdin.read`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `idx` is 2; `t` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1, making `idx` equal to 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
