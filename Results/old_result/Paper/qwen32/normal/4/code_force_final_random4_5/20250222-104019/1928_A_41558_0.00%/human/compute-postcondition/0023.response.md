The given initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `i`, but none of these variables are directly used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. However, it is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Variables `a` and `b`**: These are integers read from the input, but they are not used in the `print` statement.
3. **Variable `n`**: It is greater than 0, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
4. **Variable `i`**: It is defined as `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. However, `i` is not used in the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, or `i`, the output will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
