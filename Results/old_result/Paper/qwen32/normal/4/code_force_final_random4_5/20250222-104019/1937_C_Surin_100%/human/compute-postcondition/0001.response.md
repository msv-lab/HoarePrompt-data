The code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it. The initial state includes the definition of the function `I` and other preconditions related to test cases, permutations, and queries, which remain unchanged.

Impact of the code:
- A new variable `R` is introduced, which is a lambda function that reads an integer from the input.

Output State: **The function `I` is defined to read a line of input, split it by spaces, convert each element to an integer, and return the list of integers. The lambda function `R` is defined to read a line of input, convert it to an integer, and return it. The initial state regarding test cases, permutations, and queries remains unchanged.**
