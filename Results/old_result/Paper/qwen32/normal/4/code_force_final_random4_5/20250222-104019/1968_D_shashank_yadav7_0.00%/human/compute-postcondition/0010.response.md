The code snippet assigns the value of `a[s] * k` to the variable `sm`. Given that `sp` is already defined as `a[s]`, we can express `sm` as `sp * k`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, `s-1` are integers obtained from the input, `b` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `bp * k`, `sm` is `sp * k`.**
