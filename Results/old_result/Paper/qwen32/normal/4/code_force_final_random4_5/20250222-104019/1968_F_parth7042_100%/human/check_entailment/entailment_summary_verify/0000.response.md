### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to ensure its correctness based on the given function summary and problem description.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.
- The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array and several queries. For each query, it checks if the subarray can be split as required.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function calculates prefix XOR values for the array.
- It uses a map (`mp`) to store indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
- For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray using prefix XOR values.
- If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it is trivially "interesting".
- Otherwise, it checks if there are indices in the map that allow the subarray to be split into parts with equal XOR values.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array.
   - This is done using the formula: `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.

2. **Map of Prefix XOR Values**:
   - The map `mp` is correctly populated with indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - This is done using `mp[pf[i]].append(i)`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - **Trivial Case**: If the XOR of the subarray (`x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`) is `0`, the subarray can be trivially divided into parts with equal XOR values.
   - **Non-trivial Case**: The logic to check for the existence of indices in the map is:
     ```python
     v1 = mp[pf[r]]
     v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
     it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
     it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
     if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]):
         results.append('YES')
     else:
         results.append('NO')
     ```
     This logic is intended to find indices in `v1` and `v2` such that there exists a valid split. The condition `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that there is a valid split between these indices.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The code should handle edge cases such as:
  - Subarrays of length `2` where the two elements are the same.
  - Subarrays where the XOR of all elements is `0`.
  - Subarrays where no valid split exists.

#### Testing the Code:
Let's test the code with a few edge cases to ensure it handles them correctly:

#### Test Case 1:
```
1
3 1
1 1 1
1 3
```
**Expected Output**: `YES` (since `1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1` and can be split as `[1], [1, 1]` or `[1, 1], [1]`)

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 2
1 4
```
**Expected Output**: `YES` (since `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 2 = 0` and can be split trivially)

#### Test Case 3:
```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4
1 4
```
**Expected Output**: `NO` (since `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 4` and no valid split exists)

#### Test Case 4:
```
1
6 1
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 6
```
**Expected Output**: `NO` (since `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 7` and no valid split exists)

### Conclusion:
After testing the code with various edge cases and understanding its logic, it appears that the program correctly identifies whether a subarray can be divided into `k > 1` parts with equal XOR values.

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic for the non-trivial case. The condition `v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that there is a valid split between these indices, but it does not guarantee that the XOR of each part is equal. The current logic only checks for the existence of indices, not the equality of XOR values for each part.

To correctly determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values, we need to ensure that the XOR of each part is indeed equal. This requires a more sophisticated approach, such as checking the frequency of each prefix XOR value within the subarray and ensuring that the XOR of each part is consistent.

Given the current implementation, it does not fully meet the problem's requirements for non-trivial cases.

**Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR values and maintains a map of these values. However, the logic for checking the existence of valid splits does not ensure that the XOR of each part is equal, which is a requirement of the problem.

Final: **False**
