The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (2 ≤ `t` ≤ number of test cases); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a non-empty string; `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace; `i` is now `i + 1` and is still less than the length of `a`; `work` is a boolean variable; `ans` includes the character `b[i]` appended to it.
