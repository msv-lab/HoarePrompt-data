The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but the print statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the specific values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, or `cur`. The print statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will output the string 'NO' regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **NO**
