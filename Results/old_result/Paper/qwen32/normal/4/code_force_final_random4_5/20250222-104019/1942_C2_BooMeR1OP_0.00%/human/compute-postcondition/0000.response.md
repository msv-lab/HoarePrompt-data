Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the integer values from the input, where `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

In simpler terms: The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now set to the integers provided in the input. The constraints on these variables remain the same as described in the initial state.
