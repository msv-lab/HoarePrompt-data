The code snippet updates the `nums` list by reading a new set of integers from the input. The other variables (`start_year`, `num_tests`, `n`, `x`) remain unchanged. 

Given that `nums` is reassigned, its new value will be a list of integers obtained from the input. The length of this new list will determine the new value of `x`, which is `len(nums) - 1`.

Output State: **`start_year` is the result of the last iteration's formula, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.**
