Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; `x` is 0; `y` is equal to `p3`. Additionally, `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
