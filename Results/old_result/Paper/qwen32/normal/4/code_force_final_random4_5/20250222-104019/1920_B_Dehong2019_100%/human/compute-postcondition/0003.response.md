The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. Given that `t` was an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, this value remains unaffected by the new assignments.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from the input.**
