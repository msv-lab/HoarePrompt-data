Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is 3, `r` is `a[3]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 4`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
