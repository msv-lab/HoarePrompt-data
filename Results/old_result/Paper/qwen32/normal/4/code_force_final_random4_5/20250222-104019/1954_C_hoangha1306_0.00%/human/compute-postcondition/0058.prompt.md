Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is the string provided by the user input; `b` is the string provided by the next user input; `kq1` is an empty string; `kq2` is an empty string; `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input. If the character at index `i` in `a` is equal to the character at index `i` in `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the character at index `i` of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` if `vt` was 0, otherwise it is the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the string representation of `y` if `vt` was 0, otherwise it is the string representation of `x`, and `vt` is set to 1 if it was 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is updated to 1, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]` or `y` otherwise, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]` or `x` otherwise. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a` is a string with at least 1 character, `b` is the string provided by the next user input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with the character at the new index `i` of string `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values at index `i` of `a` and `b`. If `vt` was 0, `vt` is now 1. `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` and `kq2` with the string representation of `y` if `a[i] > b[i]`; otherwise, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` with the string representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
