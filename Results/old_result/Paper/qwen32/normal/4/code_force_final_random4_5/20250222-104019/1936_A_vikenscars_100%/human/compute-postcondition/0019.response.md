Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is the largest index `i` in the range 1 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', or 0 if `func_1` never returns '<'; `pair_idx` is 0, `i` is 0, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, and `ans1` is equal to '<'**

In this output state, the value of `pair_idx` has been updated to 0, as per the provided code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values.
