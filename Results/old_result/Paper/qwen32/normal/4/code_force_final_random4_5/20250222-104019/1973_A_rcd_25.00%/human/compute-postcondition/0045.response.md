Postcondition: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, the value of `cur` remains `low`. Otherwise, `cur` is updated to `low + 1` and `p1 - (low + 1)` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - (low + 1))`.**
