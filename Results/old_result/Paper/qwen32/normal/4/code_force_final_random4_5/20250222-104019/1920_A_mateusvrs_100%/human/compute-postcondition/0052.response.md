Output State: **`bx` and `ax` are integers. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `r` has a new element appended, which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input, but the values of `bx`, `ax`, `r`, `tmp`, and `t` remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.
