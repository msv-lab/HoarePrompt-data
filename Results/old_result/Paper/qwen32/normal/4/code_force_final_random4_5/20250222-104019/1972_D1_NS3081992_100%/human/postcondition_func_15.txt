The function `func_16` executes a loop a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. In each iteration, it calls `func_15()` and prints the result. The function itself does not accept any parameters directly from the user and does not return a value explicitly. It outputs the results of `func_15()` to the standard output.
