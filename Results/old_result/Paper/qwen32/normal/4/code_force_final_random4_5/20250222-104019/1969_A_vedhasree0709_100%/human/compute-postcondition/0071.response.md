The value of `i` is explicitly set to `0` by the code. The values of `j`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged as per the initial state description. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is either 0 or 1. If `j == 0`, then `i` is equal to `n`. If `j == 1`, then `i` is the index where the condition `q == i + 1` was met during the iterations. `t` and `n` remain unchanged. `l` is now a new list of integers read from the input.**
