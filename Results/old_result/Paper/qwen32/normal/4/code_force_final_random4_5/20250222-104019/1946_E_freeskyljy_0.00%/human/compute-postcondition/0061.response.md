Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `p_1, p_2, ..., p_{M1}`, `s_1, s_2, ..., s_{M2}`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged; `nums_left` is -4; `M2` is greater than 1; `i` is incremented by 1 such that `i + 1 < N`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, then `cur` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (-3) % MOD`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `nums_left` has been decremented by 1, changing its value from -3 to -4. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
