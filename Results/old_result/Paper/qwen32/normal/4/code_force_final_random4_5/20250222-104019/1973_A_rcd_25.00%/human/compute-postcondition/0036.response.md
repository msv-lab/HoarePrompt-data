Let's analyze the given task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - The condition `if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` is always true due to the precondition.
   - The behavior described in the if part is the only outcome, but it does not affect the values of `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(p1 + p2)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `p1 + p2`.
   - However, based on the structure of the problem, we know that `p1 + p2` is a specific sum of the two integers.

4. **Output**:
   The `print` statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers read from the input)**
