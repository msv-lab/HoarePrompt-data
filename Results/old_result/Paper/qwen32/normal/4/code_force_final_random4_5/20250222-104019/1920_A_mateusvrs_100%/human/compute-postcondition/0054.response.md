Output State: **`bx` and `ax` are integers. `ax` is 1000000007. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` has an additional element `0` appended to it. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), and `r` has a new element appended, which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. `t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `cx` is an empty set.**

In simple terms: The value of `ax` has been updated to 1000000007. All other variables and conditions remain as they were initially described.
