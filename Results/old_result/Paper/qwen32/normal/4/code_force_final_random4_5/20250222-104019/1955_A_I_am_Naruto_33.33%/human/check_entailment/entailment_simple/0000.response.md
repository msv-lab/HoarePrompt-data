### Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts `n`, the regular price `a`, and the promotional price `b`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price: `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is the cost if yogurts are bought in pairs as much as possible at the promotional price and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price: `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
     - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - If `n` is 1, the cost is simply the regular price `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the program using the provided example:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Minimum cost: `9`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost: `14`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost: `15`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost: `20`

The program produces the correct output for all test cases provided in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts given the prices `a` and `b`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts by considering both the regular price and the promotional price for two yogurts, and it handles all edge cases as demonstrated by the example.
Correctness: **True**
