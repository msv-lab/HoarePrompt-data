Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum `x` encountered when `a == 1`, `ax` is the minimum `x` encountered when `a == 2`, and `cx` is a set of all `x` encountered when `a == 3`. `t` is `t - n`, `n` is 0, and `r` remains unchanged except that if `bx > ax`, `0` is appended to `r`; otherwise, a new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is appended to `r`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that satisfy `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`.**
