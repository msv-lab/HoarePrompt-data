Let's break down the given information and the code step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. **t**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (This is the number of test cases, but it doesn't affect the current calculation as we are focusing on a single test case).
2. **n, a, b**: Integers read from the input.
3. **a and b**: If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, they remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`.
4. **k**: Calculated as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
5. **ans**: Calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`.
6. **p2**: Calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

### Calculation of k:
- `k = min(b - a + 1, n)`

### Calculation of ans:
- `ans = int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`

### Calculation of p2:
- `p2 = (n - k) * a`

### Final Output:
- The final output will be `ans + p2`.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Determine k**:
   - `k` is the smaller value between `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `b - a + 1` represents the number of integers from `a` to `b` inclusive.
   - If `n` is smaller than `b - a + 1`, then `k` will be `n`.

2. **Calculate ans**:
   - `ans` is calculated using the formula `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`.
   - This formula is used to compute the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 until `b - k + 1`.

3. **Calculate p2**:
   - `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - This represents the sum of `a` repeated `(n - k)` times.

4. **Sum ans and p2**:
   - The final output is the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

### Output:
Based on the given initial state and the calculations described, the output of the print statement will be the sum of `ans` and `p2`.

Output: **ans + p2 (where ans is int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k) and p2 is (n - k) * a, with k being min(b - a + 1, n))**
