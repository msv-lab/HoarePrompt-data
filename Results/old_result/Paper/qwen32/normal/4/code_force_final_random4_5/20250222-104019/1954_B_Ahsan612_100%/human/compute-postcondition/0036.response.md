The `print(-1)` statement in the provided code snippet will output the value `-1` regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, `num`, `same`, and `minn`. These variables are described in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of the `print(-1)` statement.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers.
- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
- `num` is the last unique number in `ar`.
- `same` is the count of the last sequence of identical numbers.
- `minn` is the minimum of its current value and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is either equal to infinity or equal to the length of `ar`.

None of these variables are used in the `print(-1)` statement. The statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
