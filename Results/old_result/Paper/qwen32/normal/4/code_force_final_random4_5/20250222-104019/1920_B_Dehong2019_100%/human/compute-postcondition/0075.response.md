The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The value of `ans1` is updated, but the other variables (`k`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Since `k` must be greater than 0 as per the initial state, this condition still holds true after the code execution.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `ans1` is incremented by `a[i]`; `a` and `i` are unchanged.**
