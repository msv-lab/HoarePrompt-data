Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of an n x n binary grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, which are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one shape, which is either a triangle or a square, and the shape consists of more than one '1'. The function returns "triangle" if the shape in the grid is a triangle, and "square" if the shape in the grid is a square.**
