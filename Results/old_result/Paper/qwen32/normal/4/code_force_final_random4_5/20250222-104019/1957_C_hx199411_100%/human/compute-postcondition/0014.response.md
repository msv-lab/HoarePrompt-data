The code snippet `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given that `num` is either 1 or 2 based on a previous condition, after this operation, `num` will be either 2 or 3.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `c` and `r` are integers read from input, `num` is either 2 or 3, `i` is incremented by 1 if `c` does not equal `r`.**
