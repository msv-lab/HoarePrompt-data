Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input. If `n` > 1, then `ans1` is equal to `a * n` and `ans2` is equal to `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`. Otherwise, `n` is equal to 1 and the values of `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

This postcondition summarizes the overall effect of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts and maintaining the relationships between the variables as described in the precondition.
