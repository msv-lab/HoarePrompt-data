The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1, `res` is incremented by 1**.
