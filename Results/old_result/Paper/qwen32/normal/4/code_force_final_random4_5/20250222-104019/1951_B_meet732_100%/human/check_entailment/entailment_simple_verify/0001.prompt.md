You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
We need to determine the maximum number of wins the cow at position `k` can achieve in a tournament where cows are ranked based on their Cowdeforces ratings. The cow can either do nothing or swap places with another cow once. The tournament is a series of matches where the winner of each match proceeds to the next match against the next cow in line.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (index of the cow we are interested in, 1-based).
   - It reads the list of ratings `a` for the cows.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The index `k` is adjusted to be 0-based (`k -= 1`).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the maximum number of wins for the cow at index `k`.
   - It initializes `x` with the rating of the cow at index `k`.
   - It iterates over the list of ratings to find the indices of the first two cows with ratings higher than `x` and stores these indices in the list `ind`.
   - It breaks the loop once it finds two such cows.

4. **Win Calculation Logic:**
   - If no cow has a higher rating than `x`, the cow at `k` can win all matches (`return n - 1`).
   - If only one cow has a higher rating:
     - If this cow is at index 0, the cow at `k` can win all matches up to its own position (`return k - 1`).
     - If this cow is at an index greater than `k`, the cow at `k` can win up to the position of this cow minus one (`return ind[0] - 1`).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the maximum wins considering the position of the higher-rated cow (`return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)`).
   - If two cows have higher ratings:
     - If the first higher-rated cow is at index 0, the cow at `k` can win up to the second higher-rated cow minus one (`return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)`).
     - If the cow at `k` is positioned after the second higher-rated cow, the cow at `k` can win up to the position of the first higher-rated cow or the second higher-rated cow minus the first (`return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])`).
     - Otherwise, it calculates the maximum wins considering the position of the first higher-rated cow (`return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])`).

### Issues in the Program

Let's consider the second test case provided in the problem statement:
```
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
```
- The cow at index 5 (1-based) has a rating of 12.
- The ratings are: [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13].
- The first cow with a higher rating is at index 2 (rating 727).
- The second cow with a higher rating is at index 5 (rating 13).

The program will find these two indices, but the logic to calculate the maximum wins is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for all possible scenarios where swapping could increase the number of wins for the cow at `k`.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the logic, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
