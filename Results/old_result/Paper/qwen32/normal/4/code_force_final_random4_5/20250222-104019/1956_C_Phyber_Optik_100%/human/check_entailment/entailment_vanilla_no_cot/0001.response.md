### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using a limited number of operations.
   - Two types of operations are allowed: 
     - Type 1: Assign a row to a permutation.
     - Type 2: Assign a column to a permutation.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix and ensure no more than \( 2n \) operations are used.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the matrix size, \( n \).
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix using the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2
     \]
     This formula is derived from the observation that the maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with distinct integers from 1 to \( n^2 \) in a way that each row and column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

3. **Verification of the Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum of the first \( n \) squares is given by the formula:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
     \]
   - However, the provided program calculates the sum in a different manner:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i
     \]
     This can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - (i-1)^2 \cdot i = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i-1)i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2
     \]
     This matches the correct formula for the sum of the first \( n \) squares.

4. **Verification of the Operations:**
   - The program outputs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.
   - The operations involve filling each row and column with the permutation \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum sum.
   - It performs the required operations to achieve this sum within the allowed limit.
