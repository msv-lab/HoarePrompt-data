To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the for loop statement:

```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `(1, n)` is non-empty. The range function `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to, but not including, `n`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

Let's examine the variables in the loop head:
- `i` is the loop variable.
- `n` is the upper bound of the range (exclusive).

The variables `g`, `v1`, `prev`, and `kp` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to make the loop execute. The state of `n` is the only variable that can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given that `n` is the integer input by the user, the state of `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is unchanged**
