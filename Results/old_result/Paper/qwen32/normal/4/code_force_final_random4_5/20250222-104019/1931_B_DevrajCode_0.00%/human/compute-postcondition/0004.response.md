The code calculates the `target` by dividing `total_water` by `n`. Since `total_water` is the sum of the list `a` and is divisible by `n`, the `target` will be an integer. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of the list `a`, and `total_water % n` equals 0; `target` is `total_water // n`.**
