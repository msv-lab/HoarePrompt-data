The code snippet provided assigns a new value to the variable `tmp`. Specifically, `tmp` is updated to be the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `tmp`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`, `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is the character 'a' + `i`, and `ans` is a string consisting of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The output state is the same as the initial state except that `tmp` is now the character 'a' plus the current value of `i`. All other variables retain their initial values.
