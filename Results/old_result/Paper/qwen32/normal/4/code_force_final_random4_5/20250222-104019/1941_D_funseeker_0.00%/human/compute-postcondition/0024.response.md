Output State: **`n` and `m` are greater than 0; `x` is the value returned by `func_3()`; `ans` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` based on the value of `c`; `r` is an integer; `temp` is a set containing all values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` based on the value of `c`.**

In simpler terms: The variable `ans` is now updated to be the same as `temp`, which contains all the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` set. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `temp`) remain unchanged.
