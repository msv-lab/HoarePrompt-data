The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Let's break down the given state and the loop:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, and the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`.
- The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 1` to proceed to the next element in the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans` is `x - 2`
- `gaps` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` is greater than 0, otherwise `gaps` remains an empty list
- `x` is greater than 0
- `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)`
- `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`

Since only `i` can be adjusted, we increment `i` by 1 to start the next iteration.

State: **`ans` is `x - 2`, `gaps` is a list containing `[gap]` if `gap` is greater than 0, otherwise `gaps` remains an empty list, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`**
