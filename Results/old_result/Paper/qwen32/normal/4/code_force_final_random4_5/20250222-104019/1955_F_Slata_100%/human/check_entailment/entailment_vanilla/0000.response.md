To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to understand the rules of the game and how Eve can optimally remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

### Game Analysis
1. **Winning Condition**: Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero. Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
2. **XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of two identical numbers is zero.
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.
3. **Numbers and Their XOR**:
   - 1 XOR 1 = 0
   - 2 XOR 2 = 0
   - 3 XOR 3 = 0
   - 4 XOR 4 = 0
   - 1 XOR 2 = 3
   - 1 XOR 3 = 2
   - 1 XOR 4 = 5 (which is 1 in 4-bit representation)
   - 2 XOR 3 = 1
   - 2 XOR 4 = 6 (which is 2 in 4-bit representation)
   - 3 XOR 4 = 7 (which is 3 in 4-bit representation)
4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**: Eve should aim to leave sequences with an even count of each number (except possibly one odd count) to maximize Bob's wins.

### Strategy Breakdown
- If the count of a number is even, it can be paired up to produce zeros.
- If the count of a number is odd, one number will remain unpaired.
- The XOR of the sequence will be zero if:
  - All counts are even.
  - All counts are even except one is odd.

### Program Analysis
The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
1. Counting the number of pairs for each number (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`).
2. Checking if there are exactly three odd counts (`a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`). If so, it adds one more to the count of Bob's wins.

This logic is based on the idea that:
- Each pair contributes to Bob's win.
- If there are exactly three odd counts, the XOR will be zero because the remaining unpaired numbers will cancel out in a way that leaves the XOR as zero.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the given examples:

1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (add 1)
   - Output: `1`

2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 0 + 1 = 2` (do not add 1)
   - Output: `1`

3. **Input**: `2 2 2 0`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (do not add 1)
   - Output: `3`

4. **Input**: `3 3 2 0`
   - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
   - Odd counts: `1 + 1 + 0 = 2` (do not add 1)
   - Output: `3`

5. **Input**: `0 9 9 9`
   - Pairs: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
   - Odd counts: `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (add 1)
   - Output: `12`

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Correctness: **True**
