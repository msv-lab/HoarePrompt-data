To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition `r - l > 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation.
- `n` is the length of `array`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n`.

The loop condition is `r - l > 1`. To ensure this condition is true for the first iteration, we need to make sure that `r - l` is greater than 1.

Currently, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`. For the condition `r - l > 1` to be true, `n` must be at least 2. If `n` is 1, then `r - l` would be 1, and the loop would not execute.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that needs to be found in the permutation; `n` is the length of `array` and `n` must be at least 2; `l` is 0; `r` is `n`.**
