Given the provided code snippet and initial state, the only variable that is modified is `c1`. The code increments `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Since the initial value of `c1` is `0`, after executing the code, `c1` will be equal to `coef1[j]`.

Here is the Output State:

Output State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000; `x` is a list where each `x[i]` is the first integer from the i-th input; `y` is a list where each `y[i]` is the second integer from the i-th input; `r` is a list where each `r[i]` is the third integer from the i-th input; `visited` is a list of `False` values with `visited[1]` which is `True` and possibly `visited[0]` which is `True` if it was initially `False`; `coef0` is a list of `None` values with `coef0[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef0[0]` which is `0` if it was initially `False`; `coef1` is a list of `None` values with `coef1[1]` which may have been updated and possibly `coef1[0]` which is `1` if it was initially `False`; `nodes` is a list which must have at least one element; `i` is 1; `ok` is `False` unless `visited[0]` was initially `False` and `dfs(i)` modifies it; `c0` is `0` plus `coef0[j]`; `c1` is `coef1[j]`.**
