The code snippet `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` performs a binary search on the list `v1` to find the insertion point for `l` such that all elements before `it1` in `v1` are less than `l`, and all elements at and after `it1` are greater than or equal to `l`. This does not change the values of any existing variables but introduces a new variable `it1` with the result of this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integer values of `data[3]` to `data[n + 2]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 5`; `results` is `['YES']` if `x` is 0, otherwise `results` remains an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR up to that point; `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the insertion point in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order.**
