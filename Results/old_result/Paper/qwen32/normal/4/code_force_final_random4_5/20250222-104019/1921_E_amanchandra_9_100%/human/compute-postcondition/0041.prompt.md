Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are as initially described
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if a > c:
        print('Draw')
    else:
        x = abs(a - c) // 2
        if abs(a - c) % 2:
            l = max(1, d - x)
            r = min(w, d + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <=
                x + 1])
        else:
            l = max(1, b - x)
            r = min(w, b + x)
            print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` are as initially described; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the integers from the input. If `a` is greater than `c`, no changes are made to `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `x`, `l`. Otherwise, `r` is `min(w, d + (c - a) // 2)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `r` is `min(w, b + (c - a) // 2)`. `a` is less than or equal to `c`. `x` is `(c - a) // 2`. `l` is `max(1, d - x)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `l` is `max(1, b - (c - a) // 2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer that was initially greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1. `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as initially described. If `a > c`, then `r`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the integers from the input and no additional changes are made to `r`. Otherwise, `r` is `min(w, d + x)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `r` is `min(w, b + x)`. `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`. `l` is `max(1, d - x)` if `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, otherwise `l` is `max(1, b - x)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer that is greater than 0, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` remain as initially described, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are the integers from the input. If `a > c`, the state of the variables remains as initially described. Otherwise, `x` is `abs(a - c) // 2`. If `abs(a - c) % 2` is true, then `r` is `min(w, d + x)` and `l` is `max(1, d - x)`. Otherwise, `r` is `min(w, b + x)` and `l` is `max(1, b - x)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
