Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to achieve the maximum final score by always pairing the smallest available numbers. Here's why the program works as intended:

1. **Sorting the List**: The program first sorts the list of numbers. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together first, maximizing the sum of the minimums in each pair.

2. **Summing the Even Indices**: After sorting, the program sums the numbers at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This works because, after sorting, the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list, and by summing every second number starting from the first (index 0), we are effectively summing the minimums of the pairs.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n`, reads the list of `2n` integers, sorts the list, and then prints the sum of the minimums of the pairs.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, it handles all potential cases correctly. The program sorts the numbers and sums the minimums of the pairs, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score. There are no edge cases that the program does not handle, such as when all numbers are the same, when there are duplicate numbers, or when the numbers are in random order. The program will always output the correct maximum score for any valid input within the problem's constraints.
