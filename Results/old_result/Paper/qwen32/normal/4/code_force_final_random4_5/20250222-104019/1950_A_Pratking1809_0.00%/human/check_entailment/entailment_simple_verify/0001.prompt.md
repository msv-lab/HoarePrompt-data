You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input from the last iteration, `q` is an integer representing the total number of iterations that have occurred, `i` is equal to `q - 1` (since `i` will be `q-1` after the loop has completed all `q` iterations), and `mn` is 100. No changes are made to `t`, `mn`, or any other variables outside of the loop body. The loop has finished executing all `q` iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three digits (a, b, and c). It correctly identifies whether the digits form a "STAIR" (a < b < c), a "PEAK" (a < b > c), or neither ("NONE"). Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers (a, b, and c).
4. It checks if a < b < c and prints "STAIR" if true.
5. It checks if a < b > c and prints "PEAK" if true.
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The logic correctly covers all possible scenarios for the three digits:
- If a < b < c, it prints "STAIR".
- If a < b > c, it prints "PEAK".
- In all other cases, it prints "NONE".

The program does not contain any errors that would cause incorrect output for valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
