To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the provided initial state:

- `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the queue `q`.
- `graph` is a dictionary or adjacency list representing the graph, but it is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- `vis` is a list or dictionary used to keep track of visited vertices where `vis[node]` is 1 if the node has been visited and 0 otherwise.
- `q` has had its front element removed, meaning `ver` is no longer in `q`.
- `vis[ver]` is 1, indicating that `ver` has been visited.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(ver, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `ver` followed by a space, without a newline at the end. Since `ver` is the vertex that was at the front of the queue `q`, and it has been visited (`vis[ver]` is 1), the output will simply be the value of `ver`.

Given the initial state, we don't have the explicit value of `ver`, but we know it is a vertex in the graph that has been visited and removed from the queue.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `ver`, which is a vertex in the graph.

Output: **ver (where ver is the vertex that was at the front of the queue q and has been visited)**
