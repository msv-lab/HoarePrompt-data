The code snippet `b[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `b` by 1. This directly affects the value of `b[x]`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is unchanged.
- `i` is the next element in `s` after the current value of `i`.
- `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.
- `r` is increased by `a[x]`.

The only variable that changes due to the execution of the code is `b[x]`, which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`s` is unchanged, `i` is the next element in `s` after the current value of `i`, `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`, `r` is increased by `a[x]`, `b[x]` is incremented by 1.**
