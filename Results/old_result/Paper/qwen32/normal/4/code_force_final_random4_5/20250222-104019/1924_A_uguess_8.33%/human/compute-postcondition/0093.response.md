To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The value of `i` needs to be incremented for the next iteration, and `k` remains unchanged.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence.
- `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence.
- `i` is 1.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `ans` is a string of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
- If the `i`-th bit of `cur` was not set, `tmp` is 'b'. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 'a'.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented. Therefore, `i` becomes 2. The variable `k` remains the same as it defines the range of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cnt` is the number of times `k` unique characters were encountered in sequence; `cur` is 0 if the last sequence did not complete a set of `k` unique characters, otherwise it is the bitmask of the last incomplete sequence; `i` is 2; `cnt` is less than `n`; `ans` is a string of `cnt` occurrences of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`**.
