The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then prints a specific sequence of numbers related to `n`. The function prints a calculated value based on `n` followed by a series of lines for each `i` from 1 to `n`, each containing two sequences of numbers.
