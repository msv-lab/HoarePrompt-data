### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotated version and the problem description.

1. **Total Points Calculation**:
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If the sum is odd, it outputs `-1` because an odd total number of points cannot be achieved with the given scoring system (each game awards exactly 2 points, either to the winner or split between two players in a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible number of draws as `(a + b + c) // 2`, which is correct because each draw awards 2 points.
   - It then compares this value with `a + b` (the sum of the two lower scores). This comparison ensures that the maximum number of draws does not exceed the sum of the two lower scores, as each draw involves two players and the highest score `c` cannot be solely achieved through draws.

3. **Constraints on Player Scores**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and verifies the feasibility of the scores with the given conditions. For example, if `a + b < (a + b + c) // 2`, it means that the highest score `c` cannot be achieved solely through draws, and thus the maximum number of draws is constrained by `a + b`.

4. **Verification with Example Inputs**:
   - The program correctly handles all the provided example inputs and produces the expected outputs.
   - The annotated version confirms that the program's state remains consistent with the problem's requirements throughout the execution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and test cases. The original assessment is accurate, and the program behaves as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
