Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`. If `r2` is `'<'`, then `prev` is set to the largest integer `i` for which the user's response was `'<'` and `r` remains `'='`. Otherwise, `prev` remains 0 and `r` remains `'='`.**
