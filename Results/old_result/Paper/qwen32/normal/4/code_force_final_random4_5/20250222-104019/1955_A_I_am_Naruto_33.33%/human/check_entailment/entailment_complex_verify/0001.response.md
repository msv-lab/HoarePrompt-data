### Reasoning:
Let's systematically evaluate the program using the problem description, the provided code, the initial assessment, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Determine the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts, where the price for one yogurt is `a` burles and the price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
- **Conditions**:
  - If `n = 1`, the cost is simply `a`.
  - If `n > 1`, consider:
    - **Scenario 1**: Buy all yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
    - **Scenario 2**: Buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`b * (n // 2)`) and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price (`a * (n % 2)`).
    - The final cost is the minimum of these two scenarios.

#### Program Code Recap:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
```

#### Annotations Recap:
- The program processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- If `n > 1`, it computes two costs:
  - `ans1`: Regular price for `n` yogurts (`a * n`).
  - `ans2`: Promotion price for as many pairs as possible plus the cost for any remaining yogurt (`b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`).
- It prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- If `n = 1`, it directly prints `a`.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case (2 yogurts, a=5, b=9)**:
   - Regular price: `2 * 5 = 10`
   - Promotion price: `9` (1 pair)
   - Minimum: `9`
   - **Program Output**: `9` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case (3 yogurts, a=5, b=9)**:
   - Regular price: `3 * 5 = 15`
   - Promotion price: `9 + 5 = 14` (1 pair + 1 single)
   - Minimum: `14`
   - **Program Output**: `14` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case (3 yogurts, a=5, b=11)**:
   - Regular price: `3 * 5 = 15`
   - Promotion price: `11 + 5 = 16` (1 pair + 1 single)
   - Minimum: `15`
   - **Program Output**: `15` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case (4 yogurts, a=5, b=11)**:
   - Regular price: `4 * 5 = 20`
   - Promotion price: `11 * 2 = 22` (2 pairs)
   - Minimum: `20`
   - **Program Output**: `20` (Correct)

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum cost for all the provided test cases. The logic implemented in the program matches the problem requirements and the annotations accurately describe the program's behavior.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
