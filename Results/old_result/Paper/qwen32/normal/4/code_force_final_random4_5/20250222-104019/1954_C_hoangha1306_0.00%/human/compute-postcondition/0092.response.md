Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, let's determine the output state.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input
- `b` is a new string provided by the user input
- `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1
- `i` is 1

Code Snippet:
```python
x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
```

The code snippet assigns the minimum and maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b` to variables `x` and `y` respectively.

Since `i` is 1, the characters at index 1 of `a` and `b` are considered. Let's denote these characters as `a[1]` and `b[1]`. The values of `x` and `y` will be the minimum and maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `a` remains the non-empty string provided by the user input
- `b` remains the new string provided by the user input
- `q` remains the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1
- `i` remains 1
- `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`
- `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is a non-empty string provided by the user input; `b` is a new string provided by the user input; `q` is the value of `q` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `i` is 1; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`.**
