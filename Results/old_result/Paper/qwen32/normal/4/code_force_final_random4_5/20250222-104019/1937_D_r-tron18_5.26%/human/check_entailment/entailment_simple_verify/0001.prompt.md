You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a grid of cells containing '<' or '>', and it calculates the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.

Let's break down the program step by step:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program does not explicitly show the input reading part, but it assumes that the input is structured as described in the problem statement.
   - It processes each test case independently.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates a difference between two accumulated values based on the `times` parameter.
   - It is used to compute indices for certain calculations in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It uses prefix and suffix accumulations to efficiently compute the required values.
   - It handles two cases for each cell based on whether the cell contains '>' or '<'.
   - For each cell, it calculates the time to leave the grid and stores it in the `ans` list.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program initializes prefix sums for '>' characters and suffix sums for '<' characters.
   - It iterates over the grid from right to left, updating the prefix and suffix sums as it processes each cell.
   - It uses the `func_1` function to compute the time for the pinball to leave the grid based on the current state and accumulated sums.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

**Analysis:**
- The program uses a sophisticated approach with prefix and suffix sums to efficiently compute the required times.
- However, the implementation is complex and relies heavily on the correctness of the `func_1` function and the logic within `func_2`.
- The program does not include explicit checks or debugging statements, which makes it challenging to verify correctness without running extensive tests.

**Testing:**
- The example provided in the problem statement is used to test the program.
- The output of the program matches the expected output for the given example, which suggests that the program is likely correct for this specific case.
- However, the complexity of the program and the lack of additional test cases make it difficult to conclusively determine correctness without further analysis or testing.

**Conclusion:**
While the program appears to work for the provided example, its correctness for all possible inputs is not guaranteed without further validation. Given the complexity and the lack of additional test cases, it is reasonable to assume that the program is intended to be correct based on the problem statement and the example provided.

Correctness: **True**

However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on the assumption that the program is intended to be correct and that the example provided is representative of all possible cases. Further testing and validation would be necessary to ensure absolute correctness.
