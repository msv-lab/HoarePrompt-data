To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which is `high` and `cur` in this case. The loop condition is `while high >= cur`, so we need to ensure that after the previous iteration, `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur` to allow the loop to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` remains unchanged.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- If `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` holds true, `cur` remains equal to `low`.
- Otherwise, `cur` is set to `low + 1` and `p1 - cur` is greater than `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
- If the condition is not met and there is an else part, `cur` is incremented by 1.

Let's analyze the condition `high >= cur`:
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` can be either `low` or `low + 1` after the previous iteration, or it can be `cur + 1` if the condition was not met and there is an else part.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`. Since `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` can be `low`, `low + 1`, or `cur + 1`, we need to ensure that `high` is at least `cur + 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `high` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input; the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `p3` remains unchanged; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`**
