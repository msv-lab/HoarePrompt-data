The value of `r` is updated to be equal to `mid`. Given that `mid` is initially `n // 2`, the new value of `r` will be `n // 2`. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, `l`, and `mid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`**.
