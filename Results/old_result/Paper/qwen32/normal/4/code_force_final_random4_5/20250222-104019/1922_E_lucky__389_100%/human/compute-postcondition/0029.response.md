Output State: **`t` (number of test cases) is equal to `x` and `x` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**

In simple terms, the number of test cases `t` remains the same and is equal to `x`, which is at least 2. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The list `subseq_lens` remains unchanged and is still empty.
