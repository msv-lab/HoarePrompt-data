### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated version to ensure that the logic is correct for all cases.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading two integers, `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is correctly calculated as `x * 1` (which is just `x`).
   - `space_y` is correctly calculated as `y * 4` (since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells).

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2 + 1`.
   - This logic is correct because each 2x2 icon requires a 2x2 block, and thus every pair of 2x2 icons can fit on one screen, but if there's an odd number of 2x2 icons, an additional screen is needed.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This is the correct calculation because `15 * screen_require_for_y` gives the total number of cells in the screens allocated for 2x2 icons, and `space_y` is the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.

5. **Extra Screen Calculation**:
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means that the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, and thus the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the extra screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`).
   - It then calculates `extra_screen` as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space` is not divisible by 15, or `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space` is divisible by 15.
   - Finally, it adds `extra_screen` to `screen_require_for_y` to get the total number of screens required.

### Testing with Edge Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided edge cases and an additional few to ensure correctness:

1. **Case 1**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 0`
   - `remaining_cells = 0`
   - `result = 0`
   - Correct.

2. **Case 2**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`
   - `result = 1`
   - Correct.

3. **Case 3**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`
   - `result = 1`
   - Correct.

4. **Case 4**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 2`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 16 = 14`
   - `result = 2`
   - Correct.

5. **Case 5**: `x = 0`, `y = 3`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 2`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 12 = 18`
   - `result = 2`
   - Correct.

6. **Case 6**: `x = 15`, `y = 0`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 0`
   - `remaining_cells = 0`
   - `result = 1`
   - Correct.

7. **Case 7**: `x = 0`, `y = 9`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 5`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 5 - 36 = 39`
   - `result = 5`
   - Correct.

8. **Case 8**: `x = 8`, `y = 2`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`
   - `result = 2`
   - Correct.

9. **Case 9**: `x = 14`, `y = 2`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 8 = 7`
   - `extra_space = 14 - 7 = 7`
   - `extra_screen = 7 // 15 + 1 = 1`
   - `result = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - Correct.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program and verifying it with multiple edge cases, it appears that the logic is correct for all scenarios. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

Final: **True**.
