Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while i < n:
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
            counter += 1
            i += 2
        else:
            counter += 1
            i += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is 1 and `i` is updated according to the specified rules: if `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 2; otherwise, `i` is set to 1. Additionally, either `i` is equal to `n - 1`, or `s1[i + 1]` is equal to `s2[i + 1]`, or `s1[i]` is equal to `s1[i + 1]`. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` remains 0 and `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is updated to `n`. Otherwise, `i` is updated to `n - 1`. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `i` is updated to `n - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` for the current `i`. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, `counter` is incremented by 1. If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 or remains less than `n - 1`. If `s1[i]` equals `s2[i]`, `i` is less than `n - 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
