You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: `t` iterations of the loop have completed, and for each iteration, the program determines whether the string `s` contains at least `n` sequences of all `k` distinct characters in any order. If it does, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string `ans` that consists of the `k`-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, the character `tmp` (the highest-indexed character not yet encountered in the last incomplete sequence), and 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` sequences of all `k` distinct characters in any order. If it does, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' followed by a constructed string `ans` that consists of the `k`-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, the highest-indexed character not yet encountered in the last incomplete sequence, and 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the string `s`. If not, we need to provide an example of a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the program and see if it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Counting Subsequences:**
   - The program uses a bitmask `cur` to track which of the first `k` alphabets have been seen in the current sequence.
   - When a new character is encountered, it updates the bitmask.
   - If the bitmask `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` alphabets have been seen in the current sequence, and it increments the count `cnt` and resets `cur`.
   - This logic aims to count how many times a sequence containing all `k` alphabets appears in `s`.

3. **Checking Subsequence Count:**
   - If `cnt` is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and tries to construct a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Constructing a Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program constructs a string `ans` by appending the `k`-th alphabet `cnt` times.
   - It then appends the first missing alphabet from the current bitmask `cur`.
   - Finally, it appends 'a' until the length of `ans` is `n`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Counting Subsequences:**
   - The logic for counting subsequences is flawed. It only counts sequences where all `k` alphabets appear consecutively without considering subsequences that can have gaps.
   - This does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

2. **Constructing a Missing Subsequence:**
   - The construction of the missing subsequence is also incorrect. It does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
