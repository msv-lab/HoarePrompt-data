Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program reads the input, sorts the array, and prints the sorted array. However, the task is to calculate and print the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order, and then the beauty can be calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This program sorts the array, calculates the beauty as described, and prints the result for each test case.
