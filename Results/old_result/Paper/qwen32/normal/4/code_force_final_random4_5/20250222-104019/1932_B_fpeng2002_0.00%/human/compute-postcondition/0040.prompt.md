Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start_year` is the value computed after processing all elements in the `nums` list according to the given formula, `num_tests` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers, and `x` is the last index of the `nums` list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: start_year is the result of the last iteration's formula, num_tests is a positive integer less than its previous value, n is an input integer, nums is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and x is len(nums) - 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start_year` is the result of `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]` after all iterations, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
