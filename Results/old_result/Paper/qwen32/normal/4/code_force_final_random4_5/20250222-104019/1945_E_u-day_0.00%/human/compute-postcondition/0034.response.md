Given the initial state and the code snippet, the variable `low` is updated to the value of `mid`. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `(n - 1) // 2`, `(n + 1) // 2`, and `mid`, `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `high` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

In simpler terms, the value of `low` has been updated to the value of `mid`, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
