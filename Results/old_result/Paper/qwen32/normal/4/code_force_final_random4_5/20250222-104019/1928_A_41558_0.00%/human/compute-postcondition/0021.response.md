The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `i`, and `k`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('NO')`.
2. The string `'NO'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on any variables.
3. None of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `i`, or `k` are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
