The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be increased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration to prepare for the next iteration.

The variables `j`, `m`, and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted according to the task constraints.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1** (which means if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should now be `x + 1` to start the next iteration of the loop)
