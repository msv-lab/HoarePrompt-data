The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `mid`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mid`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `mid`. However, since `i` is currently equal to `mid`, the loop will not execute again.

But, if we consider the state just before the last iteration, `i` would be `mid - 1`. So, to adjust the state for the next iteration (which would be the last iteration), `i` should be `mid - 1`.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that 0 <= left < right < n and right - left >= 1, `clique` is an integer representing the clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) // 2`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `left + 1 + (right - left + 1) // 2`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is `mid - 1`**
