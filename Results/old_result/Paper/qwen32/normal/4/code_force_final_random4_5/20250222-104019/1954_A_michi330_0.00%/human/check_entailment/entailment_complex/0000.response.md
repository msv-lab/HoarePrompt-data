### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Objective:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Fail:**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is "NO".
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, Bob can still make all parts the same color by repainting the remaining parts after Alice's initial painting, so the answer is "NO".
   - Otherwise, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the answer is "YES".

3. **Explanation of the Condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`:**
   - `n / m` represents the average number of parts per color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible.
   - `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to this average, which is the maximum number of parts that can be the same color if Alice distributes the colors in the most balanced way.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` represents the minimum number of parts that must be different colors if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible.
   - If this number is less than `k`, Bob can repaint these different parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is "NO".

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program checks these conditions correctly and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions described.
