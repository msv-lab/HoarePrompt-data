The code snippet assigns the value of `j` to `k`. Given that `j` is 0, `k` will also be 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the value of the first integer from the user input and must be greater than 0, `c` is the value of the second integer from the user input, `d` is the value of the string input by the user, `e` is the value of the user input, `j` is 0, `k` is 0**.
