### Reasoning:

The goal is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix using no more than 2n operations. Each operation can either fill a row or a column with a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n.

The program provided generates a matrix where each row is filled with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n], and then it calculates the sum of the matrix. The sum is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This formula seems to be derived from the fact that each number `k` from 1 to `n` appears in the matrix in a specific pattern, and the sum of these occurrences is computed.

The program then outputs the calculated sum and the number of operations, which is `2n`. It also outputs the operations themselves, which consist of filling each row and then each column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

Let's verify if this approach is correct:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is used to calculate the sum of the matrix. This formula is correct because each number `k` from 1 to `n` appears in the matrix in a specific pattern. Specifically, the number `k` appears `k` times in the rows and `k` times in the columns, but the exact count of occurrences of each number in the matrix is captured by this formula.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program outputs `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit. Each operation either fills a row or a column with the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]. This ensures that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 1`, the matrix is filled with [1], and the sum is 1. The program outputs `1 1` and `1 1 1`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2`, the matrix is filled with [[1, 2], [1, 2]], and the sum is 7. The program outputs `7 3`, `1 1 1 2`, `1 2 1 2`, and `2 1 1 2`, which is correct.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness: **True**
