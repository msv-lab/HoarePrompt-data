### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, where `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3`.
- If the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games, we should print `-1`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2` is not zero. If it is not zero, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even.

2. **Max Draws Calculation**:
   - If `p3 ≥ p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2` because the maximum number of draws can be the sum of the lower two scores.
   - Otherwise, it uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws that satisfy the conditions.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes up to 500 test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order.
- It calculates and prints the maximum possible number of draws that can be achieved under the given constraints, or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Sum of Scores Check**:
   - This check is correct. If the total points are odd, it is impossible to have a valid set of games because each game awards an even number of points.

2. **Max Draws Calculation**:
   - **Case 1**: `p3 ≥ p1 + p2`
     - This condition is correct. If `p3` is at least the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the maximum number of draws can be `p1 + p2` because the remaining points can be distributed as wins without violating the score constraints.
   - **Case 2**: `p3 < p1 + p2`
     - The while loop is intended to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` to find a valid configuration where `p1 - x ≤ p2 - y`. This ensures that the remaining points can be distributed as wins without violating the score constraints.
     - The loop condition `y >= x` and the logic inside the loop are designed to find the maximum number of draws that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
     - No games were played, so no draws could have happened. The program outputs `0`, which is correct.
   - **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
     - One game ended in a draw. The program outputs `1`, which is correct.
   - **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
     - Impossible to achieve with valid games. The program outputs `-1`, which is correct.
   - **Example 4**: `1 1 2`
     - One game with a win and one with a draw. The program outputs `2`, which is correct.
   - **Example 5**: `3 3 3`
     - Impossible to achieve with valid games. The program outputs `-1`, which is correct.
   - **Example 6**: `3 4 5`
     - Possible with six draws. The program outputs `6`, which is correct.
   - **Example 7**: `1 1 10`
     - Possible with two draws and several wins. The program outputs `2`, which is correct.
   - **Additional Edge Cases**:
     - `0 0 1`: Impossible to achieve with valid games. The program outputs `-1`, which is correct.
     - `0 2 2`: Possible with two draws. The program outputs `2`, which is correct.
     - `2 2 4`: Possible with four draws. The program outputs `4`, which is correct.
     - `1 2 4`: Impossible to achieve with valid games. The program outputs `-1`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
After carefully analyzing the code and testing it with various examples and edge cases, it is clear that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws or identifies inconsistent scores in all tested cases.

**Final: True**
