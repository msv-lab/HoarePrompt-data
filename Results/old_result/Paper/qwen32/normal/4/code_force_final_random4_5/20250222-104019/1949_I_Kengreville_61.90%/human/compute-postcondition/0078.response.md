The given initial state provides several details about the variables and their values or states. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, `i`, or `ok`. The `print` statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This means that regardless of the values or states of the other variables, the string 'NO' will be printed.

Output: **NO**
