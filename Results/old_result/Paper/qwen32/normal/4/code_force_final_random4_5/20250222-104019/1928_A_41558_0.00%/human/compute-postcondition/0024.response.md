Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `k + 2` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, the condition is met; otherwise, the condition is not met. In both cases, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and the relationship for `i` remain unchanged.**
