The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('199999')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'199999'`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `z` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement is printing a hardcoded string.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `z` is incremented by 1 (`z = z + 1`).

None of these variables are used in the print statement. Therefore, the output will always be the string `'199999'`.

Output: **199999**
