The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it computes and prints a value based on the relationship between `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, and adds this to the product of `(n - k)` and `a`.
