The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `v`) and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string `'-1'` specified in the `print` statement.

Output: **-1**
