Output State: **`todo` does not include `a[r]`, `done` includes all elements from `a` that were originally in `todo`, except `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. Additionally, `a[r]` is now in `done`. `extra` includes `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, `todo` includes `old`. If `old` is in `done` and in `extra`, `old` is removed from both `done` and `extra`; otherwise, if `old` is in `done`, it is removed from `done` and `todo` includes `old`. `n` remains unchanged, `m` is less than `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `old` is `a[2]`. `r` is `m + 2`. If the number of elements in `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 2.**

In simpler terms, `a[r]` has been added to `done`. The other conditions and variables remain as described in the initial state.
