Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integer values of `data[3]` to `data[n + 2]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 3`; `results` is an empty list; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR up to that point.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integer values of `data[3]` to `data[n + 2]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 5`; `results` is `['YES', 'YES']` if `x` was initially 0 and `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise `results` is `['YES', 'NO']` if `x` is 0, and `['NO']` if `x` is not 0; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR up to that point; `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[n + 4]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the insertion point in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the insertion point in `v2` where `r` would fit to maintain sorted order, minus 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integer values of `data[3]` to `data[n + 2]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 7`; `results` is `['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']` if `x` was initially 0 and `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise `results` is `['YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'YES']` if `x` is 0, and `['NO', 'YES']` if `x` is not 0 and `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise `results` is `['NO', 'NO']` if `x` is not 0; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR up to that point; `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the insertion point in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the largest index in `v2` where the value is less than `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `q` is the integer value of `data[2]` minus 2 and must be greater than or equal to 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[0]` is 0 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the integer values of `data[3]` to `data[n + 2]`; `data` is unchanged; `index` is `n + 9`; `results` is `['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']` if `x` is initially 0 and `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, `['YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']` if `x` is 0 and not all conditions are met, `['NO', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']` if `x` is not 0 and `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, `['NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']` if `x` is not 0 and not all conditions are met, `['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'NO']` if `x` is initially 0 and the conditions are not met, `['YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'NO']` if `x` is 0 and not all conditions are met, `['NO', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'NO']` if `x` is not 0 and the conditions are not met, `['NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO']` if `x` is not 0 and not all conditions are met; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[0]` is 0 and `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` are the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`; `mp` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and `mp[0]` is `[0]`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list of indices `i` where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR up to that point; `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the insertion point in `v1` where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order; `it2` is the largest index in `v2` where the value is less than `r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
