The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state mentions that `max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` are final pointers in `b`, `ans` is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances, and `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1. None of these variables are affected by the given code snippet. The only changes are the introduction of `n` and `m` with the values read from the input.

Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `tp1` and `tp2` are final pointers in `b`, `ans` is the total accumulated sum of the maximum distances, `t` is greater than 0 but decreased by 1, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.**
