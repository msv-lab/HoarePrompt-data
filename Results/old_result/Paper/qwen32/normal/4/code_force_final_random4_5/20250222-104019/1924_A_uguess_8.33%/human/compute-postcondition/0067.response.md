The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the variable `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`, where `1 << cur_ss` represents a bitwise shift operation. This operation sets the bit at the position `cur_ss` to 1 in the binary representation of `1`, effectively creating a binary number with only the `cur_ss`-th bit set to 1.

Given the initial state, `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). Therefore, the operation `1 << cur_ss` will create a number where only the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is set to 1.

After executing `cur += 1 << cur_ss`, the value of `cur` will have its bit at position `cur_ss` set to 1, while the other bits remain unchanged.

Here is the output state with the updated value of `cur`:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty string; `i` is incremented by 1; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); If `cur` is equal to (1 << k) - 1, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `cur` retains its value; The bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is set to 1; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`**
