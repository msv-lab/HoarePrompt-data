You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 500 test cases, each consisting of three integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the conditions provided: if the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1; otherwise, it calculates and prints the maximum possible score that can be achieved under the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to closely examine its logic in relation to the problem description and the given examples.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Total Points Check**: The program first checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is correct because every game results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1). Therefore, the total points across all games must be even.

2. **Direct Draw Calculation**:
   - If `(p3 >= p1 + p2)`, it prints `(p1 + p2)`. This is based on the idea that if the highest score (`p3`) is at least the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws would be `(p1 + p2)`. This is because the other two players could have drawn with each other `(p1 + p2)` times, and the third player could have won all games against them.
   - This part seems correct based on the problem constraints.

3. **Iterative Draw Calculation**:
   - If the above condition is not met, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
   - It then iterates while `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Inside the loop, it checks if `(p1 - x) <= (p2 - y)`. If this condition is met, it prints `(p1 - x + p3)`.
   - The loop increments `x` and decrements `y` in each iteration.
   - If no valid `x` and `y` are found, it prints `p3`.

### Analysis of Specific Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0` -> No games played, so no draws. Correct output: `0`.
- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1` -> One draw between the second and third players. Correct output: `1`.
- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1` -> Not possible to achieve these scores. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2` -> Two draws possible between the first and second players, and the third player wins one game against one of them. Correct output: `2`.
- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3` -> Not possible to achieve these scores. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5` -> Six draws possible among the players. Correct output: `6`.
- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10` -> Not possible to achieve these scores. Correct output: `-1`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program's logic and comparing it with the expected outputs for the provided test cases, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem.
