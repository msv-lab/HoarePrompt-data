Output State: **`a[r]` is in `todo`. `done` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` and processed, excluding `old` if `old` was in `done`, and now also includes `a[r]`. `todo` contains elements from `a` that were in `todo` but not processed, including `old` if `old` was in `done`, excluding `a[r]`. `extra` contains elements from `a` that were not in `todo`, and `extra` does not include `old` if `old` was originally in `extra`. `ans` is 1 if `len(done) >= k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. `m` must be less than `n`. `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value `a[r]` has been added to the `done` set, meaning it is now considered processed. The `todo` set no longer contains `a[r]` since it has been moved to `done`. The `extra` set remains unchanged. The value of `ans` is recalculated to be 1 if the number of elements in `done` is now greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it remains 0. The values of `m`, `n`, and `old` are unchanged.
