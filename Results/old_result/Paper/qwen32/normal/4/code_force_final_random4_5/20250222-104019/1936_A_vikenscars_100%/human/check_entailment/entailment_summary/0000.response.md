### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to find two indices `i` and `j` in a permutation `p` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized, using at most `3n` queries. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs a query string in the format `? a b c d` and sends it as output.
   - It then reads the response from the input, which is the result of the comparison between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`.
   - The function returns this response.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function determines the maximum value in the permutation `p` by iteratively comparing each element with the current maximum (`max_item_idx`).
   - It uses `func_1` to compare pairs of elements to find the maximum element.
   - After finding the maximum element, it looks for a pair `(max_item_idx, pair_idx)` such that `p_max_item_idx ⊕ p_pair_idx` is maximized.
   - It again uses `func_1` to compare pairs of elements to find the best pair.

The logic in `func_2` is as follows:
- First, it finds the index of the maximum element in the permutation `p` by comparing each element with the current maximum.
- Then, it tries to find another element that, when XORed with the maximum element, gives the highest possible value. It does this by comparing pairs of elements and using the results to update the candidate for the second element in the pair.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_2` uses a strategy to find the maximum element and then the best pair efficiently.
- The number of queries made by `func_2` is within the allowed `3n` limit:
  - Finding the maximum element requires `n-1` queries.
  - Finding the best pair involves at most `2(n-1)` queries.
  - Thus, the total number of queries is `3n-3`, which is less than `3n`.

- The logic for finding the maximum and the best pair is sound and should correctly identify a pair of indices that maximizes the XOR operation.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct as it adheres to the problem description and efficiently finds the required indices using the allowed number of queries.

**Correctness: True**
