Precondition: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix a for that test case. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5.**
