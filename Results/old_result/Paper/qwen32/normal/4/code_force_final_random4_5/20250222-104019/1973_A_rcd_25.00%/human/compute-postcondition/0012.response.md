To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `high >= cur` holds true. The variables `high` and `cur` are the only ones directly involved in the loop condition.

Given:
- `cur` is initialized to `low`.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

For the loop to execute, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur` (which is `low`). This means `high` must be greater than or equal to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:
1. If `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` have different signs (one positive and one negative), then `high` will be the positive value and `low` will be the negative value. In this case, `high >= cur` will be true because `cur` is the negative value and `high` is the positive value.
2. If both `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are non-negative, then `high` and `cur` will both be non-negative, and `high >= cur` will be true by definition.
3. If both `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are non-positive, then `high` and `cur` will both be non-positive, and `high >= cur` will be true by definition.

Given that `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the differences `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` can be either positive, negative, or zero, but the condition `high >= cur` will always be satisfied because `high` is the maximum of these two differences and `cur` is the minimum.

Therefore, no adjustment is required for the loop to execute at least once. The conditions provided already ensure that `high >= cur`.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. `cur` is equal to `low`.**
