You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`. It then prints "YES" if `b` is equal to `c`, "NO" if `b` is less than `c`, and "Yes" if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). Otherwise, it prints "No".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
Let's analyze the provided code and see if it handles all the potential cases as described in the problem statement.

The problem states that in each move, Nikita can either add one cube or remove one cube. Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes `m` on the tower must satisfy the condition that the difference `|n - m|` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and an even number of such changes is required to go from 0 to `m` if `m` is different from `n`.

Here's the provided code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Let's break down the conditions:
1. `if b == c:`: This handles the case where the number of moves equals the number of cubes, which is correct.
2. `elif b < c:`: This handles the case where the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, which is incorrect. Nikita cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves.
3. `elif b % 2 == c % 2:`: This condition checks if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves and the number of cubes is the same. This is correct because the difference `|n - m|` must be even.
4. `else:`: This handles all other cases, which is correct.

However, the condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect because it should not print 'NO' in all cases. Instead, it should check if the parity condition is satisfied. Let's consider a counterexample:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
4 2
```
Expected Output:
```
YES
```
Explanation:
Nikita can perform the following sequence of moves: add, add, remove, remove. This results in a tower with 2 cubes after 4 moves.

However, the provided code will output "NO" for this input because `b < c` is not true, and it will not check the parity condition.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
