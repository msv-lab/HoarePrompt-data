Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`). The function returns a list containing two strings. The first string is the value of `l + 1`, and the second string is the value of the index of `find` in the array plus one.**
