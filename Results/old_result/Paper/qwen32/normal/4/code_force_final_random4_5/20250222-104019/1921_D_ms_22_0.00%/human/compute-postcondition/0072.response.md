Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 99, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `max_heap` is a heap of tuples `(-diff, i, j)` with at least one tuple remaining, `item` is assigned the value of the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated by `diff1`.**

Natural language: The value of `ans` has been increased by `diff1`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The `max_heap` still contains at least one tuple, and `item` holds the tuple that was removed. The values of `diff1` and `diff2` are calculated based on the elements of `b` and the second element of `item`. The variable `tp1` has been incremented by 1.
