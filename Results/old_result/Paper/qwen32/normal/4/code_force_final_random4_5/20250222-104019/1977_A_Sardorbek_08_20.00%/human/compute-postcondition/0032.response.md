The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) and their constraints, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is `print('Yes')`.
2. This statement directly prints the string `'Yes'`.
3. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) are referenced in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
