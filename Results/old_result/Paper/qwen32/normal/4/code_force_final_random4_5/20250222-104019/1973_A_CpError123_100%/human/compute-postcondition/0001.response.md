In the given task, the loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are mentioned as part of the state before the loop starts, but they are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. 

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`p_1` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_2` is an integer between 0 and 30, `p_3` is an integer between 0 and 30, `t` must be greater than 0**
