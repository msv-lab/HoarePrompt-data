Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set containing the same elements as `a`. If `t1` (which is `(a[i] + 1) % n`) is not in `present` and `t2` (which is `(a[i] + 2) % n`) is in `present`, then `ans` is `x - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`.**
