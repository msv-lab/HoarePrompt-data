To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step by step using the initial state provided:

The expression to be printed is:
```
int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases (not directly used in the expression).
   - `n`: An integer input.
   - `a`: An integer input.
   - `b`: An integer input, where `b > a`.
   - `b - a >= n`: A condition that must be satisfied.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `int()` function is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.
   - We need to evaluate this expression based on the given conditions.

3. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - First, calculate `2 * b - n + 1`.
   - Then, multiply the result by `n`.
   - Finally, divide the result by `2` and convert it to an integer using `int()`.

4. **Understanding the Condition:**
   - The condition `b - a >= n` implies that the difference between `b` and `a` is at least `n`. This condition ensures that the values of `b` and `a` are such that the expression inside the print statement is valid.

### Output Calculation:

Given the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`, let's see what it evaluates to:

- **Step 1:** Compute `2 * b - n + 1`.
- **Step 2:** Multiply the result by `n`.
- **Step 3:** Divide the result by `2`.
- **Step 4:** Convert the result to an integer.

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute a specific numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output Description:

The print statement will output the integer value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2) (where b > a and b - a >= n)**
