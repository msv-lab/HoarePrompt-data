The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables outside of the loop or within the loop for that iteration. Since there is no loop structure provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, none of the variables `L`, `t`, `m`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `M`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, or `cost` are altered by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`L` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t`; `m` is `min(m, L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in ascending order; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is a list of integers, which is either `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, or `M[:q]` with the last element removed if `n * m != k`; `w` is the last element of the original `N` if `n * m != k`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
