The code snippet `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the `queue` and assigns it to `current`, and the next element (which is not explicitly shown but implied to be the distance or some related value) is assigned to `dist`.

Given the initial state, `queue` is a deque containing a node `next_node`. After executing the code, `queue` will no longer contain `next_node`, and `current` will be set to `next_node`. The value of `dist` will be updated to whatever value was next in the deque after `next_node`.

Since `visited` contains all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node`, and `current` is updated to `next_node`, the state of `visited` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing nodes in the tree such that 1 <= start <= n and 1 <= target <= n; `tree` is a dictionary where `tree[i]` contains the neighbors of node i; `queue` is a deque that no longer contains `next_node`; `visited` is a set containing all nodes that are reachable from `start` including `next_node`; `current` is `next_node`; `dist` is updated to the next value in the deque after `next_node`.**
