The code provided is `prev = i`. Given that `r2` is `'<'`, we infer that `i` is the current value being compared, and it is less than the user's previous input. The variable `prev` is updated to the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest integer `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which the user's response was `'<'`, `prev` is `i`, `r` is `'='`, `r2` is `'<'`**.

In simple terms, the variable `prev` is now set to the value of `i`, which is the most recent integer that the user responded to with `'<'`. All other variables retain their initial values.
