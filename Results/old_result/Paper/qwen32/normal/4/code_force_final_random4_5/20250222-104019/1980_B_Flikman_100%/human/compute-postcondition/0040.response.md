Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is the list `a` sorted in descending order. If `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is 2; otherwise, `removed_count` is 1. `favorite_count` is undefined, `i` is `i + 1`.**
