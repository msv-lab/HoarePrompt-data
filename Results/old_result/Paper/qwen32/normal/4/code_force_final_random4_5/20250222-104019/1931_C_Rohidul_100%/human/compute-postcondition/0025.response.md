To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all possible iterations, let's analyze the loop and the given states:

The loop condition is:
```python
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
```
This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `r` is greater than `l` and the elements at positions `r` and `r - 1` are the same.

The loop body is:
```python
    r -= 1
    end += 1
```
This means that in each iteration, `r` is decremented by 1, and `end` is incremented by 1.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
1. After 1 iteration: `r` is `l`, `a[l] == a[l + 1]`, and `end` is incremented by 1.
2. After 2 iterations: `r` is `l`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, and `end` is incremented by 1.
3. After 3 iterations: `r` is `l`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, and `end` is incremented by 2.

This suggests that `r` is equal to `l` after the first iteration and remains so in subsequent iterations. This implies that the condition `r > l` is no longer satisfied after the first iteration, and the loop should terminate.

Therefore, the loop will execute exactly once if the initial condition `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true. After this single iteration, `r` will be equal to `l`, and the loop will terminate.

So, the final output state will be:
- `r` will be equal to `l`.
- `end` will be incremented by 1.

The state of `st` and `a` will remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.

Output State: **`r` is `l`, `end` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the index `r` will be the same as `l`, and the variable `end` will have been incremented by 1. The values of `st` and the array `a` will remain as they were initially.
