The code snippet assigns the value `0` to `low` and `n - 1` to `high`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`n` is the first value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the second value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise `pos` is -1; `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`.**
