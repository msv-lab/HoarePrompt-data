The code snippet assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. Given that `suffZero` is initially `[0]`, `len(suffZero) - 1` will be `0`. Therefore, `zr` will be `0`.

The other variables (`s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `i`, and `el`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5 * 10^5; `pre` is a list of 1-based indices of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that index in the original list `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is `[0]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `i` is `n - 1`; `el` is `s1[n - 1]` and `el` is equal to '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `0`.**
