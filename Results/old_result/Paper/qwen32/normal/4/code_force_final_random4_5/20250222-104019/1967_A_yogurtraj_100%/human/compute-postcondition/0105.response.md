The code snippet updates the value of `r` to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 3, the new value of `r` will be `a[3] + k // 4`.

Other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `ii` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is either 0 or `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is either 0 or `n - 1 - i`, and `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`. `i` is 3.**
