Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by using a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the graph of disks that are tangent to each other. However, the logic in the program is flawed, and it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to adjust the radii to meet the problem's requirements.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. **Graph Representation**: The program does not explicitly build a graph representation of the tangencies between disks. Instead, it relies on the `dfs` function to explore the tangencies dynamically, which can lead to incorrect results if not handled properly.
2. **DFS Logic**: The DFS logic inside the `dfs` function is not correctly implemented to determine if the radii can be adjusted while maintaining tangency and reducing the sum of the radii.
3. **Global Variables**: The `dfs` function relies on global variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, `nodes`, and `n`), which is not a good practice and can lead to bugs if the function is used in a different context or if there are multiple instances of the problem.
4. **Condition for YES/NO**: The condition `ok = ok or c1 != 0` is not a correct condition to determine if the radii can be adjusted as required. The program does not consider the actual radii values and their sums.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:
1. Build an adjacency list or matrix representing the tangencies between disks.
2. Perform a DFS or BFS to explore the connected components of tangent disks.
3. For each connected component, determine if it is possible to adjust the radii while maintaining tangency and reducing the sum of the radii.
4. The key insight is that within a connected component, the sum of the radii can be reduced if there is at least one disk that can have its radius decreased without causing any disk to overlap or lose tangency with another disk.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
