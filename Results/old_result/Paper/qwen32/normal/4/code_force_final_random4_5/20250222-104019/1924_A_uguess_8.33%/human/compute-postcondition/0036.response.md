In the provided for loop statement:

```python
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on these variables. Specifically, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, because `range(k)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `k-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input
- `s` is the input string
- `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`
- `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`
- `cnt` is less than `n`
- `tmp` is an empty string
- `ans` is a string consisting of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times

The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `k`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `tmp`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

Thus, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes is:
State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5, `k` must be greater than 0, `n`, `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is the input string, `cnt` is the total number of times the first `k` distinct characters (in any order) appear consecutively in `s`, `cur` is the state of the bit mask after processing all characters in `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is a string consisting of the k-th letter of the alphabet repeated `cnt` times**
