Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is the value of the user input, `e` is the value of the user input. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is set to `j + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to the index of `d[j]` in `e[k:]` plus 1 plus `k`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is set to `j + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition captures the behavior of the if-else block, detailing the conditions under which `j` and `k` are updated and when the loop or if statement is broken.
