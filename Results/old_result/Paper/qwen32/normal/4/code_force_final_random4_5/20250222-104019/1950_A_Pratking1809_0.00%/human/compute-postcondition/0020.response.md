The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `q`, `i`, and `mn` have specific values and constraints, but these are not modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, `q` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mn` is 100.**
