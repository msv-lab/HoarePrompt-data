You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list and computes the sum of the elements at even indices (0-based), then prints this sum.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given 2n integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform n moves where in each move, we pick two integers, add the smaller of the two to our score, and erase both integers.
   - The goal is to maximize the final score after n moves.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the score, we should aim to maximize the sum of the smallest elements in each pair.
   - Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the smallest elements are paired together.
   - By summing every second element starting from the first (i.e., A[0], A[2], A[4], ...), we effectively sum the smaller elements of each pair (since the array is sorted).

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of 2n integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first (A[0], A[2], A[4], ...) and prints this sum.
   - The process is repeated for all test cases.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - For the first test case (`n=1`, numbers `2 3`):
     - After sorting, the array is `2 3`.
     - Sum of every second element starting from the first is `2`.
   - For the second test case (`n=2`, numbers `1 1 2 1`):
     - After sorting, the array is `1 1 1 2`.
     - Sum of every second element starting from the first is `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the third test case (`n=3`, numbers `1 1 1 1 1 1`):
     - After sorting, the array is `1 1 1 1 1 1`.
     - Sum of every second element starting from the first is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by summing the smallest elements in each pair after sorting the array. Therefore, the program is correct.
