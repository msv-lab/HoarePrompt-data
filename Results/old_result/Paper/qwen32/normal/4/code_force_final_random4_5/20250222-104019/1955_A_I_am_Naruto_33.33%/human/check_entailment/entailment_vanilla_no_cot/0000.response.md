Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy exactly `n` yogurts, considering both the regular price for one yogurt and the promotion price for two yogurts.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts under promotion).

2. **Logic to Calculate Minimum Cost**:
    - If `n > 1`:
        - `ans1` is calculated as `a * n`, which is the cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
        - `ans2` is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`, which is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and pays the regular price for any remaining yogurt.
        - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
    - If `n == 1`:
        - Maxim can only buy one yogurt, so the cost is simply `a`.

3. **Output**:
    - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case on a separate line.

Let's test the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
    - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
    - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
    - Minimum cost is `9`, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
    - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
    - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
    - Minimum cost is `14`, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
    - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
    - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
    - Minimum cost is `15`, which matches the expected output.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
    - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
    - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
    - Minimum cost is `20`, which matches the expected output.

All test cases match the expected output, confirming that the program is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
