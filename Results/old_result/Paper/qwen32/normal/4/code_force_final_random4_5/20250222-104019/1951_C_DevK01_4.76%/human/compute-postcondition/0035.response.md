To determine the new state after the provided Python code snippet is executed, we need to evaluate how the `cost` variable changes based on the given initial state.

The initial state includes:
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `t` is `t - 1`.
- `n` is the length of `N`.
- `m` is `min(m, k)`.
- `k` is `L[2]`.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
- `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed.
- `w` is the last element of the original `N`.
- `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `cost` is `mu * w`.

The code snippet is:
```python
cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
```

Let's break down the new value of `cost`:
- `m * sum(N)`: This term calculates `m` times the sum of the elements in `N`.
- `m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2)`: This term calculates `m` squared times the number of ways to choose 2 items from `n-1` items (which is the binomial coefficient "n-1 choose 2").
- `n * m * mu`: This term calculates `n` times `m` times `mu`.

Adding these to the original `cost` gives us the new `cost`.

Thus, the updated `cost` is:
\[ \text{cost} = \text{mu} \times \text{w} + \text{m} \times \text{sum(N)} + \text{m}^2 \times \frac{(\text{n} - 1) \times (\text{n} - 2)}{2} + \text{n} \times \text{m} \times \text{mu} \]

The other variables (`L`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `M`, `q`, `N`, `w`, and `mu`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the length of `N`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
