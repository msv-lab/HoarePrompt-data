The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `x - 2`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `present`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, and `present` is a set containing the same elements as `a`; `ans` is `x - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 0 to n-1, `present` is a set containing the same elements as `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`.**
