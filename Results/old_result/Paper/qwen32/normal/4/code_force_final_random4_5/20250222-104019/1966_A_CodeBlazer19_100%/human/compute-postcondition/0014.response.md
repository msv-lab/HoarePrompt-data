Let's break down the provided initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
2. `i` is initialized to 1.
3. `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
4. `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.
5. `p` is a list of integers representing the frequency of each unique element in `l`.
6. There is a condition that checks if the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`. However, the condition result is not directly relevant to the print statement in question.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(k - 1)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement directly outputs the value of `k - 1`. From the initial state, we know that `k` is an integer read from the input, and it can be any integer value. However, the exact value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, so we will represent the output in terms of `k`.

### Output:
The print statement will output `k - 1`.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is an integer read from the input)**
