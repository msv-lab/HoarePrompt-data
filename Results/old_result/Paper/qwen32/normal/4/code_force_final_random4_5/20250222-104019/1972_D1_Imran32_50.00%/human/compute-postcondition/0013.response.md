Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` remains the same (its exact value is not specified).
- `k` remains the same (its exact value is not specified).
- `root` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
- `ans` is calculated as `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` from 2 to `root`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `root`:**
   - `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - This means `root` is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one.

2. **Calculate `ans`:**
   - `ans` is `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` ranging from 2 to `root`.
   - This involves iterating over each integer `i` from 2 to `root`, computing `(n + i) // (i * i)`, and summing these values.
   - Finally, `n` is added to this sum to get `ans`.

3. **Output Description:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the final value of `ans`.
   - Since `n` and `k` are not explicitly provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
   - However, we can describe `ans` precisely based on the given formula.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` which is `n` plus the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for `i` from 2 to `root` (where `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`).

Output: **ans (where ans is n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for i from 2 to root, and root is int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)**
