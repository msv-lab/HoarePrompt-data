The code snippet provided is `ans1 += a[i]`. This line adds the value of `a[i]` to the current value of `ans1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n
- the array `a` contains `n` integers sorted in descending order where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000
- `i` is `x` if `x > 0`, otherwise `i` is `1`
- `ans2` is equal to `ans1`
- `ans1` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the array `a` minus the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` each multiplied by 2 plus `a[i]` minus `a[i + x] * 2` if `i + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged
- `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`

After the execution of `ans1 += a[i]`, the value of `ans1` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains `n` integers sorted in descending order where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `i` is `x` if `x > 0`, otherwise `i` is `1`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1` before the increment; `ans1` is updated to `ans1` before the increment plus `a[i]`; `ans` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.**
