The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. Since `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then the current values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `ans`, and `p2` does not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head. The only thing that needs to be adjusted is the loop control variable `_`.

If `_` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then the current values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is calculated as `int((2b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`; and `p2` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`; `_` is incremented by 1**
