The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range limit `4`, so we can only adjust `i` for the loop to execute one more time. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `4`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by `1`.

State: **`x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` must be a non-zero integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 2**
