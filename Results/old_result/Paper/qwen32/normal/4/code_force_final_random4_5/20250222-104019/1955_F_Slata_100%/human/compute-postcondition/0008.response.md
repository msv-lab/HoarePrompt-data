To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to break down the expression into its components and understand how each part is calculated.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Breakdown of the Expression:

1. **Integer Division (`//`)**:
   - `a // 2`: This operation performs integer division of `a` by 2, which means it divides `a` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
   - `b // 2`: Similarly, this operation divides `b` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
   - `c // 2`: This operation divides `c` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.
   - `d // 2`: This operation divides `d` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

2. **Modulo Operation (`%`)**:
   - `a % 2`: This operation gives the remainder when `a` is divided by 2. The result will be either 0 (if `a` is even) or 1 (if `a` is odd).
   - `b % 2`: This operation gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 2. The result will be either 0 (if `b` is even) or 1 (if `b` is odd).
   - `c % 2`: This operation gives the remainder when `c` is divided by 2. The result will be either 0 (if `c` is even) or 1 (if `c` is odd).
   - `d % 2`: This operation gives the remainder when `d` is divided by 2. The result will be either 0 (if `d` is even) or 1 (if `d` is odd).

3. **Sum of Remainders**:
   - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2`: This expression calculates the sum of the remainders when `a`, `b`, and `c` are divided by 2.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This expression checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` is equal to 3. If it is, the expression evaluates to `1` (True), otherwise it evaluates to `0` (False).

4. **Final Sum**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This final expression sums up the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, and adds `1` if all three of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd (i.e., their remainders when divided by 2 are all 1).

### Explanation of the Output:
The expression calculates the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, and adds `1` if all three of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd. The value of `d` does not affect the additional `1` since it only checks the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus `1` if `a`, `b`, and `c` are all odd.

Output: **a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)**
