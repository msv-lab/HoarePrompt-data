The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers and currently have the same value. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet does not reference `n` or `k` at all. Instead, it simply prints the integer `1`.

Given that the `print` statement is not dependent on the values of `n` or `k`, the output will be the constant value `1`.

Output: **1**
