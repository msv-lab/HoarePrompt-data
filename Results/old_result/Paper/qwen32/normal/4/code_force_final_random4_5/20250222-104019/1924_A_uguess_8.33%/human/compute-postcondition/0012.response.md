Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a non-empty input string; `cnt` is 1; `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
