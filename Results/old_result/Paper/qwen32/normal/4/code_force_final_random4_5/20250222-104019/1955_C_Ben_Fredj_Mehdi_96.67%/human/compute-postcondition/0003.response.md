The code snippet extracts the first integer from the string `a` by finding the substring before the first space character and converting it to an integer. This value is then assigned to the variable `n`.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. The variable `a` is also unchanged as it is the value provided by the input function. The new variable `n` is assigned the integer value extracted from the beginning of `a` up to the first space.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `a` is the value provided by the input function; `n` is the integer value extracted from the beginning of `a` up to the first space.**
