**Reasoning:**

The original program provided does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted array elements, which is not the expected output. The problem requires rearranging the array elements to maximize the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. 

The correct approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array and then calculate the beauty using the sorted array. The original assessment correctly points out that the program should calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not just print the sorted array.

The annotated code confirms that the current implementation sorts the array and converts the sorted integers to strings before joining and printing them. This behavior is consistent with the original assessment, which states that the program does not compute the required beauty value.

Here is a corrected version of the program, as mentioned in the original assessment:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += ar[i] - ar[i-1]
        print(beauty)
```

This corrected version sorts the array and then calculates the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to solve the problem.

**Final: False**
