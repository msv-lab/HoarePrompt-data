### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the described operations. However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the frequency of each card number, but it incorrectly limits the frequency to `k`. This means that if a card number appears more than `k` times, it will only count up to `k` occurrences. This is not the correct approach because the operation allows you to exchange any `k` cards with the same number, regardless of how many times that number appears in total.

2. **Incorrect Decision Making**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if true. This logic is flawed because the presence of `k` in the frequency table does not directly correlate with the minimum number of cards that can be left. Instead, we need to consider the total number of cards and how they can be reduced using the allowed operations.

3. **Lack of Proper Reduction Logic**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to actually reduce the number of cards based on the operations. It should calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations optimally.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations. It incorrectly handles the frequencies and makes flawed decisions based on these frequencies. A correct solution would involve calculating the total number of cards that can be removed using the operations and then determining the minimum number of cards that remain.
