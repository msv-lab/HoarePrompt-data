The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the variable `pow`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, `tot`), which retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1; `n` is 0; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `L` is an empty list; `tot` is 0; `pow` is 1.**
