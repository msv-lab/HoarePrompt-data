### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - For each city, determine the closest city and the cost to travel to it.
   - The closest city is the one with the minimum distance. If the closest city is the next city, the cost is 1 coin; otherwise, it's the actual distance.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Calculate the prefix sums of the costs to reach the closest cities in both forward and backward directions.
   - This allows efficient calculation of the total cost to travel through a sequence of closest cities.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, determine the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - This can be either the sum of the costs through the closest cities or the direct distance.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:

1. **Closest City Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine whether the next city is the closest city and mark it with `1`, otherwise store the distance to the next city.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the closest city logic. It only checks if the next city is closer and marks it with `1`, but it does not store the actual distance to the closest city if it's not the next city.
   - The function should calculate the distance to both the previous and next cities and select the minimum distance.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the output of `func_1`, which is incorrect.
   - The prefix sums should accumulate the actual distances to the closest cities, not just the `1` or the distance to the next city.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - The program uses the prefix sums to calculate the cost but does not correctly handle the cases where the starting city is greater than the ending city.
   - The program does not compare the cost of traveling through closest cities with the direct distance between the cities.

#### Correctness of the Program:

- The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the program.
- The function `func_1` does not correctly determine the closest city and its cost.
- The prefix sums are calculated incorrectly, leading to incorrect results.
- The query handling logic does not correctly compare the cost of traveling through closest cities with the direct distance.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the original assessment. The program does not correctly calculate the closest cities and their costs, and it does not handle the prefix sums and queries correctly.

**Final: False**
