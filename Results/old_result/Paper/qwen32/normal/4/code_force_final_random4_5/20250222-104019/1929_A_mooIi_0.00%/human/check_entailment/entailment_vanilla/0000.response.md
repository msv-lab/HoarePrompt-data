Reasoning:
The provided Python program does not solve the problem as described. The task is to rearrange the elements of the array in such a way that the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) from i=2 to n is maximized. To achieve this, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. However, the given program sorts the array and then prints the sorted array as a string, which is not the required output. The program should calculate the maximum beauty of the array based on the sorted order and print that value instead.

The correct approach would be:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   a. Read the length of the array.
   b. Read the array elements.
   c. Sort the array.
   d. Calculate the beauty of the array as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   e. Print the calculated beauty.

The given program does not perform these steps correctly and instead prints the sorted array elements as a string, which is not the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
