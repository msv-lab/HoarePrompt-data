Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.
- `x` is less than or equal to `y`.

The `print(y, x)` statement will output the values of `y` and `x` in that order.

Since `y` is the second integer from the input and `x` is the first integer from the input, and given that `x` is less than or equal to `y`, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **y, x (where y is the second integer from the input and x is the first integer from the input such that x ≤ y)**
