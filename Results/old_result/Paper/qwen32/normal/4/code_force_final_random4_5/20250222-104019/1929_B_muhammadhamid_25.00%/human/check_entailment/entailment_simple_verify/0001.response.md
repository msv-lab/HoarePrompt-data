Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to verify its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Grid and Diagonals**:
    - The square grid is of size `n x n`.
    - There are `4n - 2` diagonals in total:
        - `n` diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right.
        - `n` diagonals running from top-right to bottom-left.
        - Two of these diagonals are the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the grid.

2. **Objective**:
    - Sasha wants to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

3. **Key Observations**:
    - If `k == 1`, only one cell is needed to cover one diagonal.
    - If `k <= 2 * n`, it is possible to color cells in a way that each colored cell covers two diagonals (one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left). Thus, the minimum number of cells needed is `ceil(k / 2)`.
    - If `k > 2 * n`, some diagonals will not be able to share a cell with another diagonal. Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is `k // 2 + 1` because we need to ensure that the remaining diagonals each get at least one unique cell.

### Program Analysis

Let's verify the provided program against the above analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cells**:
    - If `k == 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because only one cell is needed to cover one diagonal.
    - If `k <= 2 * n`, the program correctly calculates `ceil(k / 2)` using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
    - If `k > 2 * n`, the program correctly calculates `k // 2 + 1`.

### Detailed Validation Using Annotations

Let's use the annotated version to validate the logic:

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

- **State Before Function Call**:
    - `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`.
    - For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^8` and `1 <= k <= 4n - 2`.

- **State During Loop Iteration**:
    - For each test case, `n` and `k` are read from the input.
    - If `k == 1`, the program outputs `1`.
    - If `k <= 2 * n`, the program outputs `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
    - If `k > 2 * n`, the program outputs `k // 2 + 1`.

### Example Validation

Let's validate the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**:
    - Input: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
    - Calculation: `k <= 2 * n` (4 <= 6), so `math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`
    - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**:
    - Input: `n = 3`, `k = 3`
    - Calculation: `k <= 2 * n` (3 <= 6), so `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`
    - Output: `2` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**:
    - Input: `n = 3`, `k = 10`
    - Calculation: `k > 2 * n` (10 > 6), so `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`
    - Output: `6` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**:
    - Input: `n = 3`, `k = 9`
    - Calculation: `k > 2 * n` (9 > 6), so `9 // 2 + 1 = 5`
    - Output: `5` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**:
    - Input: `n = 4`, `k = 7`
    - Calculation: `k > 2 * n` (7 > 8), so `7 // 2 + 1 = 4`
    - Output: `4` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6**:
    - Input: `n = 7`, `k = 11`
    - Calculation: `k > 2 * n` (11 > 14), so `11 // 2 + 1 = 6`
    - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7**:
    - Input: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
    - Calculation: `k > 2 * n` (3 > 4), so `3 // 2 + 1 = 2`
    - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all test cases based on the logic derived from the problem analysis. The annotations confirm the state of the program at key points, and the calculations match the expected outputs.

Final: **True**
