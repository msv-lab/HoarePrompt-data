You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). The test case also includes a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `L`, `M`, `q`, and `N` hold the values from the last iteration. The final `cost` for the last iteration has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It returns a value based on the given constraints and the provided list. Specifically, if the conditions related to `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list are met, it computes and returns a result; otherwise, it may handle the input according to predefined rules (e.g., constraints violations).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
