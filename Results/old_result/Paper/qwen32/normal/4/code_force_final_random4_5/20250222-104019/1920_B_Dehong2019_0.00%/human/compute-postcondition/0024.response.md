The provided code snippet only contains a single line that calculates the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` and assigns it to `ans`. The values of `ans1`, `ans2`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a` do not change through this operation. The variable `i` is also not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `x` are integers read from the input where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n; the array `a` contains `n` integers sorted in descending order where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000; `i` is `x` if `x` > 0, otherwise `i` is `1`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1` before the increment; `ans1` is updated to `ans1` before the increment plus `a[i]`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`. `ans` is the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.**
