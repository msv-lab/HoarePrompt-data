Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, representing the number of elements, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and the maximum number of elements Bob can negate, respectively.
   - It then reads the list of integers `a` representing the array elements.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This allows us to easily identify the smallest and largest elements.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum of all elements in the array `s` is calculated.
   - The sum of the `x` largest elements in the array `s2` is calculated.

4. **Initial Potential Result Calculation:**
   - The initial potential result `pos[0]` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`. This represents the sum of the array after Bob negates the `x` largest elements.

5. **Iterative Calculation of Potential Results:**
   - The program iterates through the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 1 to `k`).
   - For each number of removals `i`:
     - The sum of the array `s` is reduced by the `i`-th largest element.
     - The sum of the `x` largest elements `s2` is adjusted by removing the `i`-th largest element.
     - If the total number of negated elements (initial `x` plus `i` removals) does not exceed the array length, the sum `s2` is increased by the new largest element that can be negated.
     - The potential result for this scenario is calculated and added to the list `pos`.

6. **Result Selection:**
   - The maximum value in the list `pos` is selected as the final result for the test case. This represents the optimal sum of the array after both Alice and Bob play optimally.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Alice's Strategy:** By removing the largest elements first, Alice maximizes the sum reduction.
- **Bob's Strategy:** By negating the largest elements first, Bob minimizes the sum.
- **Iterative Adjustment:** The program correctly adjusts the sum based on the number of removals and negations, ensuring that the optimal strategy is considered for both players.
- **Edge Cases:** The program handles various edge cases, such as when `k` or `x` is equal to `n`, and when `k` or `x` is 1.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob and calculates the final sum of the array after the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
