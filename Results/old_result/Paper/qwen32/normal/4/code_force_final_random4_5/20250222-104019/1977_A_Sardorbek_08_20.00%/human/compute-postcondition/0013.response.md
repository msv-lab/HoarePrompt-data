The `print('No')` statement in the given code snippet directly outputs the string 'No' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `q`.

Here's the breakdown of the variables provided in the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100.
- `a` is an integer such that `a >= 1`.
- `b` and `c` are integers read from the input, with `b` not equal to `c` and `b` greater than or equal to `c`.
- `q` is a tuple containing `b` and `c`.
- The condition `a % 2 != b % 2` is also provided, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.

Since the `print` statement is `print('No')`, it simply outputs the string 'No'.

Output: **No**
