The code calculates two new variables `a` and `b` based on the value of `k`. Specifically, `a` is assigned the ceiling of `k / 2`, and `b` is assigned the floor of `k / 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; Additionally, `k` is less than the sum of `nums`; `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`; `b` is `k // 2`.**
