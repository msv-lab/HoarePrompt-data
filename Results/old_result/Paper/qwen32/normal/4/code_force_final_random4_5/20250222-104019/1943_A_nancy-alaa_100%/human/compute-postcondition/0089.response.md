To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables `i` and `n`. Given the loop statement `for i in range(n + 1):`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. The variable `n` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

From the provided state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be at least 0.
- `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp` with the value 1 if and only if `first` is True. If `mpp[i]` is 1, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change in the state.

Let's break it down:

1. **Variable `i`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
2. **Variable `n`:** This value does not change based on the loop head, so it remains the same.

The state of `first` and the dictionary `mpp` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted according to the loop statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `i`.

State: **`n` must be at least 0, and `i` is incremented by 1 (i.e., if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it is now `x + 1`). If `mpp[i]` is 1, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change in the state.**

Since we are only adjusting the variables in the loop head, the final state is:

State: **`n` must be at least 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
