Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` (starting from index 1) that is different from `s[0]`, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True. Additionally, `x` is not equal to `-1`, meaning there is at least one character in `s` (other than the first character) that is different from `s[0]`. The current value of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is False.**
