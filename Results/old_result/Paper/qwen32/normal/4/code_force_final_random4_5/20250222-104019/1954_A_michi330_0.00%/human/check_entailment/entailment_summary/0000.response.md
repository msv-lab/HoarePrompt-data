### Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, given that Bob can repaint up to `k` parts.

1. **Case when `n <= k`:** If the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can simply repaint all parts to the same color, no matter how Alice paints them initially. Hence, in this case, Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color, and the correct answer is `NO`.

2. **Case when `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`:** This condition is a bit more complex. Here, `math.ceil(n / m)` represents the smallest number of colors needed to ensure that no single color is used for more than `k` parts. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means that even if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible, Bob can still repaint a subset of parts to make all parts the same color. Hence, the correct answer is `NO`.

3. **Otherwise:** If neither of the above conditions is met, it implies that Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no single color is used for more than `k` parts, and thus, Bob cannot repaint a subset of parts to make all parts the same color. Hence, the correct answer is `YES`.

The provided program correctly implements this logic and prints `NO` or `YES` based on the conditions described.
