Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in a tree; `k`, an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 1 <= k < n; and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b in the tree. The function likely returns a result related to the structure of the tree after removing k edges, such as the number of connected components or a description of these components.**
