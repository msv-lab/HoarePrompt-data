The code snippet provided sets the variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`cnt`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`). The only change is that `cur` is explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is `t - 2`, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 2 characters, `ss` is `s[1]`, `cur_ss` is the integer value `ord(s[1]) - ord('a')`, `cur` is 0.**
