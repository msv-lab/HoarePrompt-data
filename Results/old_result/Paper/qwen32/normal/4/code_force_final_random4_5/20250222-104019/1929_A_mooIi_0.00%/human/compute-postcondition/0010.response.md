The code snippet takes the input, converts it into a list of integers, sorts this list, and then converts each integer back into a string, creating a map object `ar` that contains these sorted string integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` is the integer provided by the input; `ar` is a map object containing sorted string integers from the input.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 500. The value of `n` remains the integer provided by the input. The variable `ar` is now a map object containing the sorted string representations of integers provided in the input.
