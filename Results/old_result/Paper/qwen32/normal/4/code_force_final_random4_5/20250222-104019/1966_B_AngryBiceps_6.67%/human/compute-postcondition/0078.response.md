Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State Analysis
1. **Variable `t`**: The description `t is t-1` is somewhat ambiguous, but it suggests that `t` is being decremented from some previous value. However, for the purpose of determining the print statement, the value of `t` is not needed.
2. **Variable `n`**: This is the first integer read from the new input. It represents the number of strings in the list `a`.
3. **Variable `m`**: This is the second integer read from the new input. It is not directly relevant to the print statement.
4. **List `a`**: This is a list containing `n` input strings.
5. **String `first_row`**: This is a string composed of the first characters of each string in the list `a`.
6. **String `last_row`**: This is a string composed of the last characters of each string in the list `a`.
7. **Variable `i`**: This is set to `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`.
8. **Condition**: Either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1 or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`. This condition must be true for the print statement to execute, but it does not affect the output of the print statement itself.

### Print Statement Analysis
The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Explanation
The print statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The condition mentioned in the initial state ensures that the print statement is executed, but it does not influence the content of the string being printed. The output is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, or `i`.

### Final Output
Output: **YES**
