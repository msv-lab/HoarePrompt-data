Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is an integer such that a >= 1, `b` and `c` are integers read from the input, and `q` is a tuple (`b`, `c`). If `b` equals `c`, no additional changes are made to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `c`, and `b` is less than `c`, no additional changes are made to `a`. Otherwise, `a % 2` equals `b % 2`.**
