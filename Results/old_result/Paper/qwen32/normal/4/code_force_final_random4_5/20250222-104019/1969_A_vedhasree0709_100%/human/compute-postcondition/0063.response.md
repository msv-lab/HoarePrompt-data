The value of `i` is incremented by 1, as per the given code snippet. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `p`, `q`, `j`) remain unchanged unless `i` meets a specific condition that modifies `j` in the subsequent code (which is not included in the provided snippet). Since the code only increments `i`, we update the value of `i` accordingly and keep the rest of the variables as they were described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 1; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is the element of the list `l` at index `i`; `q` is the element of the list `l` at index `p - 1`; `i` is now `i + 1` and must be less than `n - 1`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to `j`.**
