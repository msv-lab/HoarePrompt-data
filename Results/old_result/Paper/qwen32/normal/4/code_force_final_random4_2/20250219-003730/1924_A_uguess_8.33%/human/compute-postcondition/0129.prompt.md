Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cur` is 0, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `s` is the input string; `cnt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `cnt` is 0 if `cur` is not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` is 1; `cur_ss` is 2; `cur` is 0 if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cur` remains the same as its initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is set to 0, and `cur_ss` is the position of the third element of `s` in the alphabet. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, and `cur` and `cur_ss` retain their values as described in the precondition. `ss` is the third element of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `ss` is the fourth element of `s`; `cur_ss` is `ord(s[3]) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
