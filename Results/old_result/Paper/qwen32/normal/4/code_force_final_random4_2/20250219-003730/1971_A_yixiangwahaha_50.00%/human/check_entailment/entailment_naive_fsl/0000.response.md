Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle the number of test cases correctly. The problem description states that the number of test cases, `t`, can be between 1 and 100, but the program hardcoded the number of iterations as 10. This means the program will only process the first 10 test cases and ignore any additional ones if `t` is greater than 10. Additionally, if `t` is less than 10, the program will still attempt to process 10 test cases, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

To fix this, the program should use the value of `t` to determine the number of iterations in the loop, like so:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
```

This version of the program correctly handles any number of test cases between 1 and 100 as specified in the problem description.
