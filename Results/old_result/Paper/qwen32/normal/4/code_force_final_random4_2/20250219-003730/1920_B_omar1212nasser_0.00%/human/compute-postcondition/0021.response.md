To determine the Output State, we need to evaluate the expression `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` given the initial state.

Initial State:
- `removals` is 2
- `s` is `s - elements[-2] - elements[-2] - elements[-3]`
- `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0
- `pos` has elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`
- `i` is 3

The code modifies `n` as follows:
- `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`

Given that `i` is 3, the expression inside the brackets becomes:
- `n += elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]`

Let's break this down:
- `elements[-(negatives + 3)]` refers to an element in the `elements` list at the index `-(negatives + 3)`.
- `elements[-3]` refers to the third last element in the `elements` list.

Since we don't have specific values for `negatives` or `elements`, we'll keep the expression as it is and update `n` accordingly.

The new value of `n` will be:
- `n = n + elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]`

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`removals` is 2, `s` is `s - elements[-2] - elements[-2] - elements[-3]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]`, `pos` has elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, `i` is 3**

In natural language: `removals` remains 2, `s` retains its expression as `s - elements[-2] - elements[-2] - elements[-3]`, `n` is updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]`, `pos` still has elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, and `i` remains 3.
