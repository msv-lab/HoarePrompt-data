To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, so the variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

From the provided state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `1 <= k <= n`
- `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is -1

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Since `n` is already described as a positive integer, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

The variable `i` is the loop variable and does not need to be set before the loop starts because it is automatically initialized by the `range` function.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute given the current state. We only need to ensure that `n` remains a positive integer, which it already is.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**
