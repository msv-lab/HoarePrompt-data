Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, and `i` is less than `n`. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then if `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is not equal to `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s1[i + 1]`, `i` is increased by 2 and `counter` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `counter` is incremented by 1. If `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `i` is simply increased by 1.**
