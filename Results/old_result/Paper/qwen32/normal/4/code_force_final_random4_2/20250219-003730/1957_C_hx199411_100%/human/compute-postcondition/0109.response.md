Let's analyze the given initial state step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(1)` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **t**: The variable `t` is described as truthy with a value of 1.
2. **n**: The variable `n` is the first integer from the input.
3. **k**: The variable `k` is greater than 0.
4. **dp**: The variable `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8.
5. **i**: The variable `i` is initially set to `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `m + 1` at the start of the loop, and then it is updated to `i + k` within the loop.
6. **num**: The variable `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the number of times `c == r` and `c != r` occurred in the `k` iterations.
7. **m**: The variable `m` is initially `n - num` and is given to be 0 at the end of the described operations.

### Key Points to Note

- The value of `t` is explicitly given as 1.
- The `print(1)` statement does not depend on any other variables or their values. It is a simple print statement that outputs the integer 1.

### Conclusion

The `print(1)` statement will output the integer 1, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, `dp`, `i`, `num`, or `m`.

Output: **1**
