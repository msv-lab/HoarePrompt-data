### Reasoning:

The program correctly processes each test case by maintaining the minimum and maximum allowable values for `k` based on constraints of type 1 and type 2. It also keeps track of the integers that `k` cannot be (constraints of type 3). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `r` is a list that will store the result for each test case.
   - For each test case, `cx` is a set that will store the values `k` cannot be.
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) to represent the upper bound.
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the lower bound.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the program checks the type:
     - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of its current value and `x`, ensuring `k` is at least as large as `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of its current value and `x`, ensuring `k` is no larger than `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx`, indicating that `k` cannot be equal to `x`.

3. **Calculating the Result**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx > ax`. If true, it means no integer `k` can satisfy all constraints (the range is invalid), and it appends `0` to `r`.
   - If the range is valid (`bx <= ax`), the program calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`. This is done by counting how many elements in `cx` fall within `[bx, ax]` and subtracting this count from the total number of integers in the range (`ax - bx + 1`).

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results stored in `r`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all types of constraints and ensures the output is accurate for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
