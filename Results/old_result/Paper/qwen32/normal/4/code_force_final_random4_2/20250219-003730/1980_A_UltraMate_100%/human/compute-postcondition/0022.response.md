In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the key being iterated over in the dictionary `hmp`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next key in `hmp`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is calculated based on the current value of `hmp[i]`.
- `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair.

Let's assume the keys in `hmp` are ordered as `i1, i2, i3, ..., in`. If the previous iteration used key `ik`, the next iteration should use key `ik+1`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` is `k * m`. `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `i` should be the next key in `hmp` after the current `i`.

Since we do not have specific values for the keys, we can denote the next key as the successor of `i` in the iteration order of `hmp`.

State: **`ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` is `k * m`. `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current `i`.**

However, to be more precise without assuming a specific order, we can simply state that `i` should be the next key in the iteration sequence of `hmp`:

State: **`ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` is `k * m`. `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `i` is the next key in `hmp`.**
