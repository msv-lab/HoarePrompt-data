Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input.
   - `a` is less than or equal to `c`.
   - `x` is \((c - a) // 2\).
   - The absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even.
   - `r` is `min(w, b + x)`.
   - `l` is `max(1, b - x)`.

2. **Expression evaluation:**
   - `x` is calculated as \((c - a) // 2\), which means it is half the even difference between `a` and `c`.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `b + x`.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `b - x`.

3. **Print statement:**
   - The print statement uses a conditional expression to choose between two lists: `['Draw']` and `['Bob']`.
   - The condition for choosing `['Bob']` is `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`.
   - If the condition is not met, `['Draw']` is chosen.

4. **Detailed analysis of the condition:**
   - `abs(l - d) <= x` checks if the absolute difference between `l` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.
   - `abs(r - d) <= x` checks if the absolute difference between `r` and `d` is less than or equal to `x`.
   - Both conditions must be true for `['Bob']` to be printed.

5. **Possible outputs:**
   - If `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x`, the output is `['Bob']`.
   - Otherwise, the output is `['Draw']`.

Given the provided information, we cannot determine the exact values of `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, so we cannot definitively say whether the condition will be true or false. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output based on the condition.

Output: **['Bob'] if abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x, otherwise ['Draw']**
