To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions under which the `cost` variable is calculated.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `M`: A sorted list of integers.
   - `L`: A list of integers (not used in the calculation of `cost` as per the provided code snippet).
   - `t`: A variable `t` (its value is not specified and not used in the calculation of `cost`).
   - `n`: Defined as `len(N)` or `q - 1` depending on whether `n * m == k`.
   - `m`: Defined as `min(m, k)`.
   - `k`: A variable `k` (its value is not specified but is used in the calculation of `cost`).
   - `q`: Calculated as `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
   - `N`: A sublist of `M` defined as `M[:q]` or `M[:q]` with the last element removed if `n * m != k`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{cost} = m \times \text{sum}(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right)
     \]
   - If `n * m != k`, then `cost` is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{cost} = \mu \times w + m \times \text{sum}(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times (n - 2)}{2}\right) + n \times m \times \mu
     \]
     Where:
     - \(\mu = k - (n - 1) \times m\)
     - \(w\) is the last element of the original `N`.

### Explanation of the Output:

Given the initial state, the value of `cost` is dependent on the values of `m`, `k`, `n`, and the elements of `N`. Since the exact values of `M`, `k`, and `m` are not provided, we can describe the `cost` in terms of these variables.

- If `n * m == k`, the `cost` is a function of the sum of the first `q` elements of `M` and the number of elements `n`.
- If `n * m != k`, the `cost` includes an additional term \(\mu \times w\) and the sum of the first `q-1` elements of `M` (with the last element removed).

### Final Output:

The `print(cost)` statement will output the calculated `cost` based on the conditions described above.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated as m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) if n * m == k, otherwise mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu, with mu = k - (n - 1) * m and w being the last element of the original N)**
