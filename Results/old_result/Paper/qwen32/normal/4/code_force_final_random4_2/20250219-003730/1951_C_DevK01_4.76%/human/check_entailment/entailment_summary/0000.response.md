Reasoning: 

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the prices and then purchasing tickets in a greedy manner. However, there are several issues with the logic that make it incorrect.

1. **Incorrect Greedy Approach**: The program sorts the prices and then tries to buy tickets in chunks of `m` tickets up to `q` days, where `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`. This approach does not guarantee the minimum cost because it does not consider the incremental increase in prices after each purchase correctly. The program should consider the total cost after each purchase to make optimal decisions.

2. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**: The program handles the remaining tickets after buying `q` chunks of `m` tickets incorrectly. It separates the last chunk and calculates the cost differently, which doesn't necessarily lead to the minimum cost.

3. **Incremental Price Increase**: The program does not correctly update the prices incrementally after each purchase. The price increase should be applied to all subsequent days after each purchase, but the program does not account for this correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when `k` is less than `m` or when all tickets can be bought on the first day without exceeding `m`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets.

Correctness: **False**
