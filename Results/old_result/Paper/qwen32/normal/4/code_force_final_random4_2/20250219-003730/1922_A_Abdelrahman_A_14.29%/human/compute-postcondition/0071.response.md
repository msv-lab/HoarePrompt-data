The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The statement directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `slength`, `no`, and `x`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is simply `print('YES')`, which means it will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables in the initial state.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
