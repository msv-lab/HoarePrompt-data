You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. a and b are lists of integers, each of length n, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` through `c[n-1]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is `0`; `i` is `-1`.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n; `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[i]` through `c[n-1]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is `0`; `i` is `k-1`; `ans` is the minimum of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from `0` to `k-1`.`
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for all i from 0 to k-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` and `k` which are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` which are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output conditions are not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
