The given Python code snippet contains a `print(1)` statement. This statement is independent of the variables `array`, `find`, `l`, and `r` described in the initial state. The `print(1)` statement will simply output the integer `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet.
2. The code snippet only contains a `print(1)` statement.
3. The value `1` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `1`.

Output: **1**
