Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces with the first element decremented by 1 and the last element decremented by 1, and `g` is 1 if the current value of `a[g]` is 0; otherwise, `g` remains 0. If the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[d]`) is 0, then `d` is updated to `len(a) - 2`. Otherwise, `d` remains `len(a) - 1`.**
