Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input string, `first_row` is the first character of the input string, `last_row` is the last character of the input string

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the initial input string and the second element is the new input string, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input string concatenated with the first character of the new input string, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input string concatenated with the last character of the new input string, `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than `i`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the initial input string, the second element is the new input string, and the third element is the value of `input()`, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input string concatenated with the first character of the new input string and the first character of the value of `input()`, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input string concatenated with the last character of the new input string and the last character of the value of `input()`, `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
