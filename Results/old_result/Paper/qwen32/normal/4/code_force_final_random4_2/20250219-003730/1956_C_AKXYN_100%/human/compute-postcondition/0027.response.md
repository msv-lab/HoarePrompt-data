The code snippet `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` updates the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, we can calculate the new value of `res`.

- `i + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.
- `2 * i + 1` evaluates to `2 * 0 + 1`, which is `1`.
- Therefore, the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `1 * 1`, which is `1`.

Since `res` was initially `0`, adding `1` to it results in `res` being `1`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `mat` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, `i` is 0**
