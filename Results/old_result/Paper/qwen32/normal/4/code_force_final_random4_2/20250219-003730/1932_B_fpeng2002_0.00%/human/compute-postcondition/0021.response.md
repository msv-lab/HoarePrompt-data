The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range parameters (`0` and `len(nums)`). Since the loop iterates over `x` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`, we need to adjust `x` for the next iteration. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `start_year`) are not part of the loop head and should not be modified.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was some value, and for the loop to execute again, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, provided that it is still less than `len(nums)`.

Let's denote the value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration as `x_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be `x_prev + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `x_prev`, we can generalize that `x` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start_year` is `((0 + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `x` is `x + 1`**
