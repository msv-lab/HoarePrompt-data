The code snippet `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `prev`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `prev` will be updated to 1. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 1, `prev` is 1, `r` is `'<'`, and `r2` is the input provided by the user which is `'<'`.**
