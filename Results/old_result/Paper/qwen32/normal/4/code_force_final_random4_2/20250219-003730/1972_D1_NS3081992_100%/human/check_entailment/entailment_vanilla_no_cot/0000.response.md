Correctness: **False**

The provided program includes multiple functions, but only `func_15` and `func_16` are relevant to solving the given problem. The function `func_15` calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a single test case, and `func_16` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_15` for each one.

However, the logic in `func_15` is incorrect for the problem at hand. The function is supposed to count the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The current implementation does not correctly handle this condition.

Here's a brief explanation of why the current implementation is incorrect:

- The loop in `func_15` iterates over `i` from 1 to `m` and checks if `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`. This loop is attempting to count the number of valid pairs, but the condition inside the loop does not correctly reflect the problem's requirement.
- The expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` is used to count something, but it does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given condition.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the given condition using the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor. However, this approach might be too slow for the given constraints, and further optimization would be necessary to handle the maximum input sizes efficiently.
