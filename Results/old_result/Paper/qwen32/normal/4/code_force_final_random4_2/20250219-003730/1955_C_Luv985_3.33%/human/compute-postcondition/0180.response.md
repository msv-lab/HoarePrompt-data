`t` is assigned the value of `k % 2`. The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `r`, `a`, and `mi` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `a` is the list with updated integer values, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of the updated `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`.**
