Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is set to 0. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
