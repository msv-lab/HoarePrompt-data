Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of the sorted list `s` with `0` prepended, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended. If `n` equals 2, `s` has exactly one unique element (besides the prepended `0`). If `n` is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if `n-2` is even, or 0 if `n-2` is odd.**
