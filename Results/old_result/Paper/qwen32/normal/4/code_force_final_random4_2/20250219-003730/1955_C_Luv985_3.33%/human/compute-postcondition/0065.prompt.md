Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9. If `mi * 2` (where `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`) is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`; `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - mi`; `l` is set to 1 if `a[0]` was 0, otherwise `l` remains 0; `r` is set to `n - 2` if `a[n-1]` was 0, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`; `ans` is set to 2 if both `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` were 0, `ans` is set to 1 if only `a[0]` was 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `mi` is recalculated as `min(a[0], a[n-1])`. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `mi` is recalculated as `min(a[0], a[n-1])` and `mi * 2` is greater than `k`; `t` is set to `k % 2`; if `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is set to 1, otherwise `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`; `k` is positive; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each reduced by `mi`. If either `a[l]` or `a[r]` becomes 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` or `r` is adjusted accordingly. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is set to `k % 2`, `ans` remains unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`. If `a[l]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1; if `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
