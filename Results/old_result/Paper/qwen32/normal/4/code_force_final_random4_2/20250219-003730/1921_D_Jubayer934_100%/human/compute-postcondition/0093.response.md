Given the initial state, the code snippet appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `temp` is an integer less than `n`.
- `ans` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the last element is `abs(a[n-1] - b[0])`.
- `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
- `i` is `temp`.

The code snippet:
```
ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
```
appends `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to `ans`.

Thus, `ans` now contains `n+2` elements, with the last element being `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n+2` elements where the last two elements are `abs(a[n-1] - b[0])` and `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is `temp`.**
