The code snippet `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of the current value of `ax` and the input integer `x`. Given that `ax` was initially set to `1000000007`, the new value of `ax` will be `x` if `x` is less than `1000000007`; otherwise, it will remain `1000000007`.

Output State: **`a` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`, `bx` is -1, and `x` is an input integer.**
