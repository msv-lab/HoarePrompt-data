Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` where the first element is `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` distinct integers representing Cowdeforces ratings. The function returns different values based on certain conditions:
- Case_1: Returns `n - 1` under unspecified conditions.
- Case_2: Returns `k - 1` under unspecified conditions.
- Case_3: Returns a value that is one less than the first element of `ind` which is greater than `k` and not 0.
- Case_4: Returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the first element of the list `ind` that is not 0 and is less than or equal to `k`.
- Case_5: Returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
- Case_6: Returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`, which simplifies to `ind[1] - ind[0]` given the constraints.
- Case_7: Returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.**
