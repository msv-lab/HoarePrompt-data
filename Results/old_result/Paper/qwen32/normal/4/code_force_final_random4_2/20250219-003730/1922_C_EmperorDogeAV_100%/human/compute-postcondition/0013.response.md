The code snippet assigns the value of the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` to `prog_cities[i]`. Given the initial state, the values of `cities`, `prog_cities`, `i`, `back`, and `forward` are specified. The only change is the assignment to `prog_cities[i]`.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros except `prog_cities[i]` which is `abs(forward - cities[i])`; `i` is 0 or greater than 0; if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise `forward` is 999999999999999999; if `i` is 0, `back` is -999999999999999999 and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise `forward` is 999999999999999999; the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is greater than or equal to the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.**
