Given the initial state:
- `max_heap` is empty (though it's not used in the print statement, it's provided for context).
- `tp1` is `m` (though `m` is not defined in the given state, it's provided for context).
- `tp2` is -1 (though it's not used in the print statement, it's provided for context).
- `ans` is the accumulated sum of differences (though the specific differences are not provided, it's described as an accumulated sum).

From the provided information, we know that `ans` is an accumulated sum of differences, but we don't have the specific values or the context to determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. Therefore, based on the given precondition, we can only describe `ans` as the accumulated sum of differences.

Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated sum of differences)**
