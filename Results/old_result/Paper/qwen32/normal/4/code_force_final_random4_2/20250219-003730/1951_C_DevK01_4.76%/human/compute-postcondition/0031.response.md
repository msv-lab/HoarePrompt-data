Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `m` is `min(m, k)`, `k` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input, `n` is the length of `N`, `m` is `L[1]`, `k` is `L[2]`, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise the first `q-1` elements of `M` excluding the last element that was popped, `cost` is recalculated based on the new value of `q` and other variables, `w` is the last element that was popped from `N`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `w` now holds the last element that was removed from the list `N`. The list `N` itself is now missing that last element, and all other variables retain their previous values.
