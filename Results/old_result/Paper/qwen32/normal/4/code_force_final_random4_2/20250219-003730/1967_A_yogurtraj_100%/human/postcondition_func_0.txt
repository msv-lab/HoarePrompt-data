The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the sorted list `a`. The result is determined by distributing the value `k` across the elements of the list in a specific manner, and the final output is a single integer for each test case.
