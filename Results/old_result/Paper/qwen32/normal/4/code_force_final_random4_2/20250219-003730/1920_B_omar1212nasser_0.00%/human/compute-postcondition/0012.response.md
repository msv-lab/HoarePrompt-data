The code snippet appends a value to the list `pos`. The value being appended is `s - 2 * n`. The values of `removals`, `s`, and `n` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`removals` is 1; `s` is `s - elements[-i]`; if no `IndexError` occurs, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`; otherwise, `n` is 0; `pos` has an additional element `s - 2 * n`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `removals`, `s`, and `n` retain their previous values, and `pos` now includes an extra element calculated as `s - 2 * n`.
