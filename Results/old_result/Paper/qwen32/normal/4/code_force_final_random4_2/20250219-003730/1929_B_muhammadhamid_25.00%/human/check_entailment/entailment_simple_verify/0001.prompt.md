You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2

    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, consisting of:
- \( n \) diagonals from the top-left to the bottom-right (main diagonals and those parallel to them).
- \( n \) diagonals from the top-right to the bottom-left (anti-diagonals and those parallel to them).

### Key Observations

1. **Minimum Cells for Minimum Diagonals**:
   - If \( k = 1 \), we need to color only 1 cell to cover at least one diagonal.
   - If \( k \leq 2n \), we can cover \( k \) diagonals by coloring cells in a strategic manner. Specifically, coloring cells in the middle row and column can help cover multiple diagonals efficiently.
   - If \( k > 2n \), we need to cover more diagonals, and the strategy involves coloring cells in a way that maximizes the number of diagonals covered per cell.

2. **Formulating the Solution**:
   - For \( k \leq 2n \), the solution can be derived by coloring cells in a way that each cell covers as many diagonals as possible. This can be mathematically expressed as \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
   - For \( k > 2n \), the solution involves a more complex pattern but can be simplified to \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) as well, which is equivalent to \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) for odd \( k \) and \( \frac{k}{2} \) for even \( k \).

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows the above observations and logic:
- For \( k = 1 \), it directly prints 1.
- For \( k \leq 2n \), it calculates \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) using `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
- For \( k > 2n \), it calculates \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) using `k // 2 + 1`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem analysis. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
