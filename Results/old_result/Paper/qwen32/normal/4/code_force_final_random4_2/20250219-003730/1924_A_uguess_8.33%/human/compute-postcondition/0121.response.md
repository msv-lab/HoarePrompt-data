Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values. If `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is set to 0, and `cur_ss` is the position of the third element of `s` in the alphabet. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0, and `cur` and `cur_ss` retain their values as described in the precondition. `ss` is the third element of `s`.**
