The given code snippet appends a new value to the list `pos`. The value being appended is `s - 2 * s2`. The values of `s` and `s2` are affected by previous conditions and calculations, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, we will keep them as they are and update the list `pos` accordingly.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing elements `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`, `s - 2 * s2`, and now also `s - 2 * s2`. `s` is decreased by `elements[-i]`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`.**

In simpler terms, the list `pos` now includes an additional element which is `s - 2 * s2`. The values of `s` and `s2` are adjusted based on previous conditions, but their specific values are not changed in this snippet.
