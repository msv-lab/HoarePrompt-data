The code snippet `w = N.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `N`. Given the initial state, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`. After the `pop` operation, `N` will have one less element, and `w` will hold the value of the last element that was removed from `N`.

The value of `w` is the last element of `N` before the `pop` operation. Since `N` is derived from the first `q` elements of `M`, the value of `w` is `M[q-1]` (the `q`-th element of `M`).

The values of `t`, `m`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `q`, and the fact that `n * m` is not equal to `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `m` is `min(L[1], k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `n * m` is not equal to `k`.**
