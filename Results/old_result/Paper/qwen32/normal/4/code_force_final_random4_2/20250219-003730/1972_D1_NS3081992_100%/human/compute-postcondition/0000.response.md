In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the return value of the function `func_10()`. To ensure the loop executes, `func_10()` must return a positive integer. The variables `n` and `m` are mentioned in the state description but are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be directly adjusted to control the loop execution. Therefore, the only state we can adjust is the return value of `func_10()`, which we assume can be controlled or set up in such a way that it returns a positive integer.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer**
