The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Since `i` is either 4 or 5, `num` will take the value of either `ar[4]` or `ar[5]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, and `same` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `minn` is 1, `same` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 2 otherwise, and `i` is either 4 or 5; `num` is `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, or `ar[5]` if `i` is 5.**
