To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a string representing the input value.
- `x` is a list containing ten integers.
- `y` is a list containing ten integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces for the last iteration.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- The lists `x` and `y` each contain ten integers, but the exact values of these integers are not provided.
- The print statement will output the element at index 2 of the list `x` followed by a space and then the element at index 2 of the list `y`.

### Output Description:
Since the exact values of the integers in the `x` and `y` lists are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements at index 2 of these lists.

Output: **x[2]   y[2] (where x[2] is the third element of the list x and y[2] is the third element of the list y)**
