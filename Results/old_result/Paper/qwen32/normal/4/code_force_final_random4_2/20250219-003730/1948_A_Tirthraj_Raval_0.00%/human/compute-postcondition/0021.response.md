Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 49; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, nothing additional happens to `pattern`. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing `n` characters, alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A' if `n // 2` is odd and starting with 'B' if `n // 2` is even.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the user's input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet. The state of `pattern` depends on the new value of `n` and the rules provided in the initial state description.
