Postcondition: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have more than one element. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. If `vis[node]` was originally 0, then `vis[node]` is now 1 and `q` has had its leftmost element removed and includes `node` at its end. If `vis[node]` was originally 1, then `vis[node]` remains 1, `q` has had its leftmost element removed, and `node` is not added to `q`. `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`.**
