The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these variables. The `for` loop is iterating from `n` down to 1, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making it `n-1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. Since `n` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, `n-1` will also be a valid value for `i` as long as `n` is initially greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is \(n-1\)**
