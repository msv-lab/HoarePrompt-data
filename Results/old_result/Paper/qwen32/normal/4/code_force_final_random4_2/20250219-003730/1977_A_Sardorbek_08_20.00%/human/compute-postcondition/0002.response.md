Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `b` and `c`. The initial state of `t` and the conditions for `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.
