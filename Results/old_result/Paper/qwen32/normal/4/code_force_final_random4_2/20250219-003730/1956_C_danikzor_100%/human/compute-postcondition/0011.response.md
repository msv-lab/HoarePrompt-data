To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop operates and how the variables change.

The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive, and for each iteration, it prints two lines:
1. `print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))`
2. `print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))`

Where `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers from `n` down to 1.

### Analysis:
- **Initial State**: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `n` times, with `i` taking values from 1 to `n`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- The loop will execute `n` times.
- For each iteration with `i` from 1 to `n`, two lines will be printed.
- The first line of each iteration will be `1, i, n, n-1, ..., 1`.
- The second line of each iteration will be `2, i, n, n-1, ..., 1`.

### Output State Description:
- After all iterations, the output will consist of `2 * n` lines.
- Each pair of lines corresponds to an iteration of the loop with `i` ranging from 1 to `n`.
- The first line of each pair will start with `1` followed by `i` and the sequence from `n` to `1`.
- The second line of each pair will start with `2` followed by `i` and the sequence from `n` to `1`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **The output will consist of `2 * n` lines, where each pair of lines corresponds to an iteration of `i` from 1 to `n`. The first line of each pair is `1, i, n, n-1, ..., 1` and the second line is `2, i, n, n-1, ..., 1`.**
