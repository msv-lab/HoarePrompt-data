Reasoning:  
The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The task is to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The given code sorts the array and prints it, which does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty. To achieve the maximum beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the largest and smallest elements alternate as much as possible. The correct approach would be to sort the array, then interleave the smallest and largest remaining elements.

For example, in the first test case, the array [2, 1, 3] should be rearranged to [1, 3, 2] or [3, 1, 2] to achieve the maximum beauty of 2. The given code simply sorts the array and prints it, which results in [1, 2, 3] and a beauty of 2, but this is not a general solution for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
