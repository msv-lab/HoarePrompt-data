The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `a` has at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `a`, `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged except for `res` being incremented by 1 if the current element `a[i]` is 0, we only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
