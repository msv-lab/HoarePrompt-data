Postcondition: **`t` remains the same. `n` remains the same. `a` remains the same. `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. `k` is not 0 (this is the current value of `k` after entering the if condition). `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, otherwise `a[n - 1]`. `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, otherwise 0. `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, otherwise 0.**

In simple terms, after entering the if condition (`if (k != 0)`), `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. `ii` continues to increment as per the loop's previous state. The current value of `k` is not 0. Depending on whether the loop breaks, `r`, `rem`, and `y` are updated accordingly. If the loop does not break, `r` takes the value of the last element of `a`, and `k` is updated based on the last iteration.
