The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable that does not affect the loop's continuation, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1, so it remains greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
