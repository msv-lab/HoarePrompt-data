The code snippet `s -= elements[-i]` decreases the value of `s` by the value of `elements[-i]`. Given that `i` is 4, this means `s` is decreased by `elements[-4]`.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing elements `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`, `s - 2 * s2`, and now also `s - 2 * s2`. `s` is decreased by `elements[-4]`. If `negatives + i` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to `s2 + elements[-(negatives + i)]`. `i` is 4.**

In natural language: The value of `s` has been reduced by the value of the fourth element from the end of the `elements` list. All other variables retain their previous states, including `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `pos`. The condition for updating `s2` remains unchanged.
