Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by checking cumulative sums from both ends of the list. However, there are several logical flaws in the approach that make it incorrect.

Firstly, the program calculates `a` and `b` as `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively. This seems to be an attempt to split the attacks between the first and last ships. However, this does not correctly account for the situation where the Kraken switches between attacking the first and last ships.

Secondly, the program increments `ans` every time `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` or `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly reflect the number of ships that are sunk. Instead, it counts the number of times the cumulative sum from either end is less than or equal to `a` or `b`, which can happen multiple times for the same ship as the cumulative sum increases.

Lastly, the program does not correctly handle the situation where a ship's durability is reduced to zero and should no longer be considered in subsequent attacks.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.

Correctness: **False**
