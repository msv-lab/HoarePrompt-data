To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we focus on the variables in the loop condition, which is `i < len(ar)`. Here, `i` is initialized to 1, and `ar` is a list of integers. The loop will execute if `i` is less than the length of `ar`.

Given:
- `i` is 1.
- `ar` is a list of integers.

For the loop to execute, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 because `i` is already 1. If `len(ar)` is 1, the condition `i < len(ar)` would be false, and the loop would not execute.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `ar` has more than one element.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, `i` is 1**
