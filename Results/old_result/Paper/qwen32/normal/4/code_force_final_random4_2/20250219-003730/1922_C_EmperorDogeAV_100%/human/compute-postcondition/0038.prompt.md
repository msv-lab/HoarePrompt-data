You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. Additionally, there are m queries (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), each represented as a tuple of two integers (x_i, y_i) (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) indicating the cities between which the minimum travel cost is to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is uniquely determined.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns `prog_cities`, which is a list of `n - 1` integers. Each `i`-th element in `prog_cities` is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`. Otherwise, the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` representing the number of cities and a list of `n` integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. The function also accepts an integer `n` (though this seems redundant as `n` is already part of the `cities` tuple). For each city (excluding the first and last), the function determines whether the closest city is the one immediately before or after it in the list. If the closest city is the one after, it appends `1` to the result list `prog_cities`. Otherwise, it appends the absolute difference between the city and the closest city before it. The function returns `prog_cities`, a list of `n - 1` integers representing these determinations for each city.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `prog_cities`, which is a list of `n - 1` integers. Each `i`-th element in `prog_cities` is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`. Otherwise, the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
