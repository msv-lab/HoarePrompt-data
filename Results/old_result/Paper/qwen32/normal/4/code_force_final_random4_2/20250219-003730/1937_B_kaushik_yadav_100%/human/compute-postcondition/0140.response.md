The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to `len(a) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(a) - 1` for the loop to execute again. 

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1, so it must have been `j - 1` before that increment.
- For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(a) - 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j` from the previous state plus 1.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(a) - 1`**
