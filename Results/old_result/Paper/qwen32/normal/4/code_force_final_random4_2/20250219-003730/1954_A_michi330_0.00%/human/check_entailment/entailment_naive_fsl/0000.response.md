Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
- **Alice** paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
- **Bob** can repaint at most `k` parts to the same color.
- Determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Conditions for "NO" (Bob can make all parts the same color):
1. If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color.
2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

### Conditions for "YES" (Bob cannot make all parts the same color):
- If neither of the above conditions is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Program Analysis
The provided program correctly handles the conditions for "NO" and "YES" as follows:
- It checks if `n <= k` and prints "NO" if true.
- It checks if `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` and prints "NO" if true.
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

Let's verify the correctness of the program by considering a few edge cases:

1. **Case: n = 1, m = 1, k = 1**
   - `n <= k` is true, so the output is "NO".
   - This matches the example.

2. **Case: n = 5, m = 1, k = 1**
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0`, and `0 < 1` is true, so the output is "NO".
   - This matches the example.

3. **Case: n = 5, m = 2, k = 1**
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`, and `2 < 1` is false, so the output is "YES".
   - This matches the example.

4. **Case: n = 5, m = 2, k = 2**
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`, and `2 < 2` is false, so the output is "YES".
   - This does not match the example where the output should be "NO". This is an issue.

5. **Case: n = 5, m = 5, k = 3**
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4`, and `4 < 3` is false, so the output is "YES".
   - This matches the example.

### Conclusion
The program fails for the case `n = 5, m = 2, k = 2` where the expected output is "NO" but the program outputs "YES". Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation
The program incorrectly handles the case where `n - math.ceil(n / m) == k`. In such cases, Bob can still repaint all parts to the same color by repainting exactly `k` parts. The condition should be `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` instead of `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
