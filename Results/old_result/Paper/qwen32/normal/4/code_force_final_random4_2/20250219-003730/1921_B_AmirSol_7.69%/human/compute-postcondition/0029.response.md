Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, and `i` is less than `n` after being incremented. If `s1[i] != s2[i]`, then `counter` is increased by 1. If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i] != s1[i + 1]`, `i` is increased by 2; otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. If `s1[i] == s2[i]`, `i` is simply incremented by 1.**
