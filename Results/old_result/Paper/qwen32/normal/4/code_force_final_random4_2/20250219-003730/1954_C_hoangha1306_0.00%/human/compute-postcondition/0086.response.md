Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`. If `vt` was 0, then `vt` is now 1 and `kq1` and `kq2` are set based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]`: if `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is `str(x)` and `kq2` is `str(y)`, otherwise, `kq1` is `str(y)` and `kq2` is `str(x)`. If `vt` was not 0, then `kq1` is `str(y)` and `kq2` is `str(x)`.**
