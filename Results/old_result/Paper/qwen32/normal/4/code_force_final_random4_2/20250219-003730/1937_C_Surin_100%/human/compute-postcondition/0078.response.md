The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1`. Therefore, `v2` will be `n-1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the final value updated based on the responses `r` and `r2`, `v2` is `n-1`**.
