The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `mid`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to decrement `i` by 1 to reflect its state at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is `i - 1`**.

However, since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the loop, the correct state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next value of `i` before it is incremented again. Therefore, `i` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x`.
