The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of integers in the list, and a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1. There is at least one 1 in each list. The function processes these inputs and returns the count of 1s in the list for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (each being 0 or 1) with at least one 1 in the list. It returns the count of 1s in the list for each test case.**
