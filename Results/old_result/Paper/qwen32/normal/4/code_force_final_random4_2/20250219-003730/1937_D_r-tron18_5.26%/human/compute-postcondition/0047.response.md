The code snippet provided is `preOne.pop()`, which removes the last element from the list `preOne`. 

Given the initial state, `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'. After executing `preOne.pop()`, the last element of `preOne` is removed.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed; `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it contains elements `[0, i + 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `2 * suffZero[-1]`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol <= zr` and `el` is not '>', otherwise `2 * preOne[-1]` if `ol > zr` and `el` is '>', or `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `ol > zr` and `el` is not '>', or `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `ol > zr` and `el` is not '>' and `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`; `fi` is `0` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`; `i` is `k - 1`; `el` is `s1[i]`. If `ol <= zr`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. `preOne` has had its last element removed.**
