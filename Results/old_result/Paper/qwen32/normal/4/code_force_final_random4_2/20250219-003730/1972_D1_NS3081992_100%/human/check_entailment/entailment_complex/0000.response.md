To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem requirements and analyze the functionality of each function in relation to the problem statement.

### Problem Requirements
The task is to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \text{gcd}(a, b)\).

### Analysis of Functions

1. **Input Reading Functions:**
   - **func_1()**: Reads a single integer from input.
   - **func_2()**: Reads a line of integers and returns them as a map object.
   - **func_3()**: Reads a line of integers and returns them as a list.
   - **func_4(rows_number)**: Reads `rows_number` lines of integers and returns them as a list of lists.
   - **func_5()**: Reads a line of input and strips the newline character.
   - **func_6()**: Similar to func_5(), but decodes the input from bytes to string.
   - **func_7()**: Reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a list.
   - **func_8(rows)**: Reads `rows` lines of integers and returns them as a list of lists.
   - **func_9()**: Reads a line of input.
   - **func_10()**: Reads a single integer from input.
   - **func_11()**: Reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings.

2. **Other Functions:**
   - **func_12(d, processing, da, rank)**: This function seems to be related to some graph processing or recursive ranking, but it is not clear how it fits into the problem.
   - **func_13(a, b)**: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - **func_14(a, n, m, k)**: This function seems to be related to some list processing but does not fit the problem requirements.
   - **func_15()**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given `n` and `m`.
   - **func_16()**: This function orchestrates the reading of inputs and the calculation of results for multiple test cases.

### Key Function Analysis

**func_15()**:
- This function calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the provided logic.
- It iterates over possible values of `i` such that \(i \le m\) and \(i^2 \le n + i\).
- For each `i`, it increments the answer by \((n + i) // (i^2)\).
- Finally, it returns the calculated answer minus 1.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements

The provided logic in `func_15()` seems to be an optimized way to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the conditions given in the problem. The function `func_16()` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then calling `func_15()` for each test case.

### Conclusion

Given that `func_15()` correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) and `func_16()` correctly handles multiple test cases, the overall program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
