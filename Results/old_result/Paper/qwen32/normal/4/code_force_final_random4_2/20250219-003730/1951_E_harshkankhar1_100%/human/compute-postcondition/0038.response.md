Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is the index of the first character that differs from `s[0]` and `x` is not equal to -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`. Additionally, `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`. The current value of `x` is either 1, `n // 2`, or neither.**
