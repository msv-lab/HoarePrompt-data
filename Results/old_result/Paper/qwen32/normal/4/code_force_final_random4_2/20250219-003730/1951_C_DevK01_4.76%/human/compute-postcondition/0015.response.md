The code snippet `cost = mu * w` calculates the value of `cost` by multiplying `mu` and `w`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`
- `w` is `M[q-1]`

The output state will be:
- `cost` is `mu * w`
- All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `m` is `min(L[1], k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `n` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `n * m` is not equal to `k`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**
