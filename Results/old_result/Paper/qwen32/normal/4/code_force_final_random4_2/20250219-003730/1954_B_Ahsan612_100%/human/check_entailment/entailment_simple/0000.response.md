### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array of identical elements by repeatedly replacing elements `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.
2. It initializes `same` to 1 (to count consecutive identical elements) and `num` to the first element of the array.
3. It iterates through the array, counting consecutive identical elements.
4. When a different element is encountered, it updates `minn` (the minimum count of consecutive identical elements found so far) and resets `same` to 1.
5. After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time in case the longest sequence of identical elements ends at the last element of the array.
6. If `minn` is still `inf` (which should not happen given the constraints) or if `minn` equals the length of the array (meaning all elements are the same), it prints `-1`.
7. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The program only considers the minimum length of consecutive identical elements (`minn`). If the array has a structure where removing a single element from a sequence of identical elements does not make the array non-beautiful (e.g., an array like `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`), the program will incorrectly output `1` instead of the correct answer `1` in this case.

The problem is that the program does not account for the possibility that the array might have multiple sequences of identical elements, and the removal of elements from one sequence might not be enough to make the array non-beautiful. The program should consider more complex scenarios where the removal of multiple elements might be necessary.
