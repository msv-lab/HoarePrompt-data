Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `p` is the first element of `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. If `q` is equal to `i + 1` (which is 1), then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
