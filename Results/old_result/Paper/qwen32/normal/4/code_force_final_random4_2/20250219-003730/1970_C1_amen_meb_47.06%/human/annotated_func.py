#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game.

    while True:
        nums = input().split()

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game. `numbers` is a list containing all the pairs of integers read before the loop breaks.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list `numbers` containing all the pairs of integers (u, v) that represent the edges of the tree. Each pair (u, v) satisfies 1 <= u, v <= n, and there are exactly n-1 such pairs since the tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input representing the edges of a tree with `n` nodes and returns a list of these edges. Each edge is represented as a pair of integers `(u, v)` where `1 <= u, v <= n`. The function stops reading input when a line does not contain exactly two integers.
