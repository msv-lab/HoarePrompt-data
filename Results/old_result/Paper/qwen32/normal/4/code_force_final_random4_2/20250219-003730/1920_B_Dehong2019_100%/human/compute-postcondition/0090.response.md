To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze how the loop modifies `ans1` and `ans2` over `k` iterations.

### Analysis of the Loop:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `i` is initialized to `2x + k - 2`.
   - `ans1` is initialized to `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2])`.
   - `ans2` is initialized to `ans1`.
   - `_` is incremented by `x` (though `_` is not used in the loop, its state is mentioned for completeness).

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - The loop runs `k` times.
   - In each iteration `i` ranges from `0` to `k-1`.
   - `ans1` is updated by adding `a[i]`.
   - If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is further updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]`.
   - `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value.

### Final Output State:

Given that the loop runs `k` times, the final state of `ans1` will be:
- `ans1` is initially `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2])`.
- In each iteration, `ans1` is incremented by `a[i]` and decremented by `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`.

Thus, after `k` iterations, `ans1` will be:
\[ \text{ans1} = \text{sum}(a) - 2 \times \left(\sum_{j=x+k-1}^{2x+k-2} a[j]\right) + \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a[i] - 2 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a[i + x] \]

`ans2` will be the maximum value of `ans1` across all iterations.

### Output State:

Output State: **ans1 = sum(a) - 2 * (sum(a[x+k-1:2x+k-1]) - sum(a[0:k]) + sum(a[x:x+k])), ans2 = max(ans1 across all iterations)**

In simpler terms, after all iterations:
- `ans1` is adjusted by adding the first `k` elements of `a` and subtracting twice the next `k` elements of `a` starting from index `x`.
- `ans2` holds the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the iterations.

This is the final state of the variables `ans1` and `ans2` after the loop has completed all `k` iterations.
