The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0**
