The code snippet adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given the initial state, `temp` initially contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or it is an empty set otherwise. After the code execution, `temp` will definitely contain `(q + r) % n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing at least one more element besides `x`, `r` is the integer value returned by `int(func_1().split()[0])`, `c` is the value returned by `func_1().split()[1]`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` is a set containing `(q + r) % n`.**
This means that regardless of the initial state of `temp` (whether it was empty or contained `(q - r) % n`), after the code execution, `temp` will include `(q + r) % n`.
