The `pop()` method removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a[-1]` is 0, this element will be removed. Therefore, the list `a` will no longer have its last element as 0, and its length will be reduced by 1. The precondition that `a` is not empty still holds because removing the last element from a non-empty list will still leave a list that is not empty, unless the list had only one element (0 in this case), which would make it empty after the pop operation. However, since the problem states that `a` is not empty, we assume `a` has more than one element.

Output State: **`a` is not empty and does not end with 0.**
