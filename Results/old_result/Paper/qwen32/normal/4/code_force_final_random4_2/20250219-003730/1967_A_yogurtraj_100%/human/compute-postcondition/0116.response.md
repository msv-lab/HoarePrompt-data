The code snippet assigns the value of `k % (i + 1)` to the variable `rem`. This calculation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ii`, `i`, or `r`. The only change is the introduction of the new variable `rem` with the calculated value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input, `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**
