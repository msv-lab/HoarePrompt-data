You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires us to simulate the Kraken's attacks on a sequence of ships, where the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship until either all ships have sunk or the given number of attacks have been made. The task is to determine how many ships have sunk after the Kraken's attacks.

The given program does not correctly simulate the sequence of attacks as described in the problem statement. Instead, it attempts to determine the number of ships that would sink if the Kraken attacked the ships in a way that the sum of the durability of the first `a` ships (where `a = ceil(k/2)`) and the sum of the durability of the last `b` ships (where `b = k//2`) were less than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively. This approach does not accurately simulate the alternating attack pattern.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:
1. The program calculates `a` and `b` as `ceil(k/2)` and `k//2`, respectively, which does not correspond to the number of attacks on the first and last ships, respectively.
2. The program sums the durability of ships from the start and end until the cumulative sum exceeds `a` and `b`. This does not simulate the alternating attack pattern.
3. The program does not account for the fact that ships sink when their durability reaches 0 and are no longer attacked.
4. The program does not correctly handle the case where the Kraken attacks more times than the total durability of all ships.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate the alternating attack pattern, decrementing the durability of the first and last ships until they sink or the Kraken has made `k` attacks. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = 0
    ships = deque(nums)
    while k > 0 and ships:
        if ships[0] > 0:
            ships[0] -= 1
            if ships[0] == 0:
                ans += 1
                ships.popleft()
        k -= 1
        if k > 0 and ships:
            if ships[-1] > 0:
                ships[-1] -= 1
                if ships[-1] == 0:
                    ans += 1
                    ships.pop()
            k -= 1
    print(ans)
```

Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
