Postcondition: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is still greater than 0, `x` and `ans` are sets containing at least one value, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]`. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
