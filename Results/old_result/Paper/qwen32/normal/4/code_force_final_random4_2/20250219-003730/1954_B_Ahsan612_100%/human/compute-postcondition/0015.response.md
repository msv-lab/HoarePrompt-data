Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num` and 2 otherwise. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 2; otherwise, `same` is 1 and `num` is updated to `ar[2]` while `minn` is set to 1.**
