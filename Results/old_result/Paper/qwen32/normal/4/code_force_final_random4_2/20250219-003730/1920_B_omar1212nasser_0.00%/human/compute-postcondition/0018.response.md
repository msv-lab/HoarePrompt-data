The code `pos.append(s - 2 * n)` appends a new element to the list `pos`. Given the initial state, `pos` already has an element `s - 2 * n`. After the code execution, `pos` will have one more element, which is also `s - 2 * n`.

Therefore, the updated `pos` will contain two elements, both equal to `s - 2 * n`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` is 2, `s` is `s - elements[-2] - elements[-2]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` has elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, `i` is 2.**
