The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `coord`. The initial state of the variables `t` and `n` is not changed by this code. The variables `l` and `s` are mentioned to not be retained after the loop ends, but since there is no loop in the provided code, their state is irrelevant to the current snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list.**
