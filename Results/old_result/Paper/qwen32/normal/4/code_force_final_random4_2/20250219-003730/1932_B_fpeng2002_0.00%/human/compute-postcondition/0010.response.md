The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range `len(nums)`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is `k + 1`
- The loop iterates over `x` in the range from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` must be incremented by 1.
- The range `len(nums)` remains the same.

Given that `x` was `k + 1` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be `k + 2`.

The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, `start_year`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `(((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`, `x` is `k + 2`**
