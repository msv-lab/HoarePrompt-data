The code appends the result of `x[-1] ^ i` to the list `x`. Given that `x[-1]` is `i` (since the last element of `x` is `[0, i]`), and `^` is the bitwise XOR operator, the new value being appended is `i ^ i`, which is `0`.

Therefore, the list `x` will now be `[0, i, 0]`.

Other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `inds`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must have at least one element, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, i, 0]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]` and `inds[i]` is `[1]`, `i` is the second element of `a`**.
