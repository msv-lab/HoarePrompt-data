Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers provided by the input, and the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd; `x` is the integer value of (a + b + c) // 2; `y` is the integer value of `a + b`.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the integer value of `a + b`. All other variables retain their previously described states and values.
