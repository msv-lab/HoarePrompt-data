Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.'; `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `s` is 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input string that must have at least one character. The character at index `j` in `b` is '*'. The string `b` is non-empty. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
