Output State: **`N` must be greater than 2, `M1` and `M2` are integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 3`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `N - 1`. The current value of `i` is equal to the value of `L[cur]`.**  
The value of `cur` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `M1 - 3`. All other variables retain their previous values.
