The code snippet provided is:

```
t = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. After executing this line, the value of `t` will be updated to the integer input provided by the user, while the preconditions for `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided by the user, where 1 <= `t` <= 500; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 2 <= `k` <= 100; `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `c_i` <= 100 for each i in the range 1 to `n`.**
