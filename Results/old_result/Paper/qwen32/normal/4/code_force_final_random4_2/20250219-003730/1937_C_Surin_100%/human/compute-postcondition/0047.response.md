To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations.
- `i` is 2.
- `prev` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it has not been defined or its value is unknown from the given information.

### Analysis:
- The variable `v1` is described as the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations. Since there is no information about the iterations or the variable `r`, we can only conclude that `v1` is a value that was determined based on some previous logic in the code. However, since no specific value is given for `v1`, we will represent it as `v1`.
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- The variable `prev` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. We will represent it as `prev`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

### Output:
Given the information, the output will be:
Output: **? v1 2 v1 prev (where v1 is the largest i for which r was '<' during the iterations and prev is the value of prev)**

This output reflects the values of the variables as described in the initial state, with `v1` and `prev` left as placeholders for their actual values, which are not provided.
