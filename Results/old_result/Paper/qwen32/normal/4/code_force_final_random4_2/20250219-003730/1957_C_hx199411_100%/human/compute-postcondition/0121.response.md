The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `m + 1`.

Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 5. Additionally, `m` must be at least 4, since `i` needs to be less than `m + 1` (i.e., 5 < m + 1, which means m must be at least 4).

State: **`t` is truthy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros with `dp[1]` set to `1`, `dp[2]` set to `3`, `dp[3]` set to `7`, and `dp[4]` set to `25`, `i` is 5**
