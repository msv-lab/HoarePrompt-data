The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `N`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` must be greater than 3, but we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `N` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, we need to make sure that `i` is not equal to `N` yet. If `i` is equal to `N - 1`, the loop will execute one more time because `i` will be less than `N` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`N` must be greater than 3, and `i` must be less than `N - 1`**
