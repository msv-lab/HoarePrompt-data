Output State: **`num_tests` is 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `num_tests` will be 0 because the loop decrements `num_tests` by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `start_year`, and `x`) will reflect the state of the last test case processed, but `num_tests` itself will be 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process.
