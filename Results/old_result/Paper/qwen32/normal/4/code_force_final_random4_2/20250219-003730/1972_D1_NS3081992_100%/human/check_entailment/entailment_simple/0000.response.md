### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the key parts of the program and see how it addresses the problem requirements.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_10()` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - `func_7()` is used to read the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

2. **Main Function:**
   - `func_16()` is the main function that orchestrates the reading of test cases and the computation of the number of valid pairs for each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_15()` to compute the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - `func_15()` implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - It iterates over possible values of `i` (which is used to derive `b` as `i`) and checks the condition for each pair `(a, b)`.
   - The formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` is used to count the number of valid `a` values for each `b = i`.

4. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are printed to the standard output.

### Analysis of the Solution:

- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - The formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` is used to count the number of valid `a` values for each `b = i`. This formula is derived from the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
  - When `b = i`, the condition simplifies to `a + i` being a multiple of `i * gcd(a, i)`. Since `gcd(a, i)` divides `i`, the condition further simplifies to `a + i` being a multiple of `i * i`.
  - The number of such `a` values in the range `[1, n]` is given by `(n + i) // (i * i)`.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program efficiently counts the number of valid pairs by iterating over possible values of `i` up to `sqrt(n + i)`. This is because if `i > sqrt(n + i)`, then `(n + i) // (i * i)` would be zero, and there would be no valid `a` values.
  - The overall complexity is manageable given the constraints (up to `2 * 10^6` for `n` and `m`), and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^6`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for each test case. The formula used is correct, and the program is efficient given the problem constraints.

**Correctness: True**
