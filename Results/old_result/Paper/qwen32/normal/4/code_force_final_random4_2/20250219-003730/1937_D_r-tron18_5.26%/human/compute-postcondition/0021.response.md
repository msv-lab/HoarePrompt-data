The code snippet `totalOne -= 1` decrements the value of `totalOne` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`, which represents the positions of all '>' characters in the string `s1`. After executing the code, `totalOne` will be reduced by 1.

The other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `suffZero`, `n`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `ans[i]`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre` minus 1; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed; `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0`; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is '>'; `ol` is `totalOne` plus 1; `zr` is `-1`; `ans[i]` is updated based on the conditions provided; `zeroInd` is `0` if `ol` > `zr`, otherwise it is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is `2 - x` if `ol` > `zr`, otherwise it is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `0` if `ol` > `zr`.**
