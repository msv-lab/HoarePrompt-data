You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of signs and their respective periodicities. For each test case, it calculates and prints the smallest year in which all signs will simultaneously display a specific event based on their periodicities.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires us to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that:
1. The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
2. The signs must occur sequentially. That is, after the i-th sign occurs, the tribe starts waiting for the (i+1)-th sign from the year following the occurrence of the i-th sign.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps for each test case:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0, representing the year before the first sign can occur.
4. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
   - Adding 1 to `start_year` to ensure we are starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.
   - Dividing by the periodicity `nums[x]` and adding 1 to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.
5. It prints the final `start_year` after processing all signs.

### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`
   - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - Third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - Sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the expected result)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`
   - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2` (incorrect, should be 1)
     - The program logic is flawed here. It should be `start_year = ((start_year) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` rather than `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` to correctly find the next occurrence.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is incorrect for the second test case and likely for others as well.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the year of the n-th sign's occurrence due to an incorrect formula for determining the next occurrence year.
