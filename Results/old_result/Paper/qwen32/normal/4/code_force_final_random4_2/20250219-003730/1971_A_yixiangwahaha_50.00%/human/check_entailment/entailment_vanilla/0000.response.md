Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum and maximum of two integers for each of a given number of test cases. However, there are several issues with the code that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. The program assumes there are always 10 test cases by iterating 10 times in the for loops, which is not correct. The number of test cases `t` is provided as input and can vary between 1 and 100.
2. The program does not use the value of `t` to control the number of iterations in the for loops. Instead, it hardcoded the loop to run 10 times, which will cause errors if there are fewer than 10 test cases or will not process all test cases if there are more than 10.
3. The print statement includes an extra space after the minimum value, which is not required according to the output format specified in the problem description.

To correct the program, the number of iterations in the for loops should be determined by the value of `t`, and the print statement should be adjusted to match the required output format.

Correctness: **False**
