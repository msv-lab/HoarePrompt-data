The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value, and it must still be less than `n`.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `i + 1` (from the previous value of `i`).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is `i` if `arr[i]` equals `k`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `i` is `i + 1`**
