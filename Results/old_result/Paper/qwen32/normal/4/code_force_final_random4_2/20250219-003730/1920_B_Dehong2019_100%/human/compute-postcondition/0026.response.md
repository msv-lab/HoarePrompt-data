The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `x + 1`, so `ans1` will be increased by the value at index `x + 1` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)` where `ans2` has been updated to the maximum of its previous value and `ans1`, `ans1` is `ans1 + a[x + 1]`**.
