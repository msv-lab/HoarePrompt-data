### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to determine the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
- The cost to travel to the closest city is always 1 coin.
- The cost to travel directly to any other city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

#### Program Breakdown:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The coordinates are converted to integers.

2. **Determine Closest Cities:**
   - `func_1` is used to determine for each city (except the first and last) whether the closest city is the one immediately after it or the one immediately before it.
   - If the closest city is the one immediately after, it records `1` in the result list; otherwise, it records the absolute difference between the city and the closest city before it.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward lists of closest city distances.
   - `pref_sum_f` stores the cumulative cost to travel from the first city to each city using the closest city strategy.
   - `pref_sum_b` does the same but in reverse order.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the cost to travel from city `a` to city `b` using the precomputed prefix sums.
   - If `a < b`, it uses `pref_sum_f`.
   - If `a > b`, it uses `pref_sum_b`.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function correctly identifies whether the closest city to the current city is the one immediately after it or the one immediately before it, and records the appropriate cost.
- However, the function does not handle the case where the closest city is the one immediately after it correctly in the context of the problem. It should always return `1` if the closest city is the one immediately after it, but it returns the distance instead.

#### Correctness:
- The prefix sums are calculated based on incorrect values from `func_1`, which means the costs for traveling between cities are not computed correctly.
- The program does not handle the case where the closest city is the one immediately after it correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly compute the cost to travel to the closest city when it is the one immediately after the current city.

**Correctness: False**
