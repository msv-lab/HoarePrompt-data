Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation such that after performing binary search, the element at the final `l` index is equal to `x`. We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

### Binary Search Process Recap
The binary search process in the problem is:
1. Initialize `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`.
2. Repeat until `r - l = 1`:
   - Compute `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`.
   - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
   - Otherwise, set `r = m`.
3. At the end, `p[l]` should be equal to `x`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program consists of three functions:
- `func_1`: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
- `func_2`: Reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
- `func_3`: Handles each test case by:
  - Reading the permutation length `n` and the target value `k`.
  - Reading the permutation array.
  - Finding the position `pos` of the target value `k` in the array.
  - Performing a binary search to find the position `low` where the binary search would end.
  - If `p[low]` is equal to `k`, no swaps are needed (`print(0)`).
  - Otherwise, it swaps the element at `low` with the element at `pos` (`print(1)` followed by the indices).

### Correctness Check
The program's approach is flawed for the following reasons:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The program performs binary search but does not correctly implement the binary search logic to ensure `p[l]` ends up being `x`. The binary search should be able to correctly identify the position of `x` after at most two swaps.
2. **Handling of Swap Operations**: The program only considers one swap operation in the worst case scenario, which might not be sufficient to guarantee that `p[l]` is `x` after the binary search completes.

### Counterexample
Consider the test case:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
The program might output:
```
1
2 3
```
However, after this swap, the array becomes `[4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]`, and the binary search will still not end with `p[l]` being `3`.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not guarantee that `p[l]` will be `x` after performing at most 2 swaps and running the binary search. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
