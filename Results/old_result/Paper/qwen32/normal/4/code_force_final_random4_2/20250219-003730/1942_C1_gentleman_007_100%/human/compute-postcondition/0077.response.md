Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]`. `i` is `len(a) - 3` or `len(a) - 4` and `j` is `len(b) - 4` or `len(b) - 3`. `l` is either a list containing `a[i]` or a list containing both `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.**

In natural language: The list `l` now contains `a[i]` appended to it. The values of `dp`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
