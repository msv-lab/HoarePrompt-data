The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `mid`. If `i` is less than `mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value that is less than `mid`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Let's summarize the state adjustments:
- `i` is incremented by 1.

All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, `not_mid`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`, `cliquess[left + i]`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), and `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i`. `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
