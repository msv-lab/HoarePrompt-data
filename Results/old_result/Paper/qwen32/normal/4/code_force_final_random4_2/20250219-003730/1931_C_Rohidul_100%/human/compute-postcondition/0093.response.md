Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is the list of integers.
- `le` is the length of the list `a` (which is the same as `n`).
- `l` is `n - 2`.
- `r` is `n - 2`.
- `st` is `n - 1`.
- `end` is `n - (n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `3`.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element, `ans` is 0.
- Otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `le`, `st`, and `end`:**
   - `le` is the length of the list `a`, which is `n`.
   - `st` is `n - 1`.
   - `end` is `3`.

2. **Determine `max(st, end)`:**
   - Since `st` is `n - 1` and `end` is `3`, `max(st, end)` will be `n - 1` if `n > 3`, otherwise, it will be `3`.

3. **Calculate `ans`:**
   - If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element, `ans` is `0`.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`.

### Final Output:
- If `a[0] == a[n-1]`, `ans` is `0`.
- If `a[0] != a[n-1]`:
  - If `n > 3`, `ans` is `n - (n - 1) = 1`.
  - If `n <= 3`, `ans` is `n - 3`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will output `0` if the first and last elements of the list `a` are the same. Otherwise, it will output `1` if the length of the list `a` is greater than 3, or `n - 3` if the length of the list `a` is 3 or less.

Output: **0 if the first and last elements of the list `a` are the same, otherwise 1 if the length of the list `a` is greater than 3, or `n - 3` if the length of the list `a` is 3 or less**.
