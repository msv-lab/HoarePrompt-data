Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not always produce the correct maximum number of draws. Let's analyze the logic and identify the issues:

1. **Sum of Scores Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of scores is even, as an odd total score is impossible with the given scoring system.
2. **Handling `p3 >= p1 + p2`**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program outputs `p1 + p2`. This is correct because it means all games played could be between the player with `p3` and the other two, and the maximum number of draws would be the sum of the other two players' scores.
3. **Finding Maximum Draws for Other Cases**: The logic for finding the maximum number of draws in the other cases is flawed. The loop and conditions do not correctly determine the maximum number of draws.

Here's a more detailed explanation of the flaw:
- The loop and conditions attempt to find a valid distribution of wins and draws, but they do not correctly account for all possible scenarios.
- The program does not handle the scenario where the scores can be achieved with a combination of wins and draws that does not fit the simple pattern checked.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - p3
        
        # Check if the calculated max_draws is feasible
        if max_draws >= 0 and p3 <= p1 + p2 and p2 - max_draws >= 0 and p1 - max_draws >= 0:
            print(max_draws)
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the maximum number of draws and checks if the resulting scores are feasible. It ensures that the calculated number of draws does not lead to negative scores for any player and respects the constraints given in the problem.
