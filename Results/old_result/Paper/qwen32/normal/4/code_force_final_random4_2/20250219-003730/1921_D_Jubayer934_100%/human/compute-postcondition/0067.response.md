The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The other variables (`t`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` remains the index `i` where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is first met, or -1 if never met; `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n - 1` if `temp` is not -1, otherwise `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`; `a` remains the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` remains the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` will have reached `n` after the loop completes.**
