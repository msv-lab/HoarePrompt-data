Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree, and a single integer `u_1` representing the starting node of the game. The function returns a list of all the pairs of integers `(u, v)` that represent the edges of the tree.**
