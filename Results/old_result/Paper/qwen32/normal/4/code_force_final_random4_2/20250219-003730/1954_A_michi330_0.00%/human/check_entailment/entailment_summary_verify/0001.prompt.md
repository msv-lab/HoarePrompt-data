You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to repaint up to `k` parts of a ribbon consisting of `n` parts using `m` colors, under the condition that not all parts are repainted and the number of parts that cannot be repainted is less than `k`. It prints "YES" if the condition is met, otherwise "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, we need to analyze the problem based on the given constraints.

1. **Single Part (n = 1):**
   - If the ribbon has only one part (n = 1), Alice's painting doesn't matter because Bob can always repaint this single part to any color he wants. Therefore, the answer is always "NO".

2. **Single Color (m = 1):**
   - If there is only one color available (m = 1), Alice has no choice but to paint all parts the same color. Bob can then repaint at most k parts (which is at least one part since k >= 1) to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is always "NO".

3. **General Case:**
   - If there are multiple parts and multiple colors, Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no single color can be used to repaint all parts within the limit of k repainting actions by Bob.
   - The key idea is to see if it's possible for Bob to repaint k parts to match the majority color. If the majority color (after Alice paints) has a count of parts greater than n - k, Bob can repaint the other parts to match this majority color. Hence, Alice should avoid such a scenario.
   - To prevent Bob from making all parts the same color, Alice can try to distribute the colors as evenly as possible. The maximum number of parts that can have the same color, if distributed evenly, is `math.ceil(n / m)`.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means Bob can repaint the remaining parts to match the majority color, making it possible for him to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is "NO".
   - Otherwise, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no color appears more than `math.ceil(n / m)` times, making it impossible for Bob to repaint all parts to the same color with k repainting actions. Therefore, the answer is "YES".

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if `n <= k` (which covers the case where Bob can repaint all parts) or if `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` (which covers the case where Bob can repaint enough parts to match the majority color).
- If either condition is true, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
