The provided code snippet initializes a variable `container` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`). The values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`. Additionally, `total_water` is divisible by `n`. `target` is equal to `total_water // n`. `container` is 0.**
