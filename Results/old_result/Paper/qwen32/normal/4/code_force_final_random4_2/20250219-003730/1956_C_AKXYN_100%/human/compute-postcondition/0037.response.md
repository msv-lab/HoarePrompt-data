The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the loop starts with `i` initialized to `n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n-1` (assuming `n` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`**
