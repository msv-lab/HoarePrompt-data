The code snippet `s = [0] + s` modifies the list `s` by prepending a `0` to its current elements. This means that the original sorted list `s` containing all unique elements from `arr` will now have `0` as its first element.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr`.

After executing `s = [0] + s`:
- `s` is now a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by the original elements of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`.**
