The code snippet initializes a variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` or the list `a`. Therefore, the only change is that `res` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `res` is 0.**
