The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. This operation changes the values of `c` and `r` based on the input provided. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `dp`, `i`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `i + 1` (where `i` was `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `m + 1` at the end of the previous iteration), `c` is the first integer from the new input split, `r` is the second integer from the new input split, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, otherwise `num` is 2.**
