The only variable in the loop head is `itest`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `itest` and `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `itest` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `itest` is 0, and `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For the loop to execute one more time, `itest` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. If the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true, then the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed. The values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged regardless of which part is executed.**
