Postcondition: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `i + k` (where `i` was `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `m + 1` at the start of the loop), `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the number of times `c == r` and `c != r` occurred in the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` equals 0.**
