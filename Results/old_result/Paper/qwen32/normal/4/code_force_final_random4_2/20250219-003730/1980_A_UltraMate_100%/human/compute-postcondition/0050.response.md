Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is an input string that must contain at least one character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of characters in `s` and must have at least one key. If `hmp[i] < m` for the current `i` being considered, `ans` is `8 * m - hmp[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `7 * m`.**
