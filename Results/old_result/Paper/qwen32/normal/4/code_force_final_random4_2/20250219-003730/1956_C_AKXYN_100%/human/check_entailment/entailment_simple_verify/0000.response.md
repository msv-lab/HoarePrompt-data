Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in an n x n matrix using no more than 2n operations.
2. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1**: Assign a row `i` with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
   - **Type 2**: Assign a column `i` with a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
3. **Max Sum**: The maximum sum is the sum of the first `n^2` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{n^2(n^2 + 1)}{2}\).

### Program Analysis

The program provided attempts to achieve the maximum sum and outputs the operations required. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   ```python
   mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
   ```
   This initializes the matrix with the first row as `[1, 2, ..., n]`, the second row as `[1, 2, ..., n]`, and so on. This is not the optimal initialization.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   res = 0
   for i in range(n):
       res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   The sum `res` is calculated using the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\). This formula does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct sum should be \(\frac{n^2(n^2 + 1)}{2}\).

3. **Operations Output**:
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   The program outputs `2n` operations, where each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` in reverse order. This does not guarantee the maximum sum because it does not ensure that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once in each row and column.

### Annotations

The annotations correctly describe the state of the program:
- The matrix `mat` is initialized with the same permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row.
- The sum `res` is calculated using the incorrect formula.
- The operations are printed in the specified format but do not achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not generate the correct sequence of operations to achieve this sum. The sum calculation and the operations are incorrect.

**Final Evaluation:**
Final: **False**
