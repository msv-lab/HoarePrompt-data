The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `not_mid - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `not_mid - 2` (since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration).

Given this, we need to adjust `i` to `not_mid - 2` for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\), `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid + not_mid - 1\), `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for \(i = 0\) to `not_mid - 2`, `arr[right]` is `1 + \text{left} + (\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2`, `i` is `not_mid - 2`, `cliquess[right]` is `clique`**
