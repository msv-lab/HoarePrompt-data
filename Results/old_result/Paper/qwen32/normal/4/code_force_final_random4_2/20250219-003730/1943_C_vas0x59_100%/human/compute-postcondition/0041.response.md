The code snippet appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `n` and the contents of `path_ba` will change, but the other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`) will remain the same.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b`, `n`, `previous[n]`, and now `n` is appended to it. If `n` is -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `n` is `previous[previous[n]]`.**
