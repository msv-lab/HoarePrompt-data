Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `t` is `t`; `n` is `q - 1`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `k`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

In natural language: The values of `M`, `L`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, and `w` remain unchanged. The `cost` variable is updated to include additional terms: `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu` is added to the previous value of `cost`, which was `mu * w`.
