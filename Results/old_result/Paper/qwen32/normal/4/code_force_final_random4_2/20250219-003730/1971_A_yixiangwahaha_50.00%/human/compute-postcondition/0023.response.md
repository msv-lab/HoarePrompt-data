Given the initial state, let's break down the values of the variables involved in the `print` statement.

- `t` is a string representing the input value.
- `x` is a list containing ten integers.
- `y` is a list containing ten integers.
- `i` is 1.
- `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces for the last iteration. However, `xylist` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific output.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
```

Since `i` is 1, the statement will print the elements at index 1 of both `x` and `y` lists, separated by a space.

The exact values of `x[1]` and `y[1]` are not provided, but based on the initial state, we know that `x` and `y` are lists of ten integers each. Therefore, `x[1]` and `y[1]` are the second elements of their respective lists.

Output: **x[1] y[1] (where x[1] is the second element of the x list and y[1] is the second element of the y list)**
