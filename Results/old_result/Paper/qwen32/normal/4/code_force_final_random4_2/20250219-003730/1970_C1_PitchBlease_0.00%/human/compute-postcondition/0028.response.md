Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `queue` is a deque containing the newly added tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `visited` is a set containing all nodes reachable from `start` and includes `unvisited_node` and `neighbor`, `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`.**

In simpler terms, the `queue` now includes a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `neighbor` has been added to the `visited` set. All other variables remain unchanged.
