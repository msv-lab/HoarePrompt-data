Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Alice and Bob are painting a ribbon consisting of `n` parts. Alice can paint each part into one of `m` colors. Bob can then repaint up to `k` parts into a single color. The goal is to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Key Observations

1. **If `n <= k`**: Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. Hence, the answer is `NO`.
2. **If `m = 1`**: Alice can only use one color, so Bob can trivially make all parts the same color. Hence, the answer is `NO`.
3. **If `n > k` and `m > 1`**: Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no single color is present in more than `k` parts. This can be achieved by using the formula `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` to check if it's possible to distribute the colors in a way that Bob cannot repaint all parts to one color.

### Explanation of the Program

The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`. It then checks if `n <= k` or if `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. If either condition is true, it prints `NO`; otherwise, it prints `YES`.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Condition `n <= k`**: This correctly handles the case where Bob can repaint all parts.
- **Condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**: This condition checks if it's possible to distribute the colors such that no color appears more than `k` times. If this condition is true, it means that Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is `NO`. Otherwise, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the answer is `YES`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
