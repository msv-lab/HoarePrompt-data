The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the formula provided. Given the initial state, `i` is 5, so we substitute `i` with 5 in the formula:

`dp[5] = (dp[4] + (5 - 1) * dp[3] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`

Using the given values from the initial state:
- `dp[4]` is 25
- `dp[3]` is 7

Substituting these values in:
`dp[5] = (25 + 4 * 7 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[5] = (25 + 56) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[5] = 81 % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
`dp[5] = 81`

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, `dp[4]` which is 25, and `dp[5]` which is 81, `i` is 5**
