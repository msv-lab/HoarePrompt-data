The only object in the loop head is the variable `neighbor`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `tree[current]`. At the end of the last iteration, `neighbor` was the next element in `tree[current]` that had not yet been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another unprocessed element in `tree[current]` to assign to `neighbor`.

State: **`queue` is not empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor` if it was not already visited, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least two elements, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that has not yet been processed.** 

Since `neighbor` was the last processed element, the next `neighbor` should be the subsequent element in `tree[current]` that has not yet been processed. Therefore, we adjust `neighbor` to be the next unprocessed element in `tree[current]`.

State: **`queue` is not empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, including `neighbor` if it was not already visited, `current` is the first element of the tuple removed from the queue and is a key in `tree` with `tree[current]` having at least two elements, `dist` is the second element of the tuple removed from the queue, `neighbor` is the next unprocessed element in `tree[current]`.**
