The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `y`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `x` and `y`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` was not less than `x`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to `x`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` must be at least 1. If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is increased by 1 and `y` is decreased by 1. `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`**
