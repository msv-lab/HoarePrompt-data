The code snippet provided is:

```python
last_row = ''
```

This line of code explicitly sets the variable `last_row` to an empty string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n`.**
