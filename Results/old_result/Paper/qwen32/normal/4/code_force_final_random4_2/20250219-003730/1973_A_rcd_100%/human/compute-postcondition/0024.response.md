Given the initial state and the code snippet, we know that `y` was initially set to `p3` and `x` is 1. The code snippet `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `y` will be `p3 - 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Now, `x` is 1 and `y` is `p3 - 1`.**
