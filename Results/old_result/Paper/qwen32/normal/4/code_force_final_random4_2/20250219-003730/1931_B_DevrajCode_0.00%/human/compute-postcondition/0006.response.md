In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `water`, which iterates over the elements of the list `a`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, and `container`) are not directly part of the loop head and should not be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Given that `a` is already described as a list of integers of length `n` where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, we can conclude that `a` has at least one element, as `n` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment to `a` is necessary for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is 0**
