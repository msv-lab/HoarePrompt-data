Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to determine whether the given binary grid contains a triangle or a square, based on the specific patterns described for each shape.

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
```

Let's break down the code:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`a`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`).
   - It then reads `n` lines of the grid.

2. **Processing Each Line**:
   - For each line, it checks if there is at least one '1'.
   - If there is, it counts the number of '1's in that line and appends this count to the list `k`.

3. **Determining the Shape**:
   - The program then checks if the first and second counts in `k` are equal.
   - If they are, it prints the list `k`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Shape Detection**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to detect whether the shape is a triangle or a square.
   - The check `if k[0] == k[1]:` is insufficient to determine the shape. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not enough to conclude the shape.

2. **Output**:
   - The program prints the list `k` if the condition is met, which is not the required output. The output should be either "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the shape is an upside-down triangle or a square that does not start from the first row.

### Correctness
Given the above analysis, the provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly identify the shape based on the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**
