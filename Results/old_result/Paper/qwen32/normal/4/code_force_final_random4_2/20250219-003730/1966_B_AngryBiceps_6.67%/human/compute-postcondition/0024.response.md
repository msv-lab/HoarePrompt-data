Given the initial state provided, let's break down the information and determine what will be printed when the `print('YES')` statement executes.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. **n**: An integer.
3. **m**: An integer.
4. **a**: A list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input string.
5. **first_row**: A string containing the first character of each input string concatenated together.
6. **last_row**: A string containing the last character of each input string concatenated together.
7. **i**: Set to `n`.
8. **Additional Conditions**:
   - Either the length of the set of characters in `a[0]` is not equal to 1, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`.
   - Either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

### Analysis:
- The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, or `i`.
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
