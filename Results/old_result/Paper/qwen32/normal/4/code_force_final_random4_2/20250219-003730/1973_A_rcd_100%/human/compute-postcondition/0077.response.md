Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` is non-negative, `x` is 1, `y` is `p3`, and `p1 - x` is greater than `p2 - y`**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their original states and constraints.
