To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it correctly computes the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.

### Analysis of the Program

The program processes each test case individually. For each test case, it receives two integers, \( n \) and \( k \). Here's the reasoning behind the logic used in the program:

1. **If \( k = 1 \)**:
   - Only one diagonal needs to have at least one colored cell. This can be achieved by coloring just one cell, so the output is 1.

2. **If \( k \leq 2n \)**:
   - The grid has \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals sloping from the top-left to the bottom-right and \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals sloping from the top-right to the bottom-left, making a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
   - To cover \( k \) diagonals, the program uses the formula `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This formula works because coloring a cell in the center of the grid can cover up to two diagonals (one from each direction), and for \( k \leq 2n \), this strategy is optimal.

3. **If \( k > 2n \)**:
   - In this case, the program uses the formula `k // 2 + 1`. This formula accounts for the fact that each cell can cover at most two diagonals, and for \( k > 2n \), we need to ensure that we cover the additional diagonals beyond the first \( 2n \) diagonals optimally.

### Verification with Example Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)**
   - \( k \leq 2n \), so the output is `math.ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.
   - This is correct as coloring two cells can cover 4 diagonals.

2. **Test Case 2: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)**
   - \( k \leq 2n \), so the output is `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
   - This is correct as coloring two cells can cover 3 diagonals.

3. **Test Case 3: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)**
   - \( k > 2n \), so the output is `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - This is correct as coloring six cells can cover all 10 diagonals.

4. **Test Case 4: \( n = 3, k = 9 \)**
   - \( k > 2n \), so the output is `9 // 2 + 1 = 5`.
   - This is correct as coloring five cells can cover 9 diagonals.

5. **Test Case 5: \( n = 4, k = 7 \)**
   - \( k > 2n \), so the output is `7 // 2 + 1 = 4`.
   - This is correct as coloring four cells can cover 7 diagonals.

6. **Test Case 6: \( n = 7, k = 11 \)**
   - \( k > 2n \), so the output is `11 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
   - This is correct as coloring six cells can cover 11 diagonals.

7. **Test Case 7: \( n = 2, k = 3 \)**
   - \( k > 2n \), so the output is `3 // 2 + 1 = 2`.
   - This is correct as coloring two cells can cover 3 diagonals.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and verification with the provided test cases, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
