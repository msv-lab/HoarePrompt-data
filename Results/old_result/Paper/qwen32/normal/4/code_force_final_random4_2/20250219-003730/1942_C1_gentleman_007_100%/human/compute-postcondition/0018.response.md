Postcondition: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one more adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1. If `vis[node]` was 0 before the if statement, then `vis[node]` is set to 1 and `node` is added to `q`. Otherwise, `vis[node]` remains unchanged and `q` is not modified. `node` is the next unprocessed adjacent vertex in `graph[ver]`.**
