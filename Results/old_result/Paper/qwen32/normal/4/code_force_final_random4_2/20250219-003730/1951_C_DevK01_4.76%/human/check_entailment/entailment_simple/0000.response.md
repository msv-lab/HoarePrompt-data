Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the ticket prices and then selecting the cheapest days to buy tickets. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly account for the price increases that occur after buying tickets on a particular day.

Here are the main issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program calculates the cost based on a fixed number of tickets `m` to be bought each day, without considering that the number of tickets bought on a day can be less than `m`. The cost calculation formula is incorrect and does not account for the price increase correctly.

2. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets bought does not perfectly divide `k`. It incorrectly calculates the cost for the remaining tickets.

3. **Price Increase Mechanism**: The program does not correctly implement the price increase mechanism. The price increase should be applied to all subsequent days after tickets are bought on a particular day, but the program does not correctly simulate this.

4. **Greedy Approach Misapplication**: The program uses a greedy approach by sorting the prices and buying tickets on the cheapest days first, but it does not correctly account for the price increases, which can change the optimal strategy.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a binary search combined with a greedy strategy to find the minimum cost.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
