Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is a sorted list of four elements `[(sorted_x1, sorted_y1), (sorted_x2, sorted_y2), (sorted_x3, sorted_y3), (sorted_x4, sorted_y4)]`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`; `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`**

In this output state, the variable `p2` is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the fourth and third points in the `coord` list. All other variables retain their initial values.
