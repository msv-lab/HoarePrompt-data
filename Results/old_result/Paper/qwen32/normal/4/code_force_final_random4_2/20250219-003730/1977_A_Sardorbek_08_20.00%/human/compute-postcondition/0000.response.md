The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state describes `t` as an integer between 1 and 100, and each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` between 1 and 100. However, the provided code does not process these `t` lines or the values of `n` and `m`. It only reads one integer input and assigns it to `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100, and each of the following `t` lines still contains two integers `n` and `m` between 1 and 100. Additionally, `a` is assigned the value of the input integer.
