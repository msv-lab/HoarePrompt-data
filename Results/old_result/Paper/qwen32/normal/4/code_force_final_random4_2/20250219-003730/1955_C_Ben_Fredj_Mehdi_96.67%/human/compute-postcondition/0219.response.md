The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is `print('2')`. This statement is printing the string `'2'` directly, regardless of the values of the other variables (`t`, `z`, `a`) mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is described as an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. However, this variable is not used in the `print` statement.
2. **Variable `z`**: It is explicitly set to 2. Again, this variable is not used in the `print` statement.
3. **Variable `a`**: It is described as a list of integers derived from the user's input string split by spaces. This variable is also not used in the `print` statement.
4. **Variables `n` and `k`**: They are mentioned as no longer relevant, so they can be ignored.

The `print` statement `print('2')` explicitly prints the string `'2'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **2**
