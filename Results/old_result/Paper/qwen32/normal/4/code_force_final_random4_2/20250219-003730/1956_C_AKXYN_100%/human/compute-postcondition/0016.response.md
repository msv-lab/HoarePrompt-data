Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State
- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `res` is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `i` is set to 1.

### Code Snippet
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis
1. **Value of `i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. **Formatted String**: `'1 %d' % i` will replace `%d` with the value of `i`, which is 1. So, this part will evaluate to the string `'1 1'`.
3. **Range Function**: `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is not specified in the code snippet, we need to assume a value for `n` based on the context. However, since `n` is mentioned to be greater than 0 and is used in the context of generating a sequence, we can assume a general form for the output.

### Output
Given that `n` is greater than 0, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate numbers from 1 to `n`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we will represent the output in a general form.

- The formatted string `'1 %d' % i` evaluates to `'1 1'`.
- The `*range(1, n + 1)` will expand to the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **1 1 1 2 3 ... n (where n is greater than 0)**

To make it more precise, let's assume `n` is 5 for the sake of an example:
Output: **1 1 1 2 3 4 5**

However, since `n` is not specified, the most precise description is:
Output: **1 1 1 2 3 ... n (where n is greater than 0)**
