Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

Let's analyze the program and the problem description to see if the program meets all the requirements.

The problem description states that Sasha needs to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell. The diagonals include both the main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom-left) and the off-diagonals.

The program provided is as follows:
```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Let's test this program with some cases:

1. **Test Case: \( n = 3, k = 4 \)**
   - Expected Output: 2
   - Program Output: 2
   - Correct

2. **Test Case: \( n = 3, k = 3 \)**
   - Expected Output: 2
   - Program Output: 2
   - Correct

3. **Test Case: \( n = 3, k = 10 \)**
   - Expected Output: 6
   - Program Output: 5
   - Incorrect

For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \), the program outputs 5, but the correct answer is 6. To understand why, let's see the diagonals of a \( 3 \times 3 \) grid:

- Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
- Main diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)
- Off-diagonals (top-left to bottom-right): (1,2), (2,3) and (2,1), (3,2)
- Off-diagonals (top-right to bottom-left): (1,2), (2,1) and (2,3), (3,2)

There are a total of \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \) diagonals. To cover all 10 diagonals, we need to color at least 6 cells. The program's logic fails in this case.

Thus, the program does not handle all cases correctly, and the Correctness is **False**.
