The code snippet modifies the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` to `small_element + i`. Given the initial state, let's determine the new value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`.

- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is initially `(left + 1) + i`

After executing the line `arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i`, the new value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` becomes:

\[ \text{arr[left + mid - i - 1]} = (left + 1) + i \]

This is the same as its initial value, so there is no change to the value of `arr[left + mid - i - 1]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration**.
