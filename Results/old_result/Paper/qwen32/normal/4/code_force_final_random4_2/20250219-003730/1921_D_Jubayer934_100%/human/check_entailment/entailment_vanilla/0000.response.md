Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the maximum possible difference \( D \) between two arrays \( a \) and \( c \) where \( c \) is constructed from a subset of \( m \) integers \( b \). Specifically, we need to maximize \( D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| \).

### Key Observations
1. **Sorting**: To maximize the absolute differences, we should pair the smallest elements of \( a \) with the largest elements of \( b \) and vice versa. This is because the absolute difference between a small number and a large number is maximized.
2. **Subset Selection**: Since \( m \ge n \), we can always select \( n \) elements from \( b \) to form \( c \).

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), the array \( a \), and the array \( b \).
2. **Sorting**: It sorts \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order.
3. **Pairing Strategy**: It iterates through the elements of \( a \) and \( b \) to pair them in a way that maximizes the absolute differences.
4. **Result Calculation**: It calculates the sum of the absolute differences and prints it.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Sorting**: The arrays are sorted correctly as per the strategy.
2. **Pairing Strategy**: The program uses a greedy approach to determine the best pairing:
   - It initially assumes the best pairing is between the smallest and largest elements.
   - It checks if a different pairing (smallest element of \( a \) with the second largest element of \( b \)) would yield a larger difference.
   - If a better pairing is found, it switches to the new pairing strategy for the rest of the elements.
3. **Result Calculation**: The sum of the absolute differences is calculated and printed.

### Correctness Verification
The program correctly implements the strategy for maximizing the differences by sorting and carefully choosing the pairs. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the analysis above.

Correctness: **True**
