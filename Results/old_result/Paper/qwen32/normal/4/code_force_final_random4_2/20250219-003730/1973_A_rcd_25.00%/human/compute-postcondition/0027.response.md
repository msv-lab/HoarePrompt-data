The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`; `low` is `p3 - p2`; `high` is `p3 - p1` and `high` must be at least `cur`; `cur` is `cur + 1`.
