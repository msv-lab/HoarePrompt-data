The variable `s` is assigned the sum of the list `elements`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `removals` is a non-negative integer, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is an empty list, and `s` is the sum of `elements`.

Output State: **`removals` is a non-negative integer, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of `elements`.**
