### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Variable Scope Issues:**
   - The `arr` and `cliquess` lists are defined in `func_1` but used in `make_array`. This will indeed lead to a `NameError` because `make_array` does not have access to these variables unless they are passed as arguments or defined globally. This is a critical issue that must be addressed for the program to run correctly.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values and Cliques:**
   - The problem requires assigning distinct integers \(a_i\) to each vertex and then creating edges between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\). The graph must then be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The provided code does not ensure that the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. The code simply assigns values in a pattern and then groups them into a number of cliques determined by `ceil(n / k)`, without checking the edge condition.

3. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary for `make_array` describes how the function modifies `arr` and `cliquess`. However, it does not address the correctness of the overall logic for assigning values and partitioning into cliques.

4. **Example Check:**
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(k = 3\):
     - The code would output `2 1` for `arr`, `1` for `cliques`, and `1 1` for `cliquess`.
     - This specific output does satisfy the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) for \(i = 1\) and \(j = 2\), but this does not validate the general correctness of the program.

5. **General Case:**
   - The program does not implement a strategy to ensure that the condition \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\) is met for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. The current approach of dividing vertices into `ceil(n / k)` cliques and assigning values in a specific pattern does not guarantee this condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with variable scope and the lack of logic to ensure the edge condition is met within each clique, the provided program is incorrect. The original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate.

**Final: False**
