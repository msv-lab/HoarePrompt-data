The code increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given that `cur` was initially set to the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, after the increment, `cur` will be one more than its initial value. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is `low + 1`.**
