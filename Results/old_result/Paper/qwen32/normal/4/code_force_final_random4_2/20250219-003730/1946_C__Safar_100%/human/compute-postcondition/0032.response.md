To determine what will be printed by the `print(r)` statement, we need to examine the initial state provided. However, in the given task, no initial state or information about the variable `r` is provided. This means we don't have any explicit value or definition for `r`.

Since the value of `r` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `r`.

Output: **r (where r is the value of the variable r)**
