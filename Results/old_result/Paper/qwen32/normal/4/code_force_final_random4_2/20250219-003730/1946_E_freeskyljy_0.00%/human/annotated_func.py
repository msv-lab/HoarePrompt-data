#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of three integers n, m_1, and m_2 (1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. The next line contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1} (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order. The following line contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2} (1 ≤ s_i ≤ n) representing the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if a valid permutation of length `n` exists that satisfies the given conditions of prefix and suffix maximums. It returns 0 if the conditions are not met, and 1 if a valid permutation exists.
