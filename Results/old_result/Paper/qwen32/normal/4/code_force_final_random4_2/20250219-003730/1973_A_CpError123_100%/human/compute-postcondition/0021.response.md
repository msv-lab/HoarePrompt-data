The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since no loop is explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect in this context. Therefore, none of the variables will be affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input, and their sum is odd; `x` is the integer value of (a + b + c) // 2; `y` is the integer value of a + b.**
