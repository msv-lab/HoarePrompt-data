Output State: **`l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` is 0, otherwise `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `ans` is set to 2 if both `a[l]` and `a[r]` are 0, 1 if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` is 0, and 0 if neither `a[l]` nor `a[r]` is 0, `T` remains False, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. All other variables retain their initial state or values derived from the initial conditions.
