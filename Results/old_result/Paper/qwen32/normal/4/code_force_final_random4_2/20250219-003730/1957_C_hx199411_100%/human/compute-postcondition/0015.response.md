The code snippet provided is `num += 2`, which increments the value of `num` by 2. The other variables (`c`, `r`, `i`, and `k`) are not directly affected by this operation. 

Given the initial state:
- `c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input.
- `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

After executing `num += 2`, `num` will have its value increased by 2. The other conditions and values remain the same.

Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r` and then increased by 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` must be greater than the new value of `i`.**
