Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `i` remain unchanged; `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in `s` in the alphabet; `tmp` is an empty string; `ans` is a string consisting of the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times.**

In simpler terms, the variable `ans` is now a string made up of the `k`-th letter of the alphabet (where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26) repeated `cnt` times. All other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
