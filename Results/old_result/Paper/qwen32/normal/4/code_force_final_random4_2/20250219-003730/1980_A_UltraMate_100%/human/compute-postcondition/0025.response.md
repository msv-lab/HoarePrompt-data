The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the keys in the dictionary `hmp`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `i` and how it relates to the keys in `hmp`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current key being processed.
- `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair.
- `i` is the next key in `hmp` at the start of the next iteration.

Since `i` is the next key in `hmp`, we need to identify what the next key would be. However, without knowing the specific keys in `hmp`, we can only say that `i` will be the next key in the iteration order of the dictionary.

State: **`ans` is `k * m + 2m - 2hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`, otherwise `ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]`. `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `i` is the next key in `hmp`.**
