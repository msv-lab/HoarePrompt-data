The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables unless there are assignments or other operations within the skipped part. In this case, no changes are made to any of the variables as a result of the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a new input string, `kq1` is the character at index `i` of `a`, `kq2` is the character at index `i` of `a`, `vt` is 0, `q` is `q + 1`. The characters at index `i` of `a` and `b` are equal.**
