The code snippet provided increments the variable `index` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `index` will be 5. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 5; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data` and must be at least 5; `q` is the integer value of the third element in `data`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[3]` which is `int(data[3])` and `a[5]` which is `int(data[4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[4]` which is 0; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` and `mp[0]` is `[0, 4]`; `i` is 5.**
