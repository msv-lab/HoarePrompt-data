Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. a is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^12. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer provided by the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` is the last element of the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer provided by the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `ii` is incremented by `n - 1` from the previous iteration. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `k` is `k - sum((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for i in range(0, n - 1))` and `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and `r` is `a[n - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration. If `k` is not 0, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n` and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)` if the loop breaks, otherwise 0; `y` is `n - 1 - i` if the loop breaks, otherwise 0. If `k` is 0, then `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and `r` is `a[n - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
