The code snippet appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. The value of `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba`, and `i` is 1. This operation modifies the list `ops` by adding the new tuple.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the vertices from `b` to `a` in the shortest path, starting with `b` and ending with `a`, and the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` along with any previous tuples; `ci` is the integer value of `len(path_ba) // 2`; `c` is the middle vertex of `path_ba`; `i` is 1.**
