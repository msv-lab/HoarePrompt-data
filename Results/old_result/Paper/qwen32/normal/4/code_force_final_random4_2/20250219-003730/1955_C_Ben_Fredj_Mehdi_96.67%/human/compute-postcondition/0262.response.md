Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. `z` is 2. `a` is a list where the first `k // 2` elements and the last `k // 2` elements have been decremented by 1. If `k` is odd, the element at index `g` is further decremented by 1. `g` is incremented by the number of times the element at index `g` became 0. `d` is decremented by the number of times the element at index `d` became 0.**
