Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`; `res` is 0.**

In simple terms, the variable `res` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `mat`) remain unchanged with their initial states.
