Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.', `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1`. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.**
