Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `u2vs`, which is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex (0-indexed), and a parameter `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree. The function returns `None`.**
