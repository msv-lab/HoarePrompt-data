Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 1 (not used in the print statement).
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is 0 (not used in the print statement).
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received (not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `r` is the new user input (not used in the print statement).
- `prev` is `n-1` if `r` is `'>'` and `r2` is `'<'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 0 if `r` is `'='` and `r2` is not `'<'`; `r2` is the new user input if `r` is `'='`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is explicitly defined as `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be a positive integer.
- `prev` is determined based on the conditions involving `r` and `r2`. However, the exact values of `r` and `r2` are not provided, so we can only describe `prev` in terms of these conditions:
  - If `r` is `'>'` and `r2` is `'<'`, then `prev` is `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, if `r` is `'='` and `r2` is not `'<'`, then `prev` is `0`.
  - If `r` is not `'='`, the value of `prev` is not specified in the initial state, but we can assume it remains `0` unless otherwise stated.

Given the conditions, `prev` can either be `n-1` or `0` depending on the inputs `r` and `r2`.

### Output:
The print statement will output `? i i prev prev` where `i` is `n-1` and `prev` is either `n-1` or `0` based on the conditions involving `r` and `r2`.

Output: **? [n-1] [n-1] [prev] [prev] (where prev is n-1 if r is '>' and r2 is '<', otherwise prev is 0 if r is '=' and r2 is not '<')**
