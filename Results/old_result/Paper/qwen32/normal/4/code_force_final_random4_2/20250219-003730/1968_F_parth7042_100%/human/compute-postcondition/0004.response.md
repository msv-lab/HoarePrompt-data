The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, or `index`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `data`, `t`, and `index`, while `results` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
