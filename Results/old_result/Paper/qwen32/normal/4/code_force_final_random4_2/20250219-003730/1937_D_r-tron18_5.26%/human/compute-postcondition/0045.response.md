The given code snippet updates the `ans` list at index `i` with a specific value calculated based on the provided variables. The variables `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `n`, and `fi` are used in the calculation. Let's update the `ans` list at index `i` with the new value.

Given the calculation:
```
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
```

The output state will reflect this change. Here's the updated state:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it contains elements `[0, i + 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`; `i` is `k - 1`; `el` is `s1[i]`.**

In natural language: The `ans` list at index `i` is now updated to the value `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. All other variables retain their previous values.
