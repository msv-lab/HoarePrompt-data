You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` and a set of queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it determines if there exists a subarray `a[l-1:r]` whose XOR is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results based on this condition. After processing all queries for all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze step-by-step how the program addresses the problem statement.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem asks to determine whether a subarray can be divided into two or more parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same. For a subarray to be considered "interesting," we can find a way to split it into segments where the XOR of all values in each segment is equal.

### Program Breakdown
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads input values and processes them to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and the list of queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - It calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) for the array. The prefix XOR at position `i` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to position `i`.
   - A dictionary (`mp`) is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, it means the subarray can be trivially split into any number of parts with XOR `0`.
   - If the XOR is not `0`, it checks if there are indices in `mp[pf[r]]` and `mp[pf[l - 1]]` such that a valid split can be made. Specifically, it checks if there is an index in `mp[pf[r]]` that is greater than or equal to `l` and an index in `mp[pf[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.

### Correctness Analysis
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array (`pf`) is correctly calculated and stored.
   - The dictionary (`mp`) is correctly populated with indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` is correctly calculated using the prefix XOR values.
   - The logic for handling the case when the XOR is `0` is correct.
   - The logic for handling the case when the XOR is not `0` is based on the idea of finding valid indices in the dictionary. However, the condition `(v1[it1] < v2[it2])` is not sufficient to ensure that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR. It needs to ensure that there is a way to partition the subarray such that the XOR of each part is equal to `x/k` for some integer `k > 1`. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle all cases for determining whether a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR. Specifically, the condition used to determine if a valid split exists is not sufficient. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Reasoning: The program uses a condition that is not sufficient to determine if a subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR. It does not ensure that the subarray can be partitioned such that the XOR of each part is equal to `x/k` for some integer `k > 1`.
Correctness: **False**
