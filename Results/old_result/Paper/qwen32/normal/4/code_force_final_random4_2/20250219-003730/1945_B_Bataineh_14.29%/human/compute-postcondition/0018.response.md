Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is equal to `t` (the loop has completed all iterations); no further values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are read from the input as the loop has finished executing.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = t-1`), the loop variable `i` will be equal to `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. No new values for `a`, `b`, and `m` will be read from the input, and the initial value of `t` remains unchanged.
