Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, and `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`. If `a[l]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` is incremented by 1; if `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
