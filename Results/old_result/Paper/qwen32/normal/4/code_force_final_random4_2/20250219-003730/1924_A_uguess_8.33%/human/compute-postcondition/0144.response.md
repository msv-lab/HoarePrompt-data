The code snippet `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns the character at position `i` in the alphabet to the variable `tmp`. The other variables remain unchanged. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 in the initial state, `tmp` will now hold the character corresponding to the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k` must be greater than 0; `m`, `s`, `cur`, `cnt` remain unchanged; `cur_ss` is the position of the last character in `s` in the alphabet. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, `tmp` is the character at position `i` in the alphabet. Otherwise, `tmp` remains an empty string. `ans` is a string consisting of the character at position `k-1` in the alphabet repeated `cnt` times, `i` is `i + 1`; `tmp` is the character at position `i` in the alphabet.**
