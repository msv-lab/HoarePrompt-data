Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always correctly implement the solution to the problem. Here are the main issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in the program is not correctly handling the requirement that after the binary search, `p_l` should be equal to `x`. The program checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `x` and if not, it performs a single swap. However, the binary search logic might not correctly place `x` at the correct position after the swaps.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The program performs at most one swap if the initial binary search does not find `x` at the correct position. However, the problem guarantees that at most two swaps are sufficient to achieve the desired result, and the program does not account for cases where two swaps are necessary.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is the smallest or largest element in the permutation, or when `x` is already in the correct position after the initial binary search.

To solve the problem correctly, the program needs to ensure that after performing at most two swaps, the binary search will correctly identify `x` at the position `l`. This involves a more strategic approach to choosing the indices for the swaps based on the current state of the permutation and the target value `x`.
