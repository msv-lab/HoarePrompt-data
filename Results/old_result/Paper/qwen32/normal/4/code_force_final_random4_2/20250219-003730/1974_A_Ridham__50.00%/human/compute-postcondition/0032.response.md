Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing one element, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `remaining_cells` is recalculated based on the formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
