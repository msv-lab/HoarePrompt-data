To determine the output of the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of `low` and `pos`.

### Analysis:

1. **`n` and `k`**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `1 <= k <= n`.

2. **`arr`**:
   - `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`. The exact contents of `arr` are not specified, but we know it is a list of some kind.

3. **`pos`**:
   - `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - If no such `i` exists, `pos` remains `-1`.

4. **`low`**:
   - `low` is the index where the final `mid` was found or the closest index to `k` if `k` is not in `arr`.
   - Given that `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, `low` points to the closest index where `k` would fit in a sorted `arr`.

5. **`high`**:
   - `high` is defined as `low + 1`.

6. **`st`**:
   - `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the loop.

### Determining `low + 1` and `pos + 1`:

- **`low + 1`**:
  - Since `low` is the index where the final `mid` was found or the closest index to `k` if `k` is not in `arr`, `low + 1` will be the next index after `low`.

- **`pos + 1`**:
  - Since `pos` is `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos + 1` will be `0`.
  - If `pos` were to be a valid index where `arr[pos] == k`, `pos + 1` would be the next index after `pos`.

### Conclusion:

Given that `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it implies that `k` is not present in `arr`. As a result, `pos` remains `-1`. Therefore, the output will be:

- `low + 1`: The next index after the closest index to `k`.
- `pos + 1`: `0`, since `pos` is `-1`.

Since the exact value of `low` is not specified, we describe it in terms of its role as the closest index to `k` in `arr`.

### Final Output:

Output: **low + 1, 0 (where low is the index where the final mid was found or the closest index to k if k is not in arr)**
