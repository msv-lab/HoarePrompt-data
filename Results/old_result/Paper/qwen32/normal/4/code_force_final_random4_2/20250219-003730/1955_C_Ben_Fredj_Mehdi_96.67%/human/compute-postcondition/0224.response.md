The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'8'`. This string is explicitly provided within the `print` function and does not depend on any of the variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`) mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `z`, `a`), but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print('8')` statement directly outputs the string `'8'`.

Since the output is explicitly given and does not change based on any input or variable values, the output is straightforward.

Output: **8**
