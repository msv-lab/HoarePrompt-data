The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `x` retains its value as an input integer.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
