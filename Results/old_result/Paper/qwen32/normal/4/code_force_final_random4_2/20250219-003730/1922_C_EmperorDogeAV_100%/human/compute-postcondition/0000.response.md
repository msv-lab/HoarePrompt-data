The provided code initializes a list `prog_cities` with `n - 1` zeros. This means that the length of `prog_cities` is one less than the number of cities `n`.

Given the initial state, the list `cities` and the integer `n` are already defined. The code does not affect `cities` or `n`. It only creates a new list `prog_cities` with `n - 1` zeros.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities, and the second element is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.**
