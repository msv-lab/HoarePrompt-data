Reasoning:  
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. The program is supposed to perform at most 2 swaps on the permutation to ensure that after applying the binary search algorithm, the element at index `l` is equal to `x`. 

However, the provided code does not perform any swaps. Instead, it only checks if the element at index `l` after the binary search is equal to `x`. If they are not equal, it suggests swapping the element at index `l` with the element equal to `x`. But this swap is not actually performed in the list, and the program does not handle the case where more than one swap might be necessary.

The binary search part of the program is implemented correctly, but the logic for ensuring that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search is flawed. The program should perform the necessary swaps on the array before performing the binary search, not just suggest them.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
