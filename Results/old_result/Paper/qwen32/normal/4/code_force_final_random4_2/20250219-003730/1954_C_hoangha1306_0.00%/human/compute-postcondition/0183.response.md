Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` that have the same number of digits and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. It then constructs and prints two new integers `kq1` and `kq2` based on the comparison of corresponding digits of `x` and `y`. If the digits are the same, they are added to both `kq1` and `kq2`. If the digits differ, the smaller digit is added to `kq1` and the larger digit is added to `kq2` for the first mismatch, and thereafter, the larger digit is added to `kq1` and the smaller digit is added to `kq2`.**
