Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]` for all `i` from 0 to `len(a)` and `j` from 0 to `len(b)`. The final value `dp[len(a)][len(b)]` contains the length of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`. `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, and `l` is a list containing the characters of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b` in reverse order.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `i` and `j` will both be `0`, indicating that we have traced back to the start of the strings `a` and `b`. The list `l` will contain the characters of the longest common subsequence between `a` and `b`, but in reverse order, because we are appending characters to `l` as we move backward through the `dp` table.
