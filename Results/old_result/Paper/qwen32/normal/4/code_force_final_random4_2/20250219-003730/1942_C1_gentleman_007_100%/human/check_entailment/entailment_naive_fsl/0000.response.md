Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not contain any logic to solve the given problem. The code consists of several utility functions (func_1 through func_25) that perform various operations such as reading input, computing greatest common divisors, generating prime numbers, and more. However, none of these functions are related to the problem of finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with given vertices.

The problem requires implementing a solution that calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the given vertices of a polygon. The provided code does not include any logic to achieve this, and thus it is incorrect for the given problem description.

To solve the problem correctly, we would need to implement a function that takes the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the list of chosen vertices, and then calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed. The provided code does not do this, and hence it is incorrect.
