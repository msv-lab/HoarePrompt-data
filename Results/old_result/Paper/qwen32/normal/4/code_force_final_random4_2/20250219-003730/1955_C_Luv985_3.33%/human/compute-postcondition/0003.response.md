Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `T` has been decremented by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`) remain unchanged. The precondition for `T` is updated to reflect that it is now one less than its initial value, but it still satisfies the condition 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.
