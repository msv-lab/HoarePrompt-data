Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero; `l` is not equal to `r`; `k` is positive; `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

In simple terms: The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and the condition that `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are not both zero remain unchanged. A new variable `mi` is introduced, which holds the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
