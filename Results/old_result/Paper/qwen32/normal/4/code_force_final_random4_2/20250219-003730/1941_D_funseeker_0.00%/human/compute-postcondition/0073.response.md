The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the value 0 from the set `ans` if it exists. Given that the initial state specifies that `ans` contains the value 0, this value will be removed, resulting in an empty set for `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is 0, `x` is unchanged, and `ans` is an empty set.**
