The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `max_item_idx`. The values of `n`, `ans`, and the condition `2 <= n <= 10^4` remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `max_item_idx` is `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is `i`, `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, i, i)`, and `ans` equals '<'**.
