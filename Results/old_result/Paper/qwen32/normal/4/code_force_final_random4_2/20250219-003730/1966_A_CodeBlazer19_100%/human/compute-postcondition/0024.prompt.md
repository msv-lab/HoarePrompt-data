Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer input provided by the user, where 1 <= `t` <= 500; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 2 <= `k` <= 100; `c` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= `c_i` <= 100 for each i in the range 1 to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
    if max(p) >= k:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        print(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is not adjusted before the loop starts, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the maximum value in `p` is indeed greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the maximum value in `p` is less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `l` is a new list of integers from the input, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. The if-else block does not alter any of these variables based on the condition `max(p) >= k`; it simply ensures that the postconditions of both the if and else parts are met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input, `l` is a new list of integers from the input, `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`. If the maximum value in `p` is greater than or equal to `k`, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
