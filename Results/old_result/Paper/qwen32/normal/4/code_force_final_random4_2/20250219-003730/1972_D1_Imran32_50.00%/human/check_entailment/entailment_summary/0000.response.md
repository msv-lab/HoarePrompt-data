Reasoning:

The provided program does not seem to correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

However, the given program does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and adds to it the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from `2` to the square root of `n` rounded up. This formula does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

The program also uses `k` instead of `m` in the input, which is inconsistent with the problem statement. The variable `m` from the problem statement is not used at all in the provided code.

Since the program does not implement the correct algorithm to solve the problem, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
