Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the smallest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, `tp1` is `tp1 + 1`**.

In natural language: The value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
