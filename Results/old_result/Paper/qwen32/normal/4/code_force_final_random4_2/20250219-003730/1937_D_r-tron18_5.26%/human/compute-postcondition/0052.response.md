To determine the output state, we need to focus on how the given line of code affects the variables. The line of code is:

```python
oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
```

This line updates the value of `oneInd` to be twice the result of the function `func_1` called with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `oneInd` is calculated based on the conditions provided.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

After the execution of the line, `oneInd` is updated, but all other variables retain their previous values unless they are directly or indirectly affected by the change in `oneInd`. Since there is no indication that any other variables depend on `oneInd` in the given code snippet, we can assume that only `oneInd` is updated.

Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the previous elements plus the new element which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`; `fi` is `0` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>'; if `el` is not '>', `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; `i` is `k - 1`; `el` is `s1[i]`.**
