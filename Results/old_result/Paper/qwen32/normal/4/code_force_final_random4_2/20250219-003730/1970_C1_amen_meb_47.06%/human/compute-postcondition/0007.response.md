Since the code provided is `num2 = int(nums[1])`, it implies that the list `nums` must have at least two elements before this line can execute without causing an index error. However, according to the initial state, `nums` is a list containing only one element, which is the string representation of `u_1`. Therefore, the condition that the length of `nums` is not 2 must be met, and the most internal loop or if statement should be broken out of before reaching this line. 

Given this, the code `num2 = int(nums[1])` should not be executed as per the initial state provided. However, for the sake of adhering to the task instructions and assuming that the condition was somehow bypassed, we will proceed with the calculation.

If we hypothetically proceed, `nums[1]` would not exist, and an `IndexError` would be raised. But, for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume the list `nums` somehow contains a second element before this line is executed, which is not in accordance with the initial state provided.

Since the task requires us to provide an output state even in this hypothetical scenario, let's assume `nums` hypothetically contains a second element that is the string representation of some integer `v_1`.

Hypothetical Output State (assuming `nums` hypothetically has a second element):
- `num2` would be assigned the integer value of `nums[1]`.

However, since this contradicts the initial state provided, the correct interpretation is that the code does not execute due to the length condition, and the output state remains as per the initial state with no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game. `numbers` is an empty list. `nums` is a list containing the string representation of `u_1`. `num1` is the integer value of `u_1`. If the length of `nums` is not 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute.**
