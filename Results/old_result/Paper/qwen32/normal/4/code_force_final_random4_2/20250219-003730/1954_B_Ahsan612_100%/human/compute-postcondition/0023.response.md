Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 2 otherwise, and `i` remains 2. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[3]`, and `i` is updated to 3.**
