Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1`. `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`. `i` is `N - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `N` must be greater than 2, `M1` and `M2` are integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M1` is greater than 1. `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` if `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, otherwise `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. `cur` is `M1 - 3` if `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 3`. `i` is `N - 2`. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `N` must be greater than 3, `M1` and `M2` are integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M1` is greater than 1. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` and `cur` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. `cur` is `M1 - 4` if `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 3`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`. `i` is `N - 3`. If `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `N` must be greater than 4, `M1` and `M2` are integers obtained from the input, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, at least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `M1` is greater than 1, `cur` is `M1 - 5` if `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 4`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`, `i` is `N - 4`, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` and is further updated based on conditions.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
