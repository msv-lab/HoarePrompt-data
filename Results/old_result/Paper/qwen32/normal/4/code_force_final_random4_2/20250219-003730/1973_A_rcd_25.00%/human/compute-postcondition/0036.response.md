To determine the output of the print statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- The if-else block does not affect the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` since the condition `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` is always true.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Explanation:
The print statement will output the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Since the exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables. The only constraint we have is that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\) and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

### Output:
The output will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which are integers satisfying the given constraints.
Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30 and p1 + p2 + p3 is odd)**
