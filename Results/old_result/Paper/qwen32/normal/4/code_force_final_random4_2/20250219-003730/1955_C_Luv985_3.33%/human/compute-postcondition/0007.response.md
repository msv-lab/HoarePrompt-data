The code provided reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. These strings are not yet converted to integers, so the list `a` will contain string representations of the integers that were originally in `a`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of n strings where each string is the string representation of an integer a_i that satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
