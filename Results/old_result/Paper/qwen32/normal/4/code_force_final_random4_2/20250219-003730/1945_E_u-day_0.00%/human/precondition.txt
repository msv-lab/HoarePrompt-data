The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n), where n is the length of the permutation and x is the number to be found. The next line contains a permutation p of n distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
