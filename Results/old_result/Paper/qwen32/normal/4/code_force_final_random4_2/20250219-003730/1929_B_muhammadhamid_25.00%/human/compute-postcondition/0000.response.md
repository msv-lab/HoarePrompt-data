In the given task, the loop is controlled by the variable `_` in the loop head, which is used to iterate over the range of `int(input())`. The loop will execute for each test case provided by the input. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly part of the loop head but are mentioned as part of the input that will be read inside the loop body.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the input such that `int(input())` returns a value greater than or equal to 1 (since the loop will iterate `int(input())` times). The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are mentioned to describe what the input will be like inside the loop, but they do not need to be adjusted in the state before the loop starts because they will be read from the input during each iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input to ensure that it provides at least one test case.

State: **The input must provide an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases.**
