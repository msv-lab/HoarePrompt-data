Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`, `num` is `a[i+1]`. If `num` is not in `count`, `res` is either 2, 3, or 1, and `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 1, 2, or 0 based on its previous value and the condition `num not in count`, and `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**
