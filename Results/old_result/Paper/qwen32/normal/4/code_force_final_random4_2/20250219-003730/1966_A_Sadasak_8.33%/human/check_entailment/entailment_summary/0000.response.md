### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the frequency of each card number and then applying the given operations to minimize the number of cards. However, the logic implemented in the program is not correct for solving the problem.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Frequency Calculation and Capping**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the frequency of each card number and caps the frequency at `k`. However, this frequency capping does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing operations.

2. **Decision Making**: The main logic in the program is flawed:
   - If `k > n`, it correctly prints `n` because no operations can be performed.
   - If `k == n`, it correctly prints `k - 1` because one card can be removed by exchanging all `k` cards.
   - For other cases, the program checks if `k` is in the frequency values and prints `k - 1` if true, otherwise it prints `n`. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal way to reduce the number of cards.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy to solve the problem is to repeatedly exchange `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards until no more such exchanges can be made. The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of the remainders when each frequency is divided by `k`.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
