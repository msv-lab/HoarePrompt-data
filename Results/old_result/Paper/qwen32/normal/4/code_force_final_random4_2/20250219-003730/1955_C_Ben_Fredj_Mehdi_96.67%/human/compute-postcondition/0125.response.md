The code snippet assigns the value of the substring of `a` starting just after the first space character to the variable `k`, converting this substring into an integer. The variables `t`, `z`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is now the integer value of the substring of `a` from the first space character to the end.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a string obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` from the first space character to the end.**
