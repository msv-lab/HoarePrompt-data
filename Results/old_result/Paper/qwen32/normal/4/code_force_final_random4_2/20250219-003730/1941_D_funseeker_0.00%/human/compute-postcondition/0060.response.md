The code snippet adds a new element to the set `temp`, which is `(q + r) % n`. This means that the set `temp` now contains the element `(q + r) % n` in addition to any elements it previously contained. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains at least two elements, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string). If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and now also contains `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` contains `(q + r) % n`. `q` is the next element in `ans`.**
