You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing scores of players sorted in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints either -1 if the sum of the scores is odd, or the minimum of half the total sum of the scores and the sum of the two lower scores.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Total Points Constraint**: The total points across all players must be even. This is because every game results in a total of 2 points being awarded (either 2 to the winner, or 1 to each player in case of a draw).
2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the total points and the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores. This is because draws can only occur between the players, and the points of the two lower-scoring players would be maximized if all their games were draws.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the scores of the three players.
2. **Total Points Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. If it isn't, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have a valid set of games that results in an odd total score.
3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `x` as half of the total points, which represents the maximum possible number of games played (since each game contributes 2 points).
   - The program calculates `y` as the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores (`a + b`).
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y`, which is the maximum possible number of draws.

### Validation Against Test Cases:
Let's validate the program against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
   - Total points: 0 (even)
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`
   - Output: `0` (correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
   - Total points: 2 (even)
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - Output: `1` (correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
   - Total points: 3 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
   - Total points: 4 (even)
   - `x = 2`, `y = 2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
   - Total points: 9 (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (correct)

6. **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - `x = 6`, `y = 7`
   - Output: `6` (correct)

7. **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
   - Total points: 12 (even)
   - `x = 6`, `y = 2`
   - Output: `2` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and adheres to the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly checks for the even total points and calculates the maximum number of draws based on the provided scores.
