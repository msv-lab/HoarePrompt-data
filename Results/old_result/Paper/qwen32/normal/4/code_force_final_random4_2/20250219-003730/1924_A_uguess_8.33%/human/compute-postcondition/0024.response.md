The code snippet `cur += 1 << cur_ss` modifies the value of `cur` by performing a bitwise left shift operation on `1` by `cur_ss` positions and then adding the result to `cur`.

Given the initial state, `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet, ranging from 0 to 25. The operation `1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary representation of `1` to the left by `cur_ss` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{cur\_ss}\).

Therefore, the new value of `cur` will be the sum of its previous value and \(2^{cur\_ss}\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'); `cur` is the previous value of `cur` plus \(2^{cur\_ss}\).**
