The value of `k` is reassigned to `j + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a value, `e` is a value, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Output State: **`k` is `j + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` is a value, `e` is a value, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**
