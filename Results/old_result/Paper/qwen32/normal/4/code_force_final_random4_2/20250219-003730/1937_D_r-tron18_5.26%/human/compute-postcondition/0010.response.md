Given the initial state and the code snippet, the task is to determine the output state after the execution of the code.

Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `el` is `s1[i]` which is '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `-1`.
- The condition `ol <= zr` is true, meaning `totalOne` is less than or equal to `-1`.

Code Snippet:
```python
zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
```

Given the condition `ol <= zr` is true, and `zr` is `-1`, `ol` must be `-1` or less. However, as `ol` represents `totalOne`, which is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, it cannot be negative. Therefore, the condition `ol <= zr` being true implies an impossible scenario in the context of the problem, as `totalOne` (count of '>') cannot be less than or equal to `-1`.

Assuming the condition is hypothetically true for the sake of this exercise, the code will still execute as follows:

- `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is called with `suffZero` being `[0]` and `ol` being `-1` (hypothetically).
- The result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is multiplied by `2` and assigned to `zeroInd`.

Since the behavior of `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `zeroInd`. However, we can state that `zeroInd` will be twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `-1`; `zeroInd` is twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`**.
