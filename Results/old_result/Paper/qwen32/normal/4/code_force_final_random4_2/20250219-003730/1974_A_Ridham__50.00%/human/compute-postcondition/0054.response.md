The code snippet appends a value to the `result` list. The value being appended is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`. Given the initial state, we need to update the `result` list to include this new value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even or `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, `result` is a list containing three elements, the third element being `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x % 15 == 0` or `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `space_x % 15 != 0`.**

In simpler terms, the `result` list now has three elements, with the third element being the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables retain their initial values.
