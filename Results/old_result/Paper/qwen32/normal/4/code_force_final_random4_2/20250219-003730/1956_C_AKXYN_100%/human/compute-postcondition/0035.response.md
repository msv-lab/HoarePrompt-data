To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break it down step by step.

### Code Analysis
The code snippet is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Variables and Initial State
- `n` must be greater than 0 (given precondition).
- `i` is not defined in the initial state provided, so we need to assume it has some value. Since it is used in a string formatting operation, we can infer that `i` is expected to be an integer.

### Code Execution
1. **String Formatting**: `'1 %d' % i`:
   - This part of the code is formatting a string where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The value of `i` will replace `%d` in the string.
   - Since the value of `i` is not provided, we will represent the output as `'1 [i]'` where `[i]` is the value of `i`.

2. **Range Function**: `*range(1, n + 1)`:
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function.
   - Therefore, `*range(1, n + 1)` will print numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Combining the Outputs
- The `print` function combines the formatted string `'1 %d' % i` with the unpacked range of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- The final output will be the string `'1 [i]'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Final Output
Given the above analysis, the output of the code snippet can be described as:
Output: **1 [i] 1 2 3 ... n (where [i] is the value of i and n is an integer greater than 0)**

Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we represent it as `[i]`. The sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` is included as specified.
