Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is the first element of `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. The current value of `q` is equal to `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
