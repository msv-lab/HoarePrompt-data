The `print('YES')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. The statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement contains a literal string `'YES'`, which means it will output this exact string regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **YES**
