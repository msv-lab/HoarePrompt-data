Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and x are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= x <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. a is a list of integers of length n such that 1 <= a_i <= 1000 for each i from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is a comment block and does not contain any executable Python code. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
