You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
The problem involves a coding tournament with `n` cows, each having a unique Cowdeforces rating. The cows are initially positioned in a line, and they compete in a series of `n-1` matches. In each match, the cow with the higher rating wins and advances to the next match. You can swap your cow (initially at position `k`) with another cow exactly once (or not swap at all) to maximize the number of matches your cow wins.

### Program Analysis
The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x = a[k]`: The rating of your cow.
   - `ind = []`: A list to store indices of cows with higher ratings than your cow.
   - `c = 0`: A counter for the number of cows with higher ratings found.

2. **Finding Higher-Rated Cows**:
   - The program iterates through the list of cow ratings (`a`).
   - If a cow has a higher rating than your cow (`a[i] > x`), its index is added to `ind`, and `c` is incremented.
   - The loop stops once two higher-rated cows are found (`c == 2`).

3. **Calculating Maximum Wins**:
   - If no higher-rated cows are found (`ind == []`), your cow can win all matches (`n - 1`).
   - If only one higher-rated cow is found:
     - If this cow is at position 0, your cow can win all matches up to its position (`k - 1`).
     - If this cow is at a position greater than `k`, your cow can win all matches up to this cow's position (`ind[0] - 1`).
     - Otherwise, your cow can win matches up to either the position of the higher-rated cow or the position before the higher-rated cow, whichever is greater (`max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)`).
   - If two higher-rated cows are found:
     - If the first higher-rated cow is at position 0, your cow can win matches up to the second higher-rated cow's position or up to its own position, whichever is smaller (`min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)`).
     - If your cow's position is greater than the second higher-rated cow's position, your cow can win matches up to either the first higher-rated cow's position or the matches between the two higher-rated cows, whichever is greater (`max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])`).
     - Otherwise, your cow can win matches up to either the first higher-rated cow's position or the matches between your cow and the first higher-rated cow, whichever is greater (`max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])`).

### Issues in the Program
The program has several issues:
- `n` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`, leading to a `NameError`.
- The logic for determining the maximum number of wins is incorrect in several cases, particularly when there are more than two higher-rated cows or when the higher-rated cows are positioned in specific ways.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
