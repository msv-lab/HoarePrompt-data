To determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - x + p3)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order. This means `p1 <= p2 <= p3`.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is non-negative.
- `x` is either 0 or 1.
- `y` is at least `x` (though `y` is not used in the print statement, so it's irrelevant for this particular output).

Given these conditions, we can break down the expression `p1 - x + p3`:

1. **`p1`**: This is the smallest score among `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
2. **`x`**: This can be either 0 or 1.
3. **`p3`**: This is the largest score among `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

The expression `p1 - x + p3` can take two possible forms based on the value of `x`:
- If `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to `p1 + p3`.
- If `x` is 1, the expression simplifies to `p1 - 1 + p3`.

Since the exact values of `p1` and `p3` are not specified, we can describe the output in terms of these variables and the possible values of `x`.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 is the smallest score, p3 is the largest score, and x is either 0 or 1)**
