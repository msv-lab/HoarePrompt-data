Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`, `res` is 0, and `count` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num not in count:
        count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
        res += 1
    else:
        count[num] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`. If `num` was not in `count`, then `res` is 1 and `count` is a dictionary with one entry `{num ^ (1 << 31) - 1: 1}`. Otherwise, `res` is 0 and the value associated with the key `num` in `count` has been decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`, `res` is either 1, 2, or 0 depending on its previous value and the condition `num not in count`. If `num` was not in `count`, `count` is updated with the count of the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` incremented by 1. If `num` was in `count`, the value associated with the key `num` in `count` is decremented by 1. `num` is `a[i]` where `i` is the index of the next element to be processed in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`, `num` is `a[i+1]`. If `num` is not in `count`, `res` is either 2, 3, or 1, and `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 1, 2, or 0 based on its previous value and the condition `num not in count`, and `count[num]` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
