Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` must be less than `len(a) - 1`; `counter` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `counter` is initialized to 1. The values of `a` and `j` remain as per the initial state, with `j` still being incremented by 1 and still required to be less than `len(a) - 1`.
