Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it's correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem is to determine if, after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes. Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube from the tower. We need to consider the following points:

1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Possible Moves**: Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube in each move.
3. **Final State**: After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Parity (Even/Odd)**: The number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves depends on the parity of `n` and `m`:
   - If `n` is odd, the final number of cubes (`m`) must be odd.
   - If `n` is even, the final number of cubes (`m`) must be even.
2. **Range of Possible Values**: The final number of cubes `m` can be in the range `[0, n]` because each move changes the number of cubes by 1.

### Correct Conditions:
- If `n >= m` and `n % 2 == m % 2`, then it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Otherwise, it is not possible.

### Program Analysis:
Let's analyze the provided code:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)  # This line does nothing and can be removed
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Condition for `b < c`**: The condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect. The number of moves `n` (`b`) can be less than the number of cubes `m` (`c`), but what matters is the parity and the range.
2. **Parity Check**: The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` is correct for checking if the final number of cubes `m` can be achieved after `n` moves, provided `n >= m`.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: The output should be case-insensitive, but the code provides mixed case outputs.

### Corrected Conditions:
- **Correct Condition**: If `b >= c` and `b % 2 == c % 2`, print "Yes" (case-insensitive).
- **Otherwise**: Print "No".

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of the condition `b < c`. The correct condition should be based on the parity and the range of possible values.

Correctness: **False**
