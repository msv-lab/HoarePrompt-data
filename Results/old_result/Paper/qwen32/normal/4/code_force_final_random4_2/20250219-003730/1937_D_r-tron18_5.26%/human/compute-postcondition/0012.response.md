To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state provided:

Initial State:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0.
- `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `el` is `s1[i]` which is '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `-1`.
- `zeroInd` is twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

The line of code to be executed is:
```
ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
```

This line modifies the `ans` list at index `i` by assigning it the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`.

To determine the exact value of `ans[i]`, we need to know the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. Let's break down these values based on the initial state:

- `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we will use the expressions directly in our output state.

The updated `ans` list at index `i` will be `ans[i] = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0; `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol) - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `-1`; `zeroInd` is twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.
