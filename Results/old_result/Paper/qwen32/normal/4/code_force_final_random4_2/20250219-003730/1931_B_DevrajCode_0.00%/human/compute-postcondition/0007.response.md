The code snippet `container += water - target` updates the `container` variable by adding the difference between `water` and `target` to it. Given the initial state, we know the values or conditions of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, and `container`. The value of `water` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we will assume that `water` is a variable that holds a specific integer value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is updated to `container + (water - target)`**.

In simple terms, the `container` variable is now the sum of its previous value and the difference between `water` and `target`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
