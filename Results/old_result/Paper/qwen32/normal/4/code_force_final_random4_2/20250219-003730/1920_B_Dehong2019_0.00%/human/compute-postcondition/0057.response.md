The code snippet provided subtracts `2 * a[i + x]` from `ans1`. Given the initial state, we need to update the value of `ans1` accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code.

Initial State Recap:
- `a` is sorted in descending order.
- `ans1` is initially the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `2 * a[i]` minus `4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `2 * a[i]` minus `2 * a[i]`.
- `ans2` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i]`.
- `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
- `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `x` are assigned the values from the input.
- `i` is `i`.

After the code snippet `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` is executed:
- `ans1` is now the initial value of `ans1` minus `2 * a[i + x]`.

Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `2 * a[i]` minus `6 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `2 * a[i]` minus `4 * a[i]`; `ans2` is the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `4 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise it remains the sum of elements from index `x` to the end of `a` plus `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i]`; `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `i` is `i`.**
