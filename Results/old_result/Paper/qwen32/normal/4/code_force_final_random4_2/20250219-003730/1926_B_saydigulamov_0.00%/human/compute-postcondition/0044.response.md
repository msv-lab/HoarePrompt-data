The code snippet appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` contains the character '1', the count will be a positive integer. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged, and `b` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`, `b` is a string equal to the user's input and contains the character '1'.**
