The variable `r` is assigned an empty string. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `r` is an empty string.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `r` is an empty string.**
