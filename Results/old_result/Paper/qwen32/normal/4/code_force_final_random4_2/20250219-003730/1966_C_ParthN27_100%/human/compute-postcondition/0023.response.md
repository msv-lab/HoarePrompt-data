The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and 1. Given that `ans` is initially 1, the result of this operation will be 0 because 1 XOR 1 equals 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of the list `s` where `n` > 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`, `ans` is 0, and the difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` is 1 or less.**
