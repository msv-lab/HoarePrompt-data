The code provided only modifies the `nums_left` variable by decrementing it by 1. The other variables (`N`, `i`, `R[cur]`, `cur`, `ans`, `MOD`) are not directly altered by this snippet. Therefore, the condition `N` must be greater than 3 remains valid, and the behavior of how `cur` and `ans` are updated based on `i` and `R[cur]` also remains unchanged.

The only change is that `nums_left` is now one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 3. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, `cur` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1.**
