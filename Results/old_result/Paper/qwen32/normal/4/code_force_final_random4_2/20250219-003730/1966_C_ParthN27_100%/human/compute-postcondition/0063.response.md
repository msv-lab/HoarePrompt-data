The code snippet `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and `1`. Given that `ans` is initially `1`, the result of this operation will be `0` because `1 XOR 1` equals `0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 2, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements of `arr` with `0` prepended, `ans` is 0, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less.**
