Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer provided by the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `k` is 0 (since the if condition `k != 0` is false); `ii` is incremented by `n - 1` from the previous iteration; `r` is `a[n - 1]`.**
