### Reasoning:

The program aims to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, using at most `3n` queries. Let's break down the logic of the program to determine if it achieves this goal:

1. **Finding the Largest Element (`max_item_idx`)**:
   - The program iterates over indices from `1` to `n-1` and performs a query of the form `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`.
   - If the result of the query is `'<'`, it means `p_i` is larger than `p_max_item_idx` (since `p_max_item_idx | p_max_item_idx` is compared with `p_i | p_i`), and `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - By the end of this loop, `max_item_idx` should point to the largest element in the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding the Best Pair (`pair_idx`)**:
   - The program then iterates over all indices from `0` to `n-1` and performs a query of the form `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`.
   - If the result of the query is `'<'`, it means `p_i` has a higher OR value with `p_max_item_idx` than `p_pair_idx`, and `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - If the result is `'='`, it means `p_i` has the same OR value with `p_max_item_idx` as `p_pair_idx`. To resolve this, another query `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` is performed. If the result is `'>'`, it means `p_i` is larger than `p_pair_idx`, and `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - By the end of this loop, `pair_idx` should point to an element that, when XORed with `p_max_item_idx`, gives a high XOR value.

3. **Output**:
   - The program then outputs the pair `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

### Analysis:
- The first loop ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the largest element in the permutation, which is a good candidate for maximizing the XOR value.
- The second loop aims to find an element that, when XORed with the largest element, gives a high XOR value. The logic to resolve ties by checking if one element is larger than the other is valid.
- The program uses at most `2n` queries in the worst case (one loop with `n-1` queries and another loop with `n` queries), which is well within the limit of `3n` queries.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic correctly identifies a pair of indices that maximize the bitwise XOR of the permutation elements within the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
