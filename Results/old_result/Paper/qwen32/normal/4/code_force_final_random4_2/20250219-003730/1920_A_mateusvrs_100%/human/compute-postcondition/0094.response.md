Postcondition: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1 and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `i` is the next new value from `cx` that hasn't been iterated over yet. If `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 0.**
