Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the shape in the grid is a "SQUARE" or a "TRIANGLE". The program only checks if the first two rows of 1s have the same number of 1s and then prints the list `k`, which is not the expected output. The program does not handle the logic for checking the entire shape for being a square or a triangle as described in the problem statement. 

Here is a brief outline of what the program should do:

1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the size of the grid `n`.
3. Read the `n` lines of the grid.
4. Determine if the shape formed by the 1s is a square or a triangle.
5. Print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the determined shape.

The current implementation does not check the necessary conditions for the shape to be a square or a triangle, and it does not produce the correct output format.
