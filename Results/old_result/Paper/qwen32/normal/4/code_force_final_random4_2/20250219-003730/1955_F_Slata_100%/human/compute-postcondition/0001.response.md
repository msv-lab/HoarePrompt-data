The code snippet assigns the values returned by `input().split()` to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Given that the input consists of four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, these integers will be directly mapped to `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.**
