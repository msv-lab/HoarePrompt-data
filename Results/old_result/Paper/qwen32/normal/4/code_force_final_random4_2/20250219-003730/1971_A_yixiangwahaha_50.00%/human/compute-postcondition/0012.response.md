The code snippet `xylist = input().split(' ')` will overwrite the previous `xylist` with a new list of strings obtained from splitting the new input by spaces. The variables `t`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a string representing the input value, `x` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[0]`, `y` is a list containing two identical integer values of `xylist[1]`, `i` is 2, `xylist` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input by spaces.**
