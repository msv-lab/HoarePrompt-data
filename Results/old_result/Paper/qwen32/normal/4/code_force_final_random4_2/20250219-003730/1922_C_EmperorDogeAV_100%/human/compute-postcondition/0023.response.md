Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, here's the output state:

The code snippet modifies the `prog_cities` list by setting the `i`-th element to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. The other variables (`cities`, `i`, `back`, `forward`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`; `i` is an index, `back` is the previous city in the list, and `forward` is the next city in the list.**

In simpler terms, the `prog_cities` list at the `i`-th position is now updated to the absolute difference between `forward` and the `i`-th city in the `cities` list, while all other variables retain their previous values.
