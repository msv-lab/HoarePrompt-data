Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`, `res` is either 1, 2, or 0 depending on its previous value and the condition `num not in count`. If `num` was not in `count`, `count` is updated with the count of the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` incremented by 1. If `num` was in `count`, the value associated with the key `num` in `count` is decremented by 1. `num` is `a[i]` where `i` is the index of the next element to be processed in the list `a`.**
