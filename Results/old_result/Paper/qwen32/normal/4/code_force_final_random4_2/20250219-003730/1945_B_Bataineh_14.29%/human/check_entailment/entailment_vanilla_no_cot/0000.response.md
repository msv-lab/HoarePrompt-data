Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program is too simplistic and does not account for the correct overlap of fireworks from both installations.

The current logic states:
- If `m < a` or `m < b`, it prints `2`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the actual overlap of fireworks.
- Otherwise, it prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula does not correctly account for the overlaps and the actual number of fireworks visible at the same time.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time, which involves finding the common multiples of `a` and `b` and considering the visibility period `m`. This is a more complex problem that involves using the least common multiple (LCM) and careful counting of overlaps.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        count_a = m // a + 1
        count_b = m // b + 1
        count_ab = m // l + 1
        max_fireworks = count_a + count_b - count_ab
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by considering the overlaps using the LCM.
