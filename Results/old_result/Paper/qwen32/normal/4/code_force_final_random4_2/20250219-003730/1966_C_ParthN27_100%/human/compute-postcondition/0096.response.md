Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and is equal to 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with a length of 2, `ans` is 1, the number of iterations left is `t-1`.**
