Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, and `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 4 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 3 otherwise, and `i` is 3. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, `same` is 1, and `i` is either 4 or 5; `num` is `ar[4]` if `i` is 4, or `ar[5]` if `i` is 5.**
