The code snippet `s_b += nums[n - i - 1]` modifies the value of `s_b` by adding the element `nums[n - i - 1]` to it. Given the initial state, `s_b` was initially set to `nums[n - 1]`. After the execution of the code, `s_b` becomes `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - i - 1]`.

Here are the variables and their states after the execution of the code:
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `k` remains an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15.
- `nums` remains a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.
- `a` remains `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
- `b` remains `k // 2`.
- `s_a` remains `nums[0] + nums[1]`.
- `s_b` is now `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - i - 1]`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `ans` remains initially set to 1 if `s_a` <= `a` and incremented by 1 if `s_b` <= `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `s_a` is `nums[0] + nums[1]`, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1] + nums[n - i - 1]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is initially set to 1 if `s_a` <= `a` and incremented by 1 if `s_b` <= `b`.**
