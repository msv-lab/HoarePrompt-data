Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers read from the input; `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`. The current value of `b` is equal to the current value of `c`.**
