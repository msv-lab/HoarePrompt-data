The code snippet provided initializes a variable `tmp` with the value `0`. None of the other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, we only update the value of `tmp` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` where `a` is 1, and `cx` is a set containing all `x` where `a` is neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 0.**
