You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. a and b are lists of integers, each of length n, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9.

    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for all i from 0 to k-1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` and `k` (integers where 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000) and two lists `a` and `b` (each of length `n` with integers in the range 1 to 10^9). It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` from index `i` to `n-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the code does not account for the fact that when Kirill swaps positions with person `j`, he also needs to pay `b_k` coins to each person `k` such that `j < k < i`. The current implementation only considers the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each person, which is incorrect.

To illustrate this, let's consider a test case:

**Input:**
```
1
5 3
7 3 6 9 2
4 3 8 5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Kirill starts at position 6 (after the 5th person).
- To get to position 3, he can swap with the person at position 5 (cost `a[4] = 2`).
- No additional `b_k` payments are needed because there are no people between positions 5 and 6.
- Total cost = 2.

However, the provided code will calculate the cost incorrectly. It will consider the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each person and sum up the costs, which does not account for the additional `b_k` payments correctly.

Let's see what the code would output for this test case:

**Code Output:**
```
9
```

**Explanation of Code Output:**
- The code calculates the suffix sum of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each person.
- It then tries to find the minimum cost to move Kirill to one of the first `m` positions.
- However, it does not account for the additional `b_k` payments correctly, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
