To determine the output state, we will calculate the value of `dp[i]` using the given formula and then update the state accordingly.

Given:
- `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`
- `i` is 4
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` can be calculated as `(dp[2] + (2) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7`

Now, we calculate `dp[4]`:
- `dp[4] = (dp[3] + (3) * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (7 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (7 + 18) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 25`

Thus, `dp[4]` is updated to 25.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is at least 3, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1, `dp[2]` which is 3, `dp[3]` which is 7, and `dp[4]` which is 25, `i` is 4**
