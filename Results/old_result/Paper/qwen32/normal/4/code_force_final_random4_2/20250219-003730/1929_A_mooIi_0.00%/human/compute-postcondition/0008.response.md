The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a conventional placeholder for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop iterates based on the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. This means that the loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only state we need to adjust is the input integer that determines the number of iterations. Since the loop has just completed an iteration, the number of remaining iterations should be decreased by 1.

Let's denote the input integer as `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have executed once, so `n` should be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time if possible.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499, `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input, `n` is an input integer decreased by 1**.

Since we don't have a specific value for `n`, we can't provide a concrete number, but we know that `n` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499, `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input, `n` is decreased by 1**.
