The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'200'`. This output is independent of the values of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` as described in the initial state. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'200'`.

Let's break down the initial state and the code:

- `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4.
- `z` is initialized to 1.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the first space character to the end.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'200'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **200**
