You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) representing the scores of the three players sorted in non-decreasing order. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: t is 0, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers representing scores of players sorted in non-decreasing order. For each test case, it calculates and prints either -1 if the sum of the scores is odd, or the minimum of half the total sum of the scores and the sum of the two lower scores.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players.
- The scores are provided in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
- If the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games, we should return -1.

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \).
3. It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints -1 because the total points must be even (each game adds 2 points, so the sum must be even).
4. It calculates \( x = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \) and \( y = a + b \).
5. It prints the minimum of \( x \) and \( y \).

### Correctness Verification
Let's verify if this logic is correct for all possible cases:

1. **Even Sum Check**: The check for the sum of scores being even is correct because each game adds 2 points, so the total points must be even. If the sum is odd, the scores are invalid.

2. **Calculation of Draws**:
   - \( x = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \) represents the total number of games played since each game contributes 2 points.
   - \( y = a + b \) represents the sum of the points of the two players with the lower scores.
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of \( x \) and \( y \) because:
     - Draws contribute 1 point to each player, so the number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games.
     - Draws also cannot exceed the points of the two players with the lower scores because each draw adds 1 point to each player.

### Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases:
- **All Scores Zero**: \( (0, 0, 0) \) -> The sum is even, and the maximum number of draws is 0.
- **One Draw**: \( (0, 1, 1) \) -> The sum is even, and the maximum number of draws is 1.
- **Valid Scores with Draws**: \( (3, 4, 5) \) -> The sum is even, and the maximum number of draws is 6.
- **Invalid Scores**: \( (1, 1, 10) \) -> The sum is odd, so it should return -1.

### Conclusion
The program seems to handle all the cases correctly. It checks for the even sum and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly based on the logic provided.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly handles all the described cases and edge cases, ensuring that the maximum number of draws is calculated accurately and invalid scores are correctly identified.
