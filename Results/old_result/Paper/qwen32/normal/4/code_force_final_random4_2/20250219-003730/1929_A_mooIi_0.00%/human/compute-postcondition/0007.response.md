Let's break down the given information and determine the output step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499.
- `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input.
- `n` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `ar`**: It is described as a map object containing strings of sorted integers. This implies that `ar` is the result of applying a function (likely `str`) to an iterable of sorted integers. For example, if the original iterable was `[1, 2, 3]`, then `ar` would be something like `map(str, [1, 2, 3])`, which would yield the strings `'1'`, `'2'`, and `'3'`.

2. **`' '.join(ar)`**: The `join` method is used to concatenate the elements of `ar` into a single string, with each element separated by a space. Since `ar` contains strings of sorted integers, the result of `' '.join(ar)` will be a string where each integer from the original iterable is converted to a string and separated by a space.

### Example:
If the original iterable was `[1, 2, 3]`, then:
- `ar` would be `map(str, [1, 2, 3])` which yields `'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`.
- `' '.join(ar)` would result in the string `'1 2 3'`.

### General Case:
Since `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers, the output will be a string of these integers joined by spaces.

### Output:
Based on the above analysis, the output will be a string of sorted integers from the input, each converted to a string and separated by a space.

Output: **a string of sorted integers from the input, each converted to a string and separated by a space (where the integers are the elements of the iterable that `ar` was derived from)**
