Reasoning:
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by counting the unique numbers in the list `a` that do not have their bitwise complements also present in `a`. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups required based on the problem's constraints.

The key requirement of the problem is that for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations should not have any matching bits in the 1st to 31st positions. This means that for each bit position from 1 to 31, no two numbers in the same group can have the same value for that bit.

The provided function `func_1` does not address this requirement. Instead, it counts unique numbers and their bitwise complements, which does not ensure that the numbers in the same group have non-matching bits across all positions from 1 to 31.

To correctly solve the problem, a different approach is needed. One possible solution involves using a graph coloring approach or a greedy algorithm to assign numbers to groups based on their bit patterns, ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any of the 1st to 31st positions.

Given the incorrect logic in `func_1`, the program does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
