The code snippet provided affects the variable `res` by adding the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to it. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `mat` is also not affected by this code snippet. The value of `res` is updated based on the value of `i`, which is not defined in the provided initial state, so we will express the new value of `res` in terms of `i`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `res + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`**.
