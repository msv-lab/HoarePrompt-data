The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the existing value of `last_row`. 

Given the initial state, `last_row` is already set to the last character of the last element in `a`. After executing the code, `last_row` will be the concatenation of its current value and the last character of the last element in `a` again. This means `last_row` will effectively be the last character of the last element in `a` repeated twice.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the original input and the newly appended input), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row` and the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` repeated twice, `i` is 1.**
