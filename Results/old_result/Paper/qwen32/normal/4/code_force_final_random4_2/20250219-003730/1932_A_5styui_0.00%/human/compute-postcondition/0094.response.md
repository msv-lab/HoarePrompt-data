Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.', `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a non-empty string, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `j + 1` provided `j + 1 < len(b)`, `s` is 1 if `b[j]` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0, and the loop or if statement is terminated.**

Explanation: The `break` statement terminates the loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `path`, `a`, `d`, `b`, `i`, `j`, or `s`. The values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
