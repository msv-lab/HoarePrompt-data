The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `counter` by 1. The values of `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, and `i` must be less than `n`; `counter` is increased by 1.**
