Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space, `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 1999999998, 1999999999, and it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1). The current value of `n` is 101 and the current value of `k` is 100000000000.**
