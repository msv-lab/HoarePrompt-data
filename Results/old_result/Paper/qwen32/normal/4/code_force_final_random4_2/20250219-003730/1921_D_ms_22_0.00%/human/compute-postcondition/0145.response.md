The given code snippet only modifies the variable `tp2` by decrementing its value by 1. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `tp2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is `ans - item[0]`, `tp2` is `tp2 - 1`.**
