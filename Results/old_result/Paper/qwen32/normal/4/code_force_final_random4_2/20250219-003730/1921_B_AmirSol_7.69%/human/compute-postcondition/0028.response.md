The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged. Since `i` must be less than `n` in the initial state, after incrementing `i`, it will still be less than `n` unless it reaches `n-1` and then increments to `n`, which is not allowed by the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, and `i` is less than `n` after being incremented by 1.**
