The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given the initial state, `res` was either 0 or 1. After the execution of the code, `res` will be 1 or 2 respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list with at least one element, `res` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `i + 1`**.
