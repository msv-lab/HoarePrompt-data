Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, `i` is 3, and the character `d[j]` is present in the substring `e[k:]`. The loop or if statement is broken out of if either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`.**
