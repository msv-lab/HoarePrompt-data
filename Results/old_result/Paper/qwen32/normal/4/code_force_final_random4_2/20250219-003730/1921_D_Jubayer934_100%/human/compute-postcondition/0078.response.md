The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, `i` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is 0 if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at the position `n - i` from the end of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at position `i` in `b`; otherwise, `temp` remains -1, `ans` is a list containing one element `abs(a[0] - b[0])`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is 1**.
