The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value, and we need to determine what `i` should be at the start of the next iteration for the loop to continue executing.

From the problem statement:
- `i` is an integer.
- The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

If `i` is currently `k` (where `k` is the value at the end of the previous iteration), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`, as long as `k + 1` is less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order. `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` if the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, otherwise the `i`-th element is `abs(forward - cities[i])`. `i` is an integer, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise unchanged; `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since the state of `cities` and `prog_cities` does not change in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`.
