The `while` loop condition is `i < n`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `i` is still less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the loop body's logic, `i` is either incremented by 1 or by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, the only variable we need to adjust is `i` to ensure it remains less than `n`. We can adjust `i` to be any value that is less than `n`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, and `i` must be less than `n`**.
