The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, and `b` is the upper limit of the loop.

Given the conditions:
- If `d[j]` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, then `k` is updated to `j + 1`.
- If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the loop is broken out of.
- Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` remains `j` and we break out of the loop.

Since we are only concerned with adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `j` by 1, provided `j` is still less than `b`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user's input; `j` is incremented by 1**.
