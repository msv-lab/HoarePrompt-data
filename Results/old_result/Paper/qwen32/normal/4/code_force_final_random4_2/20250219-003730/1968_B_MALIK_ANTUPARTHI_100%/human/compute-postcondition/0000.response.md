The code snippet `a = int(input())` changes the variable `a` to an integer value obtained from the input. This means `a` is no longer a binary string of length `n` but an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `b`) remain unchanged based on the provided initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer; `b` is a binary string of length `m`.**
