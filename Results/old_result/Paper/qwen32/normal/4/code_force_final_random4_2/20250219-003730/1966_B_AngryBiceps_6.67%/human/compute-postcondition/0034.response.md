The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the `first_row` string. Given that `a` contains one element (the result of `input()`), `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of that element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing one element (the result of `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, `first_row` now holds the first character of the string that was the only element in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
