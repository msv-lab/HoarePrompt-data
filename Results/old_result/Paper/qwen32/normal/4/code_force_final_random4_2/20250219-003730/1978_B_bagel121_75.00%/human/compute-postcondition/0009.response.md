Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is less than `b`.
- `k` is the smaller of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
- `ans` is the sum of the `k` largest elements from the range `[a, b]`.
- `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans + p2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `k`:**
   - `k` is the smaller of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - `b - a + 1` represents the total number of integers in the range `[a, b]`.
   - If `n` is less than `b - a + 1`, then `k = n`; otherwise, `k = b - a + 1`.

2. **Determine the value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the sum of the `k` largest elements from the range `[a, b]`.
   - Since `a < b`, the `k` largest elements are the `k` largest numbers in the sequence from `a` to `b`.
   - If `k = n` and `n < b - a + 1`, the `k` largest elements are the `n` largest numbers from `a` to `b`.
   - If `k = b - a + 1`, the `k` largest elements are all the numbers from `a` to `b`.

3. **Determine the value of `p2`:**
   - `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.
   - This represents the product of the number of elements not included in the `k` largest elements and the smallest element `a`.

4. **Calculate the final output:**
   - The final output is `ans + p2`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the `k` largest elements.
   - `p2` is the product of the number of elements not included in the `k` largest elements and the smallest element `a`.

### Final Output:
The printed value is the sum of the `k` largest elements in the range `[a, b]` plus the product of the number of elements not included in the `k` largest elements and the smallest element `a`.

Output: **ans + p2 (where ans is the sum of the k largest elements from the range [a, b], and p2 is (n - k) * a)**
