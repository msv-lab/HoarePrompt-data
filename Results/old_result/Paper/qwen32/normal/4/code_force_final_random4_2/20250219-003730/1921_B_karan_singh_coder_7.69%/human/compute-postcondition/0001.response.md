`n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is now determined by the input provided. The other variables `t`, `s`, and `f` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` and `f` are strings of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1', and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
