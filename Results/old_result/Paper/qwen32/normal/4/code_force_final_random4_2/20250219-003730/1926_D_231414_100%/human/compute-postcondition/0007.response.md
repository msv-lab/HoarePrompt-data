The code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `check`. The value assigned is `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is a constant value of `2147483647`. This value overwrites the previous value of `check`, which was also `2147483647` according to the initial state. Since this value does not change, the state of `check` remains the same.

None of the other variables (`t`, `times`, `n`, `data`, `dic`, `ans`) are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `times` is greater than or equal to 1, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0.**
