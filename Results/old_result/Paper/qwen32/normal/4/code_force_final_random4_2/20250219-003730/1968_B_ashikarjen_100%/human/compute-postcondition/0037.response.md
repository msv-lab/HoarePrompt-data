The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `j` is 2, so after the operation, `j` becomes 3. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `m`, `b`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user with `b[2] != a[1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**.
