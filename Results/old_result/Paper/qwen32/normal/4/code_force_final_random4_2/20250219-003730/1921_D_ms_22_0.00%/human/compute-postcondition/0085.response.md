The provided code snippet reassigns the values of `n` and `m` based on the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is an integer obtained from the split input. The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` will read a new pair of integers from the input and assign them to `n` and `m`, respectively. Therefore, the values of `n` and `m` will change to whatever the input provides, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is equal to `m` (all elements of `b` have been used from the lower end); `tp2` is -1 (all elements of `b` have been used from the upper end); `ans` is the sum of the minimum distances required to match each element of `a` with elements of `b`.**
