The value of `num` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `ar`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, and `same`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`.**
