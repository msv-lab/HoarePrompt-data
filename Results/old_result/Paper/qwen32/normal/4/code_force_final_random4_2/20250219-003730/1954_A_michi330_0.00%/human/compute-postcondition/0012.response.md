Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`, the if part is executed; otherwise, the else part is executed. In both cases, the values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were read from the input.**
