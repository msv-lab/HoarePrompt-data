Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; if `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `j + 1` if `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, otherwise no changes are made to `k`. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `j`. In both cases, the loop or if statement is terminated; `j` is 4; `k` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
