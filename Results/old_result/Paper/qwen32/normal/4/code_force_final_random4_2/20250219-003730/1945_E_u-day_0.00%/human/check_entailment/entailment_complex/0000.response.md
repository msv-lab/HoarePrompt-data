Reasoning:

The given code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the main points:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_3` is not correctly implemented. The binary search algorithm is designed to find the exact position of a target element in a sorted array. However, in this problem, the array is not sorted, and the task is to manipulate the array in such a way that after performing at most 2 swaps, the binary search can correctly identify the position of the target element `x`.
   - The current implementation performs a binary search on the unsorted array and prints the number of swaps and the indices to swap based on the incorrect assumption that the array will be sorted after the swaps. This is not guaranteed and does not align with the problem requirements.

2. **Incorrect Output for Swaps**:
   - The code prints `0` if `arr[low] == k`. This is correct for that specific case.
   - However, if `arr[low] != k`, the code prints `1` followed by `low + 1, pos + 1`. This is incorrect because `pos` is the index of `k` in the original array, and the goal is to make `arr[low]` equal to `k` after at most 2 swaps. The code does not guarantee that `arr[low]` will be equal to `k` after one swap, and it does not handle the case where `pos` is `-1` (i.e., `k` is not in the array, which is not possible as per the problem statement).

3. **Lack of Proper Swapping Logic**:
   - The code does not actually perform any swaps on the array. It only prints the indices that should be swapped. The problem requires the array to be manipulated before the binary search is performed, but the code does not do this.
   - The code should include logic to swap elements in the array based on the indices it determines, and then perform the binary search on the modified array.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
