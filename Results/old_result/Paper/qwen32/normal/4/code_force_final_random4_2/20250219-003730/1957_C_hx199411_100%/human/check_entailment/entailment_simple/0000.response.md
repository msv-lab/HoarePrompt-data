### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves with constraints on how rooks can be placed. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly follows the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves you made, each consisting of a pair of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Counting Moves and Mirrors:**
   - The program counts `num`, which is the number of moves that are either diagonal (where `r_i == c_i`) or non-diagonal (where `r_i != c_i`).
   - Diagonal moves contribute `1` to `num` because they do not result in a mirror move by the computer.
   - Non-diagonal moves contribute `2` to `num` because they result in a mirror move by the computer.

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves:**
   - The remaining number of moves `m` is calculated as `n - num`. This represents the number of positions left on the board where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, there is only `1` possible configuration because no more moves can be made.
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations:
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place `i` pairs of non-attacking rooks on an `i x i` board.
     - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is derived from considering the placement of the first pair of rooks and the remaining configurations.
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `dp[m]` for each test case.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Correctness of Counting Moves:**
  - The program correctly counts the number of diagonal and non-diagonal moves, which is crucial for determining the number of remaining positions `m`.

- **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
  - The dynamic programming approach is correctly implemented to count the number of configurations for placing `m` pairs of non-attacking rooks on an `m x m` board, which aligns with the problem requirements.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The results are correctly computed modulo `10^9 + 7`, ensuring that the output fits within the required constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as `m == 0` and `m == 1` correctly by outputting `1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It accurately counts the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after the given moves and additional moves, while considering the constraints and edge cases.
