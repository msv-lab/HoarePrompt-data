The code snippet provided assigns a specific value to the variable `ax`. The value assigned is `1000000000.0 + 7`, which is `1000000007`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:

- `t` remains the initial state of the program variables minus 2.
- `r` remains a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, and it may include an additional element based on the comparison between `bx` and `ax`.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `cx` remains an empty set.
- `ax` is now `1000000007`.
- `bx` remains the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1.

Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1.**
