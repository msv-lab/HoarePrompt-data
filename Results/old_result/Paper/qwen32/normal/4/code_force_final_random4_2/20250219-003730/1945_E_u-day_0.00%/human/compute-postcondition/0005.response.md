The code assigns the value of `i` to `pos`. Thus, `pos` is no longer -1 but now holds the value of `i`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged. Since `arr[i]` equals `k`, this condition is still valid. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is `i`, and `arr[i]` equals `k`.**
