### Reasoning:
The program aims to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The program correctly handles the following points:
1. **Odd `n` Case:** If `n` is odd, the program correctly outputs "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in the described pattern.
2. **Even `n` Case:** If `n` is even, the program outputs "YES" and constructs a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters. This string ensures that every character (except the first and last) has exactly one neighbor that is the same, making all `n` characters special.

The execution summary confirms that the program's behavior matches the problem description. For each test case with an even `n`, the program generates a string with `n` special characters by alternating between 'A' and 'B'. For odd `n`, it correctly returns "NO".

Thus, the program is correct based on the given problem description and execution summary.

### Correctness: **True**
