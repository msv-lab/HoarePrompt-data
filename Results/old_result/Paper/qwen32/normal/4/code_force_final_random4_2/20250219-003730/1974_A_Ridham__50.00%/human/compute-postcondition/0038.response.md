The code appends the value of `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` to the `result` list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` and `y` are still integers provided by the input; `n` is still an integer greater than 0; `result` is a list containing two elements, the second element being `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`; `space_x` is still equal to `x`; `space_y` is still equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is still equal to `space_y + space_x`; `remaining_cells` is still equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`; `extra_space` is still equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`; `extra_screen` is still equal to `space_x // 15` if `space_x % 15 == 0`, otherwise `extra_screen` is still equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`; `screen_require_for_y` is still equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is still equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**

In simple terms: The `result` list now has an additional element which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables retain their initial values.
