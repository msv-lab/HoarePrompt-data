Postcondition: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` must be greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer and `a` is not equal to 1, `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the element `x`.**
