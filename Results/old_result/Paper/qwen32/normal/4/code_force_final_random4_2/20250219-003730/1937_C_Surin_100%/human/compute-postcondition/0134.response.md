Let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `r` is the new user input.
- `r2` is the new user input if `r` is `'='`.
- If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is `n-1`.
- If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is `n-1`.
- Otherwise, if `r` is not `'='` or `r2` is not `'<'`, `prev` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is set to `n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` is also greater than 1.
- **`prev`**: The value of `prev` depends on the value of `r` and `r2`:
  - If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `n-1`.
  - If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `prev` remains 0.
- Since the exact values of `r` and `r2` are not specified, we need to consider all possibilities:
  - If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` will be `n-1`.
  - If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` will be `n-1`.
  - If `r` is neither `'>'` nor `'='` or `r2` is not `'<'` when `r` is `'='`, `prev` will be 0.

### Output:
Given the possible values of `prev`, we can describe the output in terms of these conditions.

- If `r` is `'>'` or `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` will be `n-1`.
- Otherwise, `prev` will be 0.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **? [n] [n] [prev] [prev] (where [n] is the value of n and [prev] is n-1 if r is '>' or r is '=' and r2 is '<', otherwise [prev] is 0)**
