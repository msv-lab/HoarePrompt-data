The value of `v2` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `v2` will also be `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the user input. If `r` is equal to `<`, `prev` is the final value updated based on the responses `r` and `r2`. If `r` is not equal to `<`, `prev` remains unchanged.**
