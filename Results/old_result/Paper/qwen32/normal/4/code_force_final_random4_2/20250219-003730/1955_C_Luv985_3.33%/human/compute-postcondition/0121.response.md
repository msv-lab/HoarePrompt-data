Output State: **`l` is 1 and `r` is at least 2, or `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 1, and `k` is greater than 0; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is decreased by twice the minimum value (`mi`) between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, while `a[l]` and `a[r]` are each reduced by `mi`. The conditions on `l`, `r`, and `k` remain the same.
