Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `s_a` is `nums[0]`, `s_b` is `nums[n - 1]`, `i` is 0, `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
