The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the variable `j`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is a list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `p` is the first element of `l`; `q` is the element at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. The current value of `q` is equal to `i + 1`.**
