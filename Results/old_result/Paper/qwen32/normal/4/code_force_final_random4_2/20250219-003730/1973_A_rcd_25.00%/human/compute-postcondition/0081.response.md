Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is `p3 - p1` and must be at least `cur + 1`; `cur` is still less than `high` and `cur` is increased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `cur` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged, and the condition that `cur` is still less than `high` is maintained.
