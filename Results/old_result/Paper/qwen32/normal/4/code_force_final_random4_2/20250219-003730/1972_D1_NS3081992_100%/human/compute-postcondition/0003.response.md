The provided code snippet writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output. Since `func_15()` has been mentioned to return a positive integer and that value has been printed, the variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The function `func_10()` is not called in this snippet, so its return value does not affect the output state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, `func_10()` must return a positive integer, a positive integer value returned by `func_15()` has been printed to the standard output.**
