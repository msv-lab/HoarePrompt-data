The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 1, and `i` is 1**
