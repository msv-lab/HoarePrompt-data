Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`. If `ar[i] == num`, then `i` is 4, `same` is 4, `minn` is `inf`, and `num` is `ar[3]`. Otherwise, `i` is 5, `same` is 1, `minn` is 3, and `num` is `ar[4]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. If `ar[i] == num` was true before, `i` was 3, and now it is 4. If `ar[i] == num` was false before, `i` was 4, and now it is 5. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `_`, `same`, `minn`, and `num` remain unchanged except for `i`.
