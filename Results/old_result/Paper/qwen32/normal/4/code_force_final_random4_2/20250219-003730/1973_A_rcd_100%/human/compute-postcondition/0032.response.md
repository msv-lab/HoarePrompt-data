To determine the final output state of the loop, we need to analyze the conditions and the behavior of the loop. The loop continues to execute as long as `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Inside the loop, the following happens:

1. If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, the loop prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
2. Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is decremented by 1.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

- **First Iteration:** `x` is 0 and `y` is `p3`. The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is checked.
- **Second Iteration:** If the condition in the first iteration was not met, `x` becomes 1 and `y` becomes `p3 - 1`.
- **Third Iteration:** If the condition in the second iteration was not met, `x` becomes 2 and `y` becomes `p3 - 2`.

The loop will terminate when the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met, or when `y` becomes less than `x`, at which point the `else` block of the `while` loop will execute and print `p3`.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met at any iteration, the loop will print `p1 - x + p3` and terminate.
- If the condition is never met, the loop will terminate when `y` becomes less than `x`, and `p3` will be printed.

Since we do not have specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can generalize the final state based on the loop's behavior:
- The loop will either print `p1 - x + p3` if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is met at any point, or it will print `p3` if the loop exits because `y` becomes less than `x`.

Given that the loop has executed at least three times without breaking, it means that the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` has not been met in the first three iterations. Therefore, the loop will continue until either the condition is met or `y` becomes less than `x`.

If the loop exits because `y` becomes less than `x`, the final state will be:
- `x` will be incremented until `y` is less than `x`.
- `y` will be decremented until it is less than `x`.

Since the loop will print `p3` if it exits because `y` becomes less than `x`, the final output state is:

Output State: **p3.**

In natural language, this means that after all the executions of the loop have finished, the output will be `p3` if the condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` was never met throughout the iterations, and the loop terminated because `y` became less than `x`.
