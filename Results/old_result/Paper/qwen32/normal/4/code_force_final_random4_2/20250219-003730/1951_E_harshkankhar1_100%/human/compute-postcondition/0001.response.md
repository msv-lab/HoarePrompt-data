The code snippet reassigns the value of `n` to be the length of the input string `s` and sets `x` to -1. Since `n` was already defined as the length of the input string `s`, its value does not change. The value of `x` is explicitly set to -1.

Output State: **`s` is the input string; `n` is the length of the input string; `x` is -1.**
