Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is 0 if `i + 1` equals the length of `a` and `work` is `False` with `b[i] < a[i + 1]`; otherwise, `i` is 1, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations. `ans` is the first character of `a` if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and `work` is `False` with `b[i] < a[i + 1]`; otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `b`.**
