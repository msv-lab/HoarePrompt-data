Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string provided by the user input and has at least 2 characters, `i` is 0, `q` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. The integer value of the character at index `i` in `s` is less than the integer value of the character at index `i + 1` in `s`, so `count` is 1. `flag` is 0.**
