Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user's input; `j` is incremented by 1. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, `k` is set to `j + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `k` is set to the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to the incremented value of `j` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
