The code snippet appends the `node` to the queue `q`. The values of `ver`, `graph`, `vis`, and `node` remain unchanged. The only change is that `q` now includes the `node` at its end.

Output State: **`ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` and is a valid index in `graph`. `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have more than one element. `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise. `q` has had its leftmost element removed and now includes `node` at its end. `node` is the next element in `graph[ver]`.**
