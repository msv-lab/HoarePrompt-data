The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` was `n - 3`. After the decrement, `r` becomes `n - 4`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input where `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]` and `a[n - 3] == a[n - 4]`; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is `n - 4`; `r` is `n - 4`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal; `end` is 3**.
