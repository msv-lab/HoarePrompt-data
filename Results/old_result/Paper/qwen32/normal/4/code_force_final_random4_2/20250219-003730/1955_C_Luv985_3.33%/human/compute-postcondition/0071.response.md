The code `T -= 1` decrements the value of `T` by 1. Therefore, if `T` was initially `True` (which is equivalent to `1` in Python), it will now be `0` (which is equivalent to `False`).

Output State: **`l` is the final left index, `r` is the final right index, `k` is the remaining value, `ans` is the total number of elements reduced to zero, and `T` is False**.
