Output State: **`t` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`**

This means that the value of `ans` is calculated based on the formula provided, while `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` retain their values as described in the initial state.
