The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the constant `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is either `b` (if the loop completes all `b` iterations without `k` reaching `c`) or `j + 1` (where `j` is the iteration index at which `k` equals `c`). However, the value of `k` does not affect the loop condition, so we do not need to adjust `k`.

The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`k` is either `b` or `j + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, all other variables remain unchanged**. 

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can represent the state as:

State: **`k` is either `b` or `j + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, all other variables remain unchanged**.
