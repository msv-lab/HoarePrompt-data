The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `n`. 

Given that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, the loop will definitely execute because `n` is guaranteed to be greater than 1. The value of `max_item_idx` is 0 before the loop starts and does not affect whether the loop will execute.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure that the loop will execute. The state remains as provided.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is 0**
