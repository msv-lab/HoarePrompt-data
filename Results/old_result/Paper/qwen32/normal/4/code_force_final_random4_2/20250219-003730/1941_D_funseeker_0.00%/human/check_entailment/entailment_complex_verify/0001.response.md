Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated version to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Input Reading**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly read and parse the input as described.
2. **Logic for Ball Movement**:
   - The program uses a set `ans` to keep track of all possible positions the ball could be in after each throw.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` based on the direction and distance.
   - It correctly handles both clockwise (`'0'`), counterclockwise (`'1'`), and unknown (`'?'`) directions.
3. **Circular Nature Handling**: The program uses modulo operations to handle the circular nature of the problem.
4. **Final Output**: The program outputs the number of possible players who could have the ball and their sorted indices.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Input Reading:
- `func_1()`: Reads a line from the standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This is correct.
- `func_2()`: Reads an integer from the standard input. This is correct.
- `func_3()`: Reads a line from the standard input, splits it by whitespace, and converts each split part into an integer, returning the list of integers. This is correct.

#### Main Function (`func_4`):
- **Initialization**: The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`. This is correct.
- **Processing Throws**:
  - For each throw, the distance `r` and direction `c` are read.
  - If the direction is `'0'` (clockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), the new position `(q + r) % n` is added to the set `temp` for each current position `q` in `ans`.
  - If the direction is `'1'` (counterclockwise) or `'?'` (unknown), the new position `(q - r) % n` is added to the set `temp` for each current position `q` in `ans`.
  - After processing each throw, the set `ans` is updated to be `temp`.
- **Handling Modulo Operation**:
  - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if it is. This is a workaround to handle the modulo operation correctly for positions. However, this is not necessary because `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` will naturally result in values between `1` and `n` (inclusive) if `q` is between `1` and `n` (inclusive). The modulo operation ensures that the result is always within the range `[0, n-1]`. If `q + r` or `q - r` is `0`, it should wrap around to `n` directly without needing to check and replace `0` with `n`.

#### Output:
- The program outputs the number of possible players who could have the ball and their sorted indices, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the specified cases. The only minor issue is the unnecessary check and replacement of `0` with `n`, but it does not affect the correctness of the output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
