Output State: **`n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `t` is incremented by 1, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is a new input string that must contain at least one character, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of characters in the new `s`, and `i` is the next key in `hmp` after the current `i`. If `hmp[i] < m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`. `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`. Other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
