The `break` statement will exit the current loop or iteration, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `temp`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is `i`; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
