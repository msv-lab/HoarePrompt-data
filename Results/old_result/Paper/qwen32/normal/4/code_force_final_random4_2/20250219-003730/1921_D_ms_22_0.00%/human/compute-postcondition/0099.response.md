Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one integer, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is `[(-diff2, i, m - 1)]`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`, `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, and `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.**

Explanation: The `max_heap` list now contains a single tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
