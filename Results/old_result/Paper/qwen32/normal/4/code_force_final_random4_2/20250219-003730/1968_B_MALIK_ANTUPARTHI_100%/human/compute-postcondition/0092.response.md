Postcondition: **`k` is set to `e[0:].index(d[4]) + 1` if `d[4]` is in `e[k:]`, otherwise `k` is set to 4. `i` remains 3, `b` remains greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user, `j` remains 4. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `k == c` or `j == b - 1` when `d[4]` is in `e[k:]`, or unconditionally when `d[4]` is not in `e[k:]`.**
