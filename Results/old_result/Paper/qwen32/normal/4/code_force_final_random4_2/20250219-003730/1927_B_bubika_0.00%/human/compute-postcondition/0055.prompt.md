Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 3 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `b` is a list of integers where each element represents the total count of the corresponding element in `s`, `r` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 3 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of integers where each element represents the total count of the corresponding element in `s` and `b[x]` is incremented by 1, `r` is a string that now includes `a[x]` appended to it, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 3 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of integers where `b[x]` is incremented by 1, `r` is a string that includes `a[x]` appended to it, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `a[x]` is appended to `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 3 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the new input and must have at least one element, `b` is a list of integers where `b[x]` is incremented by 1, `r` is a string that includes `a[x]` appended to it twice, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `i` is the next element in the list `s` and `b[x]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
