The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and for each of `q` queries, it accepts two integers `l` and `r` representing a range within `a`. It then determines for each query whether there exists an index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of all elements from the start of the list up to `i` is equal to the XOR of all elements from the start up to `r`. The function outputs "Yes" if such an index exists, otherwise "No".
