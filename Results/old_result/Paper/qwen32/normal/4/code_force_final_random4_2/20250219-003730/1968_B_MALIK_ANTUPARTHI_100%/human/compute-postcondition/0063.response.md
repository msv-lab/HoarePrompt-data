Postcondition: **`k` is `j + 1` if `k == c` or `j == b - 1`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `b` is greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `d` and `e` are values, and `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `k == c` or `j == b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
