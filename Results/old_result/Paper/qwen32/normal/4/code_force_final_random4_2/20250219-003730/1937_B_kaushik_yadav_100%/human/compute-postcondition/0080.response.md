The value of `i` is set to 0, which overrides its previous value of the length of the newly stripped input string. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the newly stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is False, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations.
