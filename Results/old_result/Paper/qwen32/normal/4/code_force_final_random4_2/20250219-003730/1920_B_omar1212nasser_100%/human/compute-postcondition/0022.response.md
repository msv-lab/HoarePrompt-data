The code snippet appends a new element to the list `pos`. The new element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`. Therefore, the list `pos` will now have one additional element, which is the result of this calculation.

The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `s`, `i`, and `s2` remain unchanged unless `s2` was updated in the condition preceding the code snippet.

Output State: **`removals` is greater than 0, `negatives` is a non-negative integer, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is a list containing elements `(s - e_i) - 2 * s2`, `s - 2 * s2`, `s - 2 * s2`, and now also `s - 2 * s2`, `s` is decreased by `elements[-4]`, `i` is 4. If `negatives + 4` is less than or equal to the length of `elements`, then `s2` is updated to its previous value plus `elements[-(negatives + 4)]`. Otherwise, `s2` remains unchanged.**
