The given code snippet is:
```python
cx = set()
```

This line of code reassigns `cx` to be an empty set. Therefore, the set `cx` loses any previous values it might have had.

The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp`) are not affected by this line of code, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, `r` includes one more element `0`. Otherwise, `r` includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the total count of values in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).**
