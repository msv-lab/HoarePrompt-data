The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to the length of `a`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, and we have just completed the iteration where `j` was that value. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `len(a) - 1`.

Given that `a` is a non-empty string, `len(a) - 1` is at least 0. If `j` was `len(a) - 2` at the end of the previous iteration, then incrementing `j` by 1 would make `j` equal to `len(a) - 1`, and the loop would not execute again. Therefore, `j` must be less than `len(a) - 2` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1, and `j` must be less than `len(a) - 1`**
