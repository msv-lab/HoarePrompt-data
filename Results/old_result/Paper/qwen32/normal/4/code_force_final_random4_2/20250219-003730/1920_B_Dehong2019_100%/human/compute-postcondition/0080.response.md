The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute `k` times, and `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2x + k - 2`.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `2x + k - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is the third integer read from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `2x + k - 1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2])`, `_` is incremented by `x`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, then `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2]) + a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is not updated.**
