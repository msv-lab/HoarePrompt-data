The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value and `n` is a positive integer. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` and `n` should remain the same for the loop to potentially execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a set containing the element `arr[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**
