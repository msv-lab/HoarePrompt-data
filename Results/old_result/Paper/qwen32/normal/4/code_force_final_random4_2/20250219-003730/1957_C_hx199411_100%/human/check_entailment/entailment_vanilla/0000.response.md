### Reasoning:

The given problem involves a chessboard where two players alternately place rooks, with specific rules for how rooks can be placed and how the game progresses. The task is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after a given number of initial moves.

#### Key Points of the Problem:
1. **Game Rules**:
   - Players place rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard.
   - Players alternate turns, with the first player placing white rooks and the second player (computer) placing black rooks.
   - Rooks cannot be placed in positions that already have rooks or in positions that would cause them to attack each other (same row or column).
   - If a player places a rook at position (r, c), the computer places a rook at (c, r) unless r == c, in which case the computer skips its turn.
   - The game continues until no more valid moves are possible.

2. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the number of different final configurations of the board after the game ends, given the initial k moves.
   - The result should be printed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Approach**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the board size \( n \) and the number of initial moves \( k \).
   - It then processes the k moves, counting how many of these moves are on the diagonal (where r == c) and how many are off the diagonal.
   - The number of remaining free positions on the board is calculated as \( m = n - \text{number of moves} \).
   - For \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), the number of possible configurations is 1.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions such that no two rooks attack each other. This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using dynamic programming.

#### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly counts the number of moves on and off the diagonal.
- It calculates the remaining number of free positions \( m \).
- It handles the base cases where \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \) correctly.
- For \( m > 1 \), the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid configurations. The dynamic programming formula used is:
  \[
  dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
  \]
  This formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
