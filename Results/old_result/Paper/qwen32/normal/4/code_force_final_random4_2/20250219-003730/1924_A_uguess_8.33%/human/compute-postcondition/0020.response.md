The code snippet provided resets the variable `cur` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `cur` changes from its previous value to 0, while the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur_ss`, and `cnt` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is set to `cur | 1 << cur_ss`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cnt` is increased by 1; `cur` is 0.**
