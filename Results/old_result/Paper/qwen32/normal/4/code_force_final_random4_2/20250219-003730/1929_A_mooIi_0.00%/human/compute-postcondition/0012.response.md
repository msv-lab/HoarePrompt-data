Output State: **t is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 497, and ar is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input for the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will have been decremented by the number of iterations, meaning it will be 3 less than its initial value (since it was decremented by 1 for each of the 3 iterations). The variable `ar` will hold the sorted integers as strings from the input of the last iteration of the loop.
