You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of characters '0' and '1' with length 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):

                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):

    #State: The program will have printed the number of transitions between different characters in each string `s` provided by the user, incremented by 1 if there are no transitions where a character is less than the next character, for a total of `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's. It then calculates and prints the number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`. If there are no transitions where a '0' is followed by a '1', it increments the count by 1. This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program for the given problem description.

The task is to find the minimum number of pieces a binary string needs to be cut into so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string (all '0's before all '1's).

### Analysis of the Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Counting Transitions**:
   - The program counts the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string. This is done by checking if `s[i]` is different from `s[i + 1]`.
   - Each transition indicates a potential place where a cut might be needed.

2. **Handling Already Sorted Strings**:
   - The `flag` variable checks if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'. If there is no such transition, the string is already sorted, and the program should return `count + 1` (which is essentially 1 because `count` would be 0).

3. **Output**:
   - If there is at least one '0' followed by a '1', the number of pieces needed is equal to the number of transitions (`count`).
   - If there are no such transitions, the number of pieces needed is `count + 1`.

### Testing the Program:
Let's test the program with the provided examples and some additional edge cases.

#### Example 1:
Input:
```
6
11010
00000000
1
10
0001111
0110
```

Output:
```
3
1
1
2
1
2
```

The program works correctly for these examples.

#### Edge Cases:
1. **All '0's or All '1's**:
   - Input: `00000`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Alternating '0's and '1's**:
   - Input: `010101`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Actual Output: `5` (Correct)

3. **Single Character**:
   - Input: `1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)

4. **Two Characters, Already Sorted**:
   - Input: `01`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Actual Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Two Characters, Not Sorted**:
   - Input: `10`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Actual Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of pieces required for all the provided examples and the additional edge cases. There does not appear to be any scenario where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
