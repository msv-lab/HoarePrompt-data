The code snippet provided decrements the value of `nums_left` by 1. The other variables (`N`, `i`, `R`, `cur`, `ans`, `MOD`) are not directly modified by this statement. Therefore, their values remain as per the initial state, except for `nums_left` which is now one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 3, and `i` must be less than `N - 1`. If `i` equals `R[cur]`, `cur` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1.**
