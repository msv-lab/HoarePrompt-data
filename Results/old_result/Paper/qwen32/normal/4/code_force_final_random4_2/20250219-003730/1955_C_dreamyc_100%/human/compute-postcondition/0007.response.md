The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range of the loop is determined by `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The other variables (`k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `s_a`, `s_b`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given the provided state, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is at least 1. The other variables are already defined in such a way that they do not affect the execution condition of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 0, `s_a` is 0, `s_b` is 0, `i` is 0**
