Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer decremented by 1, `k` is the third input integer decremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input sorted in descending order, `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the condition does not hold and the else part is executed, but both parts do not alter the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x`.**
