The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0, which means at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

State: **`t` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input. If `a >= b`, the program does not change any additional variables. Otherwise, `k` is set to `min(b - a + 1, n)`, `ans` is set to `int((2*b - k + 1) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is set to `(n - k) * a`.**
