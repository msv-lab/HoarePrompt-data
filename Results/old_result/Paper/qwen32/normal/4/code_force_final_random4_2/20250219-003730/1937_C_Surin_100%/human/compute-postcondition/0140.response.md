Postcondition: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n`, `r` is the new user input, `r2` is the new user input if `r` is `'='`. If `r` is `'>'`, `prev` is set to `n`. If `r` is `'='` and `r2` is `'<'`, `prev` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.**
