`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `num_tests` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 999, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 0 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 999; `n` is an input integer**.
