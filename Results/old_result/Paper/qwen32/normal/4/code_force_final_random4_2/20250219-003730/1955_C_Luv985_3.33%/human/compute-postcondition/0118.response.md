Output State: **`l` is 1 and `r` is at least 2, or `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 1, and `k` is greater than 0; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The variable `mi` is assigned the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.
