To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
   - This variable does not influence the `print` statement directly.

2. **`n`**: Must be non-zero.
   - This variable does not influence the `print` statement directly.

3. **`coord`**: A sorted list of four tuples `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` based on tuple comparison.
   - This means the list is sorted in ascending order based on the tuple values.

4. **`res`**: Calculated as `math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`.
   - This requires understanding `p1` and `p2`.

5. **`i`**: Set to 4.
   - This variable does not influence the `print` statement directly.

6. **`p1`**: Calculated as `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
   - This is the difference in the x-coordinates of the second and first tuples in the sorted `coord` list.

7. **`p2`**: Calculated as `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.
   - This is the difference in the x-coordinates of the fourth and third tuples in the sorted `coord` list.

### Code Execution:
The code calculates `res` as the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, and then prints the rounded value of `res`.

### Detailed Calculation:
- `p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`: The difference in the x-coordinates of the second and first tuples.
- `p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`: The difference in the x-coordinates of the fourth and third tuples.
- `res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)`: The product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
- `round(res)`: Rounds the value of `res` to the nearest integer.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume a sample `coord` list for clarity:
- `coord = [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (7, 8)]` (already sorted based on tuple comparison).

- `p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) = (3 - 1) = 2`
- `p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) = (7 - 5) = 2`
- `res = math.sqrt(2) * math.sqrt(2) = 2`
- `round(res) = round(2) = 2`

### General Case:
Given the general `coord` list, the output will be the rounded value of the product of the square roots of the differences in the x-coordinates of the second and first tuples, and the fourth and third tuples.

### Final Output:
Output: **round(res) (where res is the product of the square roots of the differences in the x-coordinates of the second and first tuples, and the fourth and third tuples in the sorted coord list)**
