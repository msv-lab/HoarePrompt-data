The only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop. According to the loop statement, `i` ranges from `0` to `n - 2` (since the range is `range(0, n - 1)`).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, `k`, `r`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted based on the loop head's requirements.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` increased by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.**
