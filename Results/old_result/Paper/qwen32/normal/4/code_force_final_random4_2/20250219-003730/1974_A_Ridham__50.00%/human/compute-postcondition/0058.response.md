The function `func` accepts a parameter `t` which is an integer representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each test case, the function receives two integers `x` and `y` such that `0 <= x, y <= 99`. The function processes these test cases and returns the sum of `x` and `y` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y`. It returns the sum of `x` and `y` for each test case.**
