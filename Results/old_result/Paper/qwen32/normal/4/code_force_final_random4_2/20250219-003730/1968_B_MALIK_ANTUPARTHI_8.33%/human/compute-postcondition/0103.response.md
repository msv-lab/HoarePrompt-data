Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is the first integer from the user's input for the current iteration, `c` is the second integer from the user's input for the current iteration, `d` is the new input string for the current iteration, `e` is the value of the user's input for the current iteration, `i` is `a`, `j` is the last index processed before the loop breaks (which could be `b - 1`), and `k` is the value it held when the loop breaks for the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the output state reflects that the loop has executed `a` times. Each time, it processes the input values `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` as provided by the user. The variable `i` will be equal to `a`, indicating that all iterations are complete. The variable `j` will be the last index processed in the inner loop before it breaks, and `k` will hold the final value determined by the loop's conditions for the last iteration. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
