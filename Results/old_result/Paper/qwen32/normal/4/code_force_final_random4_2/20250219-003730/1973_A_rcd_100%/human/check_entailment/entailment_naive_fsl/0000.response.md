To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and verify that it handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is between 1 and 500.
   - Each test case consists of three integers \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \) where \( 0 \leq p_1, p_2, p_3 \leq 30 \).

2. **Logic for Maximum Draws:**
   - **Sum of Scores Check:** The program first checks if the total sum of scores \((p_1 + p_2 + p_3)\) is even. If not, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible since each game results in an even total score (either 0+2, 2+0, or 1+1).
   - **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
     - If \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the maximum number of draws is \( p_1 + p_2 \). This is because the third player's score could be entirely from wins against the other two players, and the remaining points could be from draws among the three.
     - Otherwise, the program uses a loop to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible values of \( x \) (points from wins by the first player) and \( y \) (points from wins by the second player) such that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \). The maximum number of draws is then calculated as \( p1 - x + p3 \).

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the program against the provided example input:

1. **Test Case: 0 0 0**
   - Total score is 0, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop but finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 0 \).

2. **Test Case: 0 1 1**
   - Total score is 2, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop and finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 1 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 1 \).

3. **Test Case: 1 1 1**
   - Total score is 3, which is odd.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

4. **Test Case: 1 1 2**
   - Total score is 4, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop and finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 2 \).

5. **Test Case: 3 3 3**
   - Total score is 9, which is odd.
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`.

6. **Test Case: 3 4 5**
   - Total score is 12, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), the maximum number of draws is \( p_1 + p_2 = 7 \).

7. **Test Case: 1 1 10**
   - Total score is 12, which is even.
   - Since \( p_3 < p_1 + p_2 \), it enters the loop and finds that \( p1 - x \leq p2 - y \) is satisfied with \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).
   - The maximum number of draws is \( p1 - 0 + p3 = 2 \).

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly handles the given test cases and the logic seems robust for all potential cases within the given constraints. It correctly checks for impossible score configurations and calculates the maximum number of draws in valid scenarios.

**Correctness: True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles all edge cases, including impossible score configurations and scenarios where the maximum number of draws needs to be calculated. It passes all the provided test cases and seems to be logically sound for all possible inputs within the constraints.
