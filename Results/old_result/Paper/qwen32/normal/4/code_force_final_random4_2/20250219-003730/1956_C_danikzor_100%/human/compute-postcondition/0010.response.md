Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`.
- `i` is set to 3.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Explanation:
1. **`print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))`**:
   - The `print` function is used to output values separated by spaces.
   - The first value to be printed is the integer `2`.
   - The second value to be printed is the variable `i`, which is `3`.
   - The `*range(n, 0, -1)` part is a bit more complex:
     - `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.
     - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence so that each number in the sequence is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function.

### Output:
- The first two numbers printed are `2` and `3`.
- The sequence generated by `range(n, 0, -1)` will be printed next, with each number separated by a space.
- Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, 3, n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1 (where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500)**
