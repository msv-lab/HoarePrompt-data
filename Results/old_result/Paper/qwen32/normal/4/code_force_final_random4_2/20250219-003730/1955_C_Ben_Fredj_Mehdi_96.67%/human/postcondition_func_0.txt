The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints a specific value based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the elements in `a`. The printed value is determined by a series of conditional checks and a final calculation if none of the conditions are met.
