test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters representing the path. The string consists of '.', '@', and '*' characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. It is guaranteed that the first cell in each path is empty.
