The code assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt` to the variable `ans`. This means `ans` will be a string consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table, repeated `cnt` times. 

For example, if `k` is 3, the character will be 'c' (since 'a' + 2 = 'c'). If `cnt` is 5, then `ans` will be 'ccccc'.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop; `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop; `s` remains unchanged as it is only read, not modified; `cnt` is less than `n` and holds the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was found in the string `s`; `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence; `tmp` is an empty string; `ans` is a string consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table, repeated `cnt` times.**
