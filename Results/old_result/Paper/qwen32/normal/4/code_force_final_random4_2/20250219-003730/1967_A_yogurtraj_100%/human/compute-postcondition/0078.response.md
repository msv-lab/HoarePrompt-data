Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is `ii + 2`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[ii + 2] + k // (ii + 3)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - (ii + 2)`, `k` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
