Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements, `data[index - 2]` is a string representing an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `n` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `q` is `q - 1`, `index` is `2n + 5 + 2*q + 2 + n + 4 + 2`, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2, `a` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `a[i]` is `int(data[index - (n + 1) + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n`, `pf` is a list of `n + 1` elements where `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]`, `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list, `mp[0]` contains the value `[0]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains all indices `i` for which `pf[i]` is the same, `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries plus `'NO'`, `l` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index in `v1` where `l` would be inserted to maintain sorted order, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `results` has been updated to include the string `'NO'` at the end of the list. All other variables retain their previously specified values.
