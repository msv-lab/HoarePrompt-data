The code snippet `ans += m - hmp[i]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `m - hmp[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially `k * m`, and `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

Thus, the new value of `ans` will be `k * m + m - hmp[i]`.

Output State: **`ans` is `k * m + m - hmp[i]`; `hmp` must contain at least one key-value pair, and the value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**
