Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values where the first element can be converted to an integer greater than 0; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0; `index` is `n + 5`; `results` is a list containing the string 'YES'; `n` is the integer value of the second element in `data`; `q` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `a[i]` which is `int(data[i + 2])` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `pf[i]` which is the cumulative XOR of `a[1]` to `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `mp` is a `defaultdict` with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list of indices `j` such that `pf[j]` equals `pf[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n`; `l` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `r` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and `x` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet contains only the statement `continue`, which means the program will continue with the next iteration of the loop it is inside. None of the variables are modified by this statement, so the output state remains the same as the initial state.
