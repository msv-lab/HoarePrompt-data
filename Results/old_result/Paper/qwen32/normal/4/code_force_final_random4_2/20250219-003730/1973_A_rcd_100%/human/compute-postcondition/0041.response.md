Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `x` is 0; `y` is `p3`.**

In natural language: The value of `y` is now set to `p3`. All other variables retain their initial state.
