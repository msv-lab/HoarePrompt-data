Output State: **Each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6. The first line of the input contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). It is guaranteed that neither the sum of `n` nor the sum of `m` over all test cases exceeds 2 · 10^6. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input. `ans` is assigned the value of `n`.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been assigned the value of `n`. All other conditions and variable assignments remain unchanged.
