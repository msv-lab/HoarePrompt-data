The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this means `ans1` will be reduced by twice the second element of the list `a`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer read from input
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `k` is an integer read from input
- `x` must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order
- `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the first element of `a`
- `i` is 1

After running the code:
- `ans1` is updated to be `ans1 - 2 * a[1]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus twice the first element of `a` minus twice the second element of `a`, `i` is 1**.
