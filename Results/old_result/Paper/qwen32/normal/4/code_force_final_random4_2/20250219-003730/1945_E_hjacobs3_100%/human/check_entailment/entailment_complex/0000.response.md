Reasoning:

The problem requires us to rearrange the elements of a permutation using at most two swap operations so that after performing a binary search, the element at the index `l` is equal to `x`. The provided program seems to be attempting to address this problem, but the approach it takes is flawed.

The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array and checks if the index `l` (where `l` ends up after the binary search) is the same as the index of `x` in the array. If they are not the same, it suggests swapping the elements at index `l` and the index of `x` to make `array[l]` equal to `x`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the binary search will correctly find `x` after the swap, as it does not ensure that the array is in a state where binary search would work correctly.

The binary search algorithm requires the array to be sorted, and the provided code does not sort the array or ensure that the array is in a state where binary search would correctly identify `x` after at most two swaps. The provided solution might work in some cases, but it does not guarantee a correct solution for all possible permutations and values of `x`.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
