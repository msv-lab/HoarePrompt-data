Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the size of a grid and an integer `k` representing the number of moves made on the grid. It also receives `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the row and column of each move. The function returns the result of each test case, which is not specified in the provided information, but it implies processing the moves on the grid and returning some output based on those moves.**
