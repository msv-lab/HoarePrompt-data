To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown
The initial state describes a formula that calculates a value, which is not directly assigned to `ans` but seems to be related to it. Hereâ€™s the formula:

\[ k \times m + \sum_{i \in hmp} (m - hmp[i]) \text{ for } hmp[i] < m \]

Where:
- \( k \) and \( m \) are variables with unspecified values.
- \( hmp \) is a dictionary (or similar mapping) with keys \( i \) and values \( hmp[i] \).
- The sum term iterates over all keys \( i \) in the dictionary \( hmp \) where the value \( hmp[i] \) is less than \( m \).

### Code Snippet
The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the variable `ans`:

```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis
The problem statement does not explicitly define the variable `ans`. However, based on the initial state, it seems that `ans` should hold the result of the formula mentioned. Therefore, we can infer that `ans` is the computed value of the formula:

\[ ans = k \times m + \sum_{i \in hmp} (m - hmp[i]) \text{ for } hmp[i] < m \]

### Output
Since the exact values of \( k \), \( m \), and the contents of the dictionary \( hmp \) are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe `ans` in terms of the given formula.

Output: **ans (where ans is calculated as \( k \times m + \sum_{i \in hmp} (m - hmp[i]) \text{ for } hmp[i] < m \))**
