Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The program only checks if there is a mutual friendship pair and returns 2 if found, otherwise it returns 3. However, this approach does not account for more complex scenarios where the minimum number of invitations could be 2 even if there is no mutual friendship pair.

For example, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
In this case, Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2. Friend 1's best friend is friend 2, and friend 2's best friend is friend 3. Since friend 1 and friend 2 are invited, both will attend the party. Friend 3 and friend 4 do not need to be invited in this scenario as only 2 friends are required.

However, the provided program would output 3 for this case because it does not find a mutual friendship pair (i.e., no `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`).

Another example:

**Input:**
```
1
4
3 4 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 3. Friend 1's best friend is friend 3, and friend 3's best friend is friend 1. Since both are invited, they will attend the party. Again, the provided program would output 3 for this case.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all cases correctly and might return incorrect results for scenarios where the minimum number of invitations is 2 without a mutual friendship pair.
