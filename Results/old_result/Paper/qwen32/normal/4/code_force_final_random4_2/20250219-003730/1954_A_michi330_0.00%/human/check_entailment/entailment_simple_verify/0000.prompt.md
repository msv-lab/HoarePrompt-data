You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of parts of the ribbon, the number of available colors, and the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `itest` is `t-1`, and for each of the `t` iterations, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. Depending on the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, either "NO" or "Yes" is printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their input values after each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
- **Alice** paints the ribbon with `n` parts using `m` colors.
- **Bob** can repaint at most `k` parts to the same color.
- Determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Conditions for "NO" (Bob can make all parts the same color):
1. If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color.
2. If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, Bob can repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

### Conditions for "YES" (Bob cannot make all parts the same color):
- If neither of the above conditions is met, Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

### Program Analysis
The provided program correctly handles the conditions for "NO" and "YES" as follows:
- It checks if `n <= k` and prints "NO" if true.
- It checks if `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` and prints "NO" if true.
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

Let's verify the correctness of the program by considering a few edge cases:

1. **Case: n = 1, m = 1, k = 1**
   - `n <= k` is true, so the output is "NO".
   - This matches the example.

2. **Case: n = 5, m = 1, k = 1**
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 5 = 0`, and `0 < 1` is true, so the output is "NO".
   - This matches the example.

3. **Case: n = 5, m = 2, k = 1**
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`, and `2 < 1` is false, so the output is "YES".
   - This matches the example.

4. **Case: n = 5, m = 2, k = 2**
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`, and `2 < 2` is false, so the output is "YES".
   - This does not match the example where the output should be "NO". This is an issue.

5. **Case: n = 5, m = 5, k = 3**
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4`, and `4 < 3` is false, so the output is "YES".
   - This matches the example.

### Conclusion
The program fails for the case `n = 5, m = 2, k = 2` where the expected output is "NO" but the program outputs "YES". Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation
The program incorrectly handles the case where `n - math.ceil(n / m) == k`. In such cases, Bob can still repaint all parts to the same color by repainting exactly `k` parts. The condition should be `n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` instead of `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
