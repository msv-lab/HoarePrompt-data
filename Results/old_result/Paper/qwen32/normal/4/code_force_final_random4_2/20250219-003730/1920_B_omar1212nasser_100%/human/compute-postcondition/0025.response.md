Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (a non-negative integer), `negatives` (a non-negative integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It calculates a list `pos` where the first element is derived from the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`, and subsequent elements are adjusted based on the number of removals allowed. The function returns the maximum value from this list `pos`.**
