The code snippet assigns the value of `j` to `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, and the condition that `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]` remain unchanged. The only change is the value of `k`, which is now equal to `j`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is an input string; `k` is `j`; the character `d[j]` is not in the substring `e[k:]`**.
