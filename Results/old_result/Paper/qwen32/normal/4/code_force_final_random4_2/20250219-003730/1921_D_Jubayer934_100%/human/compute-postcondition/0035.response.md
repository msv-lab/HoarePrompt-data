Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is -1; `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all `i` in the range from `temp` to `n-1` if `temp` is not -1; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.`**

Natural Language: The value of `temp` has been set to -1. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
