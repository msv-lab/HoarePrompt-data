The code snippet provided sets the variable `temp` to `-1`. This action does not affect any other variables or their values. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is -1; `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `temp` to `n - 1` if `temp` is not -1, otherwise `ans` contains the absolute differences between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n - 1`; `a` remains the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` remains the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` will have reached `n` after the loop completes.**
