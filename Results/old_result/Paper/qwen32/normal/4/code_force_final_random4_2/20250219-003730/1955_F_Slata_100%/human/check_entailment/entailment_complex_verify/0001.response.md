### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis

The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice by removing numbers optimally. Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The XOR properties are:
- XOR of an even number of identical numbers is zero.
- XOR of an odd number of 1s is 1.
- XOR of an odd number of 2s is 2.
- XOR of an odd number of 3s is 3.
- XOR of an odd number of 4s is 4.
- XOR of a mix of numbers will be non-zero if the count of any number type is odd.

Eve's strategy is to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero, which can be achieved by ensuring that after removing a number, the count of each number type remains even as much as possible.

#### Program Analysis

The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by:
1. Calculating the number of pairs (even numbers) for each type of number (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`).
2. Checking if there is an odd count of all four numbers (`a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3`). If true, it adds 1 to the count, accounting for the scenario where the last remaining numbers are one of each type (1, 2, 3), making the XOR zero.

#### Example Walkthrough

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 1 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Bob wins once when all numbers are removed)

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - Calculation: `1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 + int(1 % 2 + 0 % 2 + 1 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Bob wins once by removing one 1 and one 3)

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - Calculation: `2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(2 % 2 + 2 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Bob wins three times by leaving pairs of numbers)

4. **Fourth Example**:
   - Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - Calculation: `3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 + int(3 % 2 + 3 % 2 + 2 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4`
   - Output: `3` (Bob wins three times by leaving pairs of numbers, with the last removal making the XOR zero)

5. **Fifth Example**:
   - Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - Calculation: `0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + int(0 % 2 + 9 % 2 + 9 % 2 == 3)`
   - Result: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13`
   - Output: `12` (Bob wins twelve times by leaving pairs of numbers)

#### Annotations and Validation

The annotations describe the program's state at key points, confirming that the program processes each test case correctly and calculates the result based on the counts of each number type.

#### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by considering the optimal strategy of Eve in removing numbers. The annotations and the example walkthroughs support the correctness of the program.
