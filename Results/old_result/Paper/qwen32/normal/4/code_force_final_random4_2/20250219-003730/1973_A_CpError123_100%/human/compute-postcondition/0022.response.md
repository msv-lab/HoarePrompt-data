Postcondition: **`t` is 2, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input, and their sum is odd; `x` is the integer value of (a + b + c) // 2; `y` is the integer value of a + b`. Since the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the if condition `(a + b + c) % 2 != 0` is always true, and the postconditions of the if part are maintained.**
