The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the innermost loop or if statement it is nested within. Since there is no loop or if statement provided in the code snippet, the `break` statement will not have any effect on the variables or the program flow. Therefore, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `p` is `l[1]`; `q` is `l[l[1] - 1]`.**
