The function `func` accepts three integer parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` representing the scores of three players, sorted in non-decreasing order. Additionally, there are `t` such test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the scores. However, the specific output for each case is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` for each of the `t` test cases, representing the scores of the players in non-decreasing order, and return a result for each test case based on these scores.
