The code appends the index of the last element of `x` to the list `inds[x[-1]]`. Given that `x[-1]` is `i`, and `inds[i]` initially contains `[1]`, after the code executes, `inds[i]` will be `[1, 3]` (since `len(x) - 1` is `3`).

Here is the updated state:

- `n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`.
- `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must have at least two elements.
- `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
- `x` is `[0, i, 0, i]`.
- `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[1, 3]`.
- `i` is the third element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)` and must have at least two elements, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is `[0, i, 0, i]`, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0, 2]` and `inds[i]` is `[1, 3]`, `i` is the third element of `a`.**
