The code snippet assigns the values returned by `func_1()` to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the specific values returned by `func_1()` are not provided, we can only state that `n` and `k` will be updated to whatever values `func_1()` returns. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n will still hold true if `func_1()` adheres to these constraints.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, where `n` is a positive integer and `1 <= k <= n`.**
