The code snippet assigns the value of `(n - k) * a` to the variable `p2`. Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged, but `p2` is newly assigned a value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input; `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the smaller of `b - a + 1` and `n`; `ans` is the integer value of the sum of the `k` largest elements from the range `[a, b]`; `p2` is `(n - k) * a`**.

In simple terms, the output state includes the original conditions and values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`, and `ans`, with the addition of `p2` being calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
