The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and maps them into a list named `L`. This affects the variable `L` by assigning it the list of integers from the input. The variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state and not affected by the new code snippet.

Output State: **`N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input, representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
