### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the maximum number of draws from the scores of three players in a series of chess games. Here's a detailed analysis of the program and its logic:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players, with the condition that `a <= b <= c`.

2. **Sum of Scores**:
   - The program checks whether the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program outputs `-1` because it is impossible to have a consistent set of games where the total points sum up to an odd number (since each game awards an even number of points, either 0+2, 1+1, or 2+0).

3. **Calculating Draws**:
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program calculates `x` as half of the total sum `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the maximum possible number of games played, since each game contributes 2 points to the total.
   - It also calculates `y` as the sum of the two lower scores `(a + b)`. This represents the maximum number of games that could have involved the two players with the lower scores, which is a constraint on the maximum number of games that could have occurred.
   - The program then outputs the minimum of `x` and `y`, which represents the maximum possible number of draws.

### Analysis of the Program Logic:

- **Odd Sum Check**: The check for an odd sum is correct. If the total points are odd, it is impossible to have a valid set of games, so `-1` is the correct output.
- **Maximum Number of Draws**: The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is also correct. The variable `x` represents the total number of games, and `y` represents the maximum number of games involving the two players with the lower scores. The minimum of these two values correctly represents the maximum number of draws.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores, and it correctly handles the case where the scores cannot be the result of any valid set of games.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
