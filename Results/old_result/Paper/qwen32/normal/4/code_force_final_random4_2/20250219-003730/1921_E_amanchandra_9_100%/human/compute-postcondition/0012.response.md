The code assigns the variable `l` the value of `max(1, b - x)`. Given that `x` is `(c - a) // 2`, and the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even, the value of `x` is an integer. The value of `l` will be the maximum of 1 and the result of `b - x`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers read from the input; `a` is less than or equal to `c`; `x` is `(c - a) // 2`; the absolute difference between `a` and `c` is even; `l` is `max(1, b - x)`**.
