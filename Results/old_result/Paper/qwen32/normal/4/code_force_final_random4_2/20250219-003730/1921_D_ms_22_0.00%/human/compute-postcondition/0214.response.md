Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`. If `item[2]` (index_in_b) is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `tp1` and `tp2` are updated based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`, and `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `max_diff`, and `tp1` and `tp2` are updated accordingly. `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`.**
