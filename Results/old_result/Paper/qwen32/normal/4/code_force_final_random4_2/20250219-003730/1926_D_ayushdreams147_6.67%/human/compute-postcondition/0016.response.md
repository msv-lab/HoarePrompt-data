The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `res` can be either 1, 2, or 0, after the increment, `res` can be either 2, 3, or 1 respectively.

The other variables `n`, `a`, `num`, and `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`, `res` is either 2, 3, or 1, `num` is `a[i+1]`, `count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
