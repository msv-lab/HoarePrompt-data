Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user's input. If `d[j]` is present in the substring of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of `e`, then `k` is updated to `j + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` remains `j` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
