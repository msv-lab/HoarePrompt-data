The code snippet `dp[2] = 3` sets the value at index 2 of the list `dp` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over the `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`, and `m` is not equal to 0 or 1; `dp` is a list of zeros with length `m + 1` except `dp[1]` which is 1 and `dp[2]` which is 3.**
