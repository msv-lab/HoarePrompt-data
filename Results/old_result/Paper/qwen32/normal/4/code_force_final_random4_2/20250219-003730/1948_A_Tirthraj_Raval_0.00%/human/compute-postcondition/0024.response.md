The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `pattern`. This action does not change the values of `t` or `n`, nor does it modify the conditions related to `pattern` based on the parity of `n` or the value of `n // 2`. The only change is that `pattern` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 49; `n` is an input integer; `pattern` is an empty list.**
