The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. This means the variable `cnt` is now 0, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the new string provided by the user input, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new string provided by the user input, `f` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the string `t`, `cnt` is 0. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.**
