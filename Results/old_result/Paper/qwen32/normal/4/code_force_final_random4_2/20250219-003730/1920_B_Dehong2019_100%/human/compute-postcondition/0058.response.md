Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans2` remains as calculated in the previous iteration. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` and then decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`. Otherwise, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.**
