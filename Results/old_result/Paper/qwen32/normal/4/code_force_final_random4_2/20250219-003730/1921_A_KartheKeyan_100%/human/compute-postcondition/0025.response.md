The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. This means that the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on the input provided. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0; `i` is 0; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input; `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`; `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`.**
