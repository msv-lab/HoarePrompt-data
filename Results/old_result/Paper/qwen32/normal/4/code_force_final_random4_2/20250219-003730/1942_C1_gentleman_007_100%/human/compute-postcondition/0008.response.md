Output State: **`ver` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list of lists where `graph[ver]` must have at least one adjacent vertex, `vis` is a list of integers where `vis[i]` is 1 if vertex `i` has been visited and 0 otherwise, with `vis[ver]` set to 1, and `q` is a deque containing the node. The current node is such that `vis[node]` is 0.**

In natural language: The output state is that `ver` remains an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` remains unchanged, `vis` remains a list of integers where `vis[ver]` is 1, and `q` now contains the node. The current node's visit status in `vis` is still 0, and it has been appended to the deque `q`.
