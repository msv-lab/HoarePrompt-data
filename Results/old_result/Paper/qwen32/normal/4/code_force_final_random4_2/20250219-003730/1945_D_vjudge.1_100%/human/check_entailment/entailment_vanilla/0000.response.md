Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
Kirill wants to be among the first `m` people in the queue with the minimum cost. To move up the queue, he can bribe people in front of him. The cost to bribe the `i-th` person is `a[i]`, and for each person `k` between `j` and `i` (where `j < k < i`), Kirill has to pay `b[k]` coins.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the list `a`, and the list `b`. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters.

In `func_1`:
1. A list `c` is created where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This suggests that the program might be trying to minimize the cost for each position.
2. A suffix sum array `suff` is created. `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`. This is used to calculate the total cost of bribing all people from position `i` to the end.
3. The program then tries to find the minimum cost for Kirill to be at any of the first `m` positions. It calculates the cost for each position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and keeps track of the minimum cost.

### Issues in the Program:
The program's logic seems flawed. Specifically:
- The cost to bribe a person at position `i` involves not only `a[i]` but also the `b` costs for all people between the person Kirill bribes and his current position. The program does not account for the `b` costs correctly.
- The use of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` in the list `c` is not appropriate because `a[i]` and `b[i]` serve different purposes in the problem. `a[i]` is the direct cost to bribe the `i-th` person, and `b[i]` is the additional cost for each person between the person being bribed and Kirill's current position.

### Correctness:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
