The code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the given formula. Here is the updated state after the execution of the code:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is updated based on the value of `el` where it is reduced by 1 if `el` is '>'; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, and the last element is removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing elements that are accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`; `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`; `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`; `i` is `k - 2`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ans[i]` has been updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` while all other variables retain their previous values.
