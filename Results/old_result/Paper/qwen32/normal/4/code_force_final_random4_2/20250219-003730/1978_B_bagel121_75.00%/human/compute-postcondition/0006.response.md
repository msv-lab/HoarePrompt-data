The variable `k` is assigned the value of the smaller of `b - a + 1` and `n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input; `a` is less than `b`; `k` is the smaller of `b - a + 1` and `n`.**
