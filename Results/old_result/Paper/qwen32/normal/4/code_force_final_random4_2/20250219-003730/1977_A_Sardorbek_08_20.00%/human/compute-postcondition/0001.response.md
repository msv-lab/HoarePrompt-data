The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100 and each of the following `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100; `a` is an input integer. For the loop to execute, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1.

The state of `t` and the values of `n` and `m` in the `t` lines do not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `a` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1**
