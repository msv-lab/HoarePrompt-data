The variable `v2` is updated to the value of `i`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `v2` will now also be `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`.

Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`**.
