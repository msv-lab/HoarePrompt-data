Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `kp` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 3.
- `g` is 0.
- `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations.
- `i` is 3.
- `r` is a new input string.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `prev` is not defined in the given initial state. Since `prev` is not defined, it would raise a `NameError` if the code were to be executed as is. However, since the task is to determine what would be printed based on the given information, we will assume that `prev` is intended to be some variable or value that should be known from the context (which is not provided here).

Since `prev` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, based on the given format, we can describe the output in terms of `prev`.

### Output:
The print statement will output a formatted string with the values of `i` and `prev`.

Output: **? 3 3 [prev] [prev] (where [prev] is the value of the variable `prev`)**
