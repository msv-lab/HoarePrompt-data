Output State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `min(L[1], k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.**

Natural language: The value of `q` has been calculated as the integer ceiling of `k` divided by `m`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
