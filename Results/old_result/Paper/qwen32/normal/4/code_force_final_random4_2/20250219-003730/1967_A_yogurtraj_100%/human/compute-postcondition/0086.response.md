Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer provided by the input; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `ii` is incremented by `n - 1` from the previous iteration. If `k` is not equal to 0, then `k` is `k - sum((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) for i in range(0, n - 1))` and `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `k` is 0 and `r` is `a[n - 1]`.**
