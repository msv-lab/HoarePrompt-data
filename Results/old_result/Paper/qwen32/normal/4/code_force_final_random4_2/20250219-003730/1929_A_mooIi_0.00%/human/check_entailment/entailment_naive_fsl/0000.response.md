Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The function `func()` sorts the array and prints it, but it does not calculate the beauty as described in the problem statement. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, not the sorted array itself. 

Here is a corrected version of the code that calculates the maximum beauty:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += ar[i] - ar[i - 1]
        print(beauty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the original code, the line `ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))` sorts the array but then converts the elements to strings, which is not needed. The code also does not calculate the beauty, so it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
