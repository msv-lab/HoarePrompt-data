The code snippet provided assigns the value `1` to the `i`-th element of the list `prog_cities`. This means that the value at index `i` in `prog_cities` changes from `0` to `1`.

Output State: **`cities` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (with `n` being at least 2) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` integers where the `i`-th element is `1` and all other elements are `0`; `i` is 0 or greater than 0; if `i` is greater than 0, `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise `forward` is 999999999999999999; if `i` is 0, `back` is -999999999999999999 and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise `forward` is 999999999999999999; the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`.**

In simpler terms, the `i`-th element of `prog_cities` is now `1`, while all other elements remain `0`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
