The code snippet adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`.**
