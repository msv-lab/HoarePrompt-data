Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a series of values based on the sum of the list `elements` and a subset of its last `negatives` elements, then returns the maximum value from these calculations.**
