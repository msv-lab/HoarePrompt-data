To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the state of the variables.

### Analysis of the Loop:
- The loop starts with `i` ranging from `temp` to `n-1`.
- For each iteration, it appends `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` to the `ans` list.

### Given Initial and Output States:
- **Initial State:** `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing `n` elements `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is `n`.
- **Output State after 1 iteration:** `ans` has `n+1` elements.
- **Output State after 2 iterations:** `ans` has `n+2` elements.
- **Output State after 3 iterations:** `ans` has `n+3` elements.

### Final Output State:
- The loop runs from `i = temp` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute `n - temp` times.
- Each iteration appends one element to `ans`, so after the loop completes, `ans` will have `n + (n - temp)` elements.
- Since `temp` is an integer less than `n`, the loop will append `n - temp` elements to the initial `n` elements already in `ans`, resulting in `2n - temp` elements in `ans`.

### Conclusion:
- The final state of `ans` will be a list with `2n - temp` elements.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
- The variable `i` will be `n` after the loop completes.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is an integer less than `n`, `ans` is a list containing `2n - temp` elements, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, and `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, the `ans` list will have `2n - temp` elements, and all other variables will remain as they were initially, except `i` which will be `n`.
