The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('0')
```

This statement directly prints the character '0' to the console. The value to be printed is explicitly given as a string '0' and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **0**
