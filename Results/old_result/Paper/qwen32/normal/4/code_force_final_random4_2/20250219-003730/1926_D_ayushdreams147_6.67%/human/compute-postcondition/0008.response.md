Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`. If `num` was not in `count`, then `res` is 1 and `count` is a dictionary with one entry `{num ^ (1 << 31) - 1: 1}`. Otherwise, `res` is 0 and the value associated with the key `num` in `count` has been decremented by 1.**
