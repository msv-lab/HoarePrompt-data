### Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`).

2. **Logic for Constructing the String:**
   - If `n` is odd, the program outputs "NO", indicating that it is not possible to construct such a string with an odd number of special characters.
   - If `n` is even, the program outputs "YES" and constructs a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters. The construction ensures that each character (except the first and last) has exactly one neighbor that is the same, thus making them special characters.

3. **Pattern Construction:**
   - The pattern is constructed by appending 'A' and 'B' alternately. For example, for `n = 6`, the pattern would be "ABABAB", which has exactly 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8).
   - The pattern is generated by iterating `n // 2` times, appending 'A' and 'B' in alternating fashion.

4. **Validation:**
   - The logic correctly identifies that an odd number of special characters cannot be achieved with the given constraints, as each special character requires a pair of identical neighbors, which is not possible with an odd count.
   - For even `n`, the constructed string satisfies the condition of having exactly `n` special characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a suitable string can be constructed based on the given constraints and correctly constructs such a string when possible.

**Correctness: True**
