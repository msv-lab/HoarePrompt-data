The `print(-1)` statement will output the integer `-1` regardless of the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial state provides information about these variables but does not affect the execution of the `print(-1)` statement, which is a simple output of the constant value `-1`.

Output: **-1**
