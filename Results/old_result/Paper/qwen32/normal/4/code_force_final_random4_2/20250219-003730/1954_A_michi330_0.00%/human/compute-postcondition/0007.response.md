Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input. If the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is true, then the if part is executed. Otherwise, the else part is executed. The values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged regardless of which part is executed.**
