The code calculates the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` and assigns it to `diff1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `diff1`, which holds the calculated absolute difference.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`. The current `item[2]` (index_in_b) is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`.**
