The code snippet `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the incremented value of `tp1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` contains at least one element but does not include the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `item` is the tuple with the smallest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`; `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`; `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`; `tp1` is incremented by 1.**
