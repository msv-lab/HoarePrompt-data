The code snippet provided involves pushing a tuple into a max heap using the `heapq.heappush` function. The tuple contains the negative of `diff2`, the variable `i`, and `m - 1`. Since Python's `heapq` module only provides a min-heap, to simulate a max-heap, the first element of the tuple is negated.

Given the initial state, the value of `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. The tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` is then pushed into the `max_heap`, which was initially empty.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` is a list containing the tuple `(-abs(i - b[m - 1]), i, m - 1)`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`; `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`**.
