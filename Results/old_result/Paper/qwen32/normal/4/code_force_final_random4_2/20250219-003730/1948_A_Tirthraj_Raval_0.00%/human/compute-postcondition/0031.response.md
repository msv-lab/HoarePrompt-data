To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer input by the user such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 49\).
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `pattern` is a list with the last element being 'A' if the new `i` is even, or 'B' if the new `i` is odd.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The loop statement is:
```python
for i in range(n // 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`.
2. **Loop Variable**: `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: `i` has been incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to its value at the start of the next iteration.
4. **Pattern Update**: The `pattern` list is updated based on whether the new `i` is even or odd. Since we are adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `i` before the increment.

### Adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, to get the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to subtract 1 from the current value of `i`.
- The value of `n` does not change.
- The value of `t` does not affect the loop directly, so it remains unchanged.
- The `pattern` list is not part of the loop head, so we do not adjust it here. However, we know that the next element added to `pattern` will depend on the new value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
If at the end of the previous iteration `i` was some value `x`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x - 1 + 1 = x`. However, since `i` has already been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to consider the value of `i` before that increment, which means we should just keep `i` as it is for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 49\); `n` is an integer greater than 1; `pattern` is a list with the last element being 'A' if the new `i` is even, or 'B' if the new `i` is odd; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Since `i` has already been incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x`.

Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` as the value it was at the end of the previous iteration before the increment.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x - 1 + 1 = x`.
