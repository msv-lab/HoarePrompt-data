The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000), `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
