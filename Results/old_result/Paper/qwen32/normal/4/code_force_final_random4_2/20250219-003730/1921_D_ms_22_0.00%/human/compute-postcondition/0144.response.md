The provided code snippet only modifies the variable `tp1` by incrementing it by 1. None of the other variables mentioned in the initial state are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the incremented value of `tp1` while all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is `ans - item[0]`, `tp1` is `tp1 + 1`.**
