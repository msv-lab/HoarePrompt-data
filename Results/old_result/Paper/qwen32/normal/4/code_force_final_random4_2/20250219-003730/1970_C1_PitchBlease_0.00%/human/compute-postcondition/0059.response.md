Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `start` and `target`, which are integers representing the starting node and the target node in a tree, respectively. The tree is represented as an adjacency list where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors. The function performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path distance from the start node to the target node. If the target node is reachable from the start node, the function returns the shortest path distance (`dist`). If the target node is not reachable, the function returns -1.**
