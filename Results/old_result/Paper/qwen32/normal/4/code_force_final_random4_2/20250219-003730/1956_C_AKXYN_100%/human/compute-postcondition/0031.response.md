The given code snippet modifies the value of `res` based on the current values of `i` and `res`. The initial state specifies that `i` is 2 and `res` is 7.

Here's the calculation:
- The expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` is evaluated with `i` being 2.
- Substituting `i` with 2, we get `(2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1)` which simplifies to `3 * 5` and results in `15`.
- This value `15` is then added to the current value of `res` which is `7`, resulting in `7 + 15 = 22`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `mat` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 22, `i` is 2**.
