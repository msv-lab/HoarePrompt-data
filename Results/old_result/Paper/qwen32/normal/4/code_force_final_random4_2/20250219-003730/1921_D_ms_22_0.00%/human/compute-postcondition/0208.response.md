The code snippet `ans += -item[0]` adds the negative of the first element of the tuple `item` to the variable `ans`. Given that `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`, and `max_heap` contains tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`, `-item[0]` is equivalent to `max_diff`.

Thus, the value of `ans` is incremented by `max_diff`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is the original `ans` plus `max_diff`; `item` is the tuple with the largest `max_diff` value from the original `max_heap`. Additionally, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive.**
