Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr` (i.e., `s` contains `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, ..., `arr[n-1]`), and `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2, or 1 if `n-2` is even, and 0 if `n-2` is odd.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the set `s` will contain all the unique elements from the list `arr`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `ans` retains its initial value based on the conditions specified.
