The code snippet provided assigns a new value to `p2` based on the expression `(n - k) * a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `k` are already defined in the initial state. No other variables are affected by this code.

Let's calculate the new value of `p2`:
- `p2` is assigned the value `(n - k) * a`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.

The values of `t`, `b`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
