To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The provided state includes `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, which are not directly part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted according to the task requirements. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the given loop head.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. This means the loop will iterate `n` times, with `i` starting from 0 and going up to `n-1`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop variable `i` starts at 0 as per the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, the only requirement to ensure the loop executes is that `n` must be greater than 0. The values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<'; `pair_idx` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<'; `n` must be greater than 0**
