The code snippet provided assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `k`) are not directly modified by this line of code, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Given that `i` is defined as `ii + 2`, the value of `r` will be the element at the index `i + 1` in the list `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list of integers and `i` is calculated based on `ii`, the value of `r` will be a specific integer from the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is `ii + 2`, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**
