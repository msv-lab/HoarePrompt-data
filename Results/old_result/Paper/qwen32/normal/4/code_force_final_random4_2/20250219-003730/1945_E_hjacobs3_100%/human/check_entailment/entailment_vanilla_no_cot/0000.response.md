Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The main issues are:

1. The program does not handle the case where two swaps are needed to correctly position `x` so that the binary search algorithm can find it.
2. The program does not correctly identify when a swap is necessary and which elements to swap.
3. The program assumes that if the element `x` is not at the position `l` after the binary search, a single swap is enough, which is not always true.

The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to swap, but it only handles a single swap and does not account for the possibility of needing two swaps.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed to determine the correct positions of elements to perform up to two swaps to ensure that after binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.
