Postcondition: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains at least one element, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string). If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
