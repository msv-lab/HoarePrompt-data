Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to include the first character of the string `a`. All other variables retain their initial state values.
