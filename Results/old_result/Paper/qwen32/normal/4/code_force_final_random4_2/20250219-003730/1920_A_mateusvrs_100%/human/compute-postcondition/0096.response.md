The code snippet `r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)` appends a new element to the list `r`, which is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1.
- `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was not 1 or 2.
- `ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2.
- `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1.
- `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.
- `tmp` is the total count of values in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).

The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` determines the new element to append to `r`. Since the other variables (`t`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp`) are not modified by this line of code, their values remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it and includes the new element `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is the total count of values in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).**
