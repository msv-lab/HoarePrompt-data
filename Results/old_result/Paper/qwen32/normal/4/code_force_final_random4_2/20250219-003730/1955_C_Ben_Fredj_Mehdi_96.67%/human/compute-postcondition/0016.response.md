The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'1'`. This string is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables defined in the initial state (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `a[0]`).

Let's break it down step by step:
1. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, `k`, and `a[0]`), but these are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'1'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
