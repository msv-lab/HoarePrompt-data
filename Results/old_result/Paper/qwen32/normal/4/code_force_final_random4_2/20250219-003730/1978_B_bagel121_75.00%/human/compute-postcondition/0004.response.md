To determine what will be printed by the `print(n * a)` statement, we need to consider the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.

The `print(n * a)` statement will output the product of `n` and `a`. Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **n * a (where n and a are integers read from the input)**
