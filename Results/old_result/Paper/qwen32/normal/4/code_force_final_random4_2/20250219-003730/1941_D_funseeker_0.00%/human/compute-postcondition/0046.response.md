To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve over time. Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `m` is still greater than 0.
   - `x` and `ans` are sets containing initial values.
   - `r` is derived from the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`.
   - `c` is derived from the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]`.
   - `temp` is an initially empty set.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `q` in `ans`, the loop checks the value of `c`.
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - The loop continues until all elements in `ans` are processed.

3. **Output State after 3 Iterations**:
   - The state after 3 iterations includes the updated `ans` and `temp` sets based on the operations performed in the loop.

4. **Output State after All Iterations**:
   - After all iterations, `ans` will be exhausted, and `temp` will contain all the computed values.
   - `n` will be one less than its initial value, and `m` will still be greater than 0.
   - `x` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `r` and `c` will retain their values from the last iteration of `func_1()`.

Given these points, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

- `n` will be one less than its initial value.
- `m` will still be greater than 0.
- `x` will remain unchanged.
- `ans` will be an empty set since all elements have been processed.
- `temp` will contain all the values computed during the loop iterations.
- `r` and `c` will retain their values from the last iteration of `func_1()`.

Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` is an empty set, `temp` contains all computed values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`, and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]`.**
