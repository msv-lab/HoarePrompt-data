To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition that controls the loop: `while max_heap:`. This loop will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input
- `a` is a list of integers read from the input
- `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order
- `max_heap` contains `n-1` tuples of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, `max_heap` must not be empty. Therefore, the state of `max_heap` needs to be adjusted to ensure it still contains at least one tuple.

State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`**.
