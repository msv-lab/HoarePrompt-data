### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The function `func()` sorts the array and prints the sorted elements as a space-separated string, but it does not calculate the beauty, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the provided code. It reads the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the array elements, sorts the array, and prints the sorted array. However, it does not compute the beauty of the array as required.

To compute the maximum beauty, the code should calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, as shown in the corrected version of the code provided in the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
