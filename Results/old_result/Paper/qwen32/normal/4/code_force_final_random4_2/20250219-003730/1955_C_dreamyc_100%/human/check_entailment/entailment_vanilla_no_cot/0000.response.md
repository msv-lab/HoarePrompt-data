Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken. The approach in `func_1` is flawed. It attempts to count the number of ships that can be sunk by summing the durability from the start and end, but it does not correctly account for the alternating pattern of attacks and the fact that ships are removed from consideration once they sink.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the attacks while keeping track of the ships that have already sunk. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def count_sunk_ships(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    attacks = 0
    sunk = 0

    while k > 0 and nums:
        if attacks % 2 == 0:
            # Attack the first ship
            if nums[0] > 0:
                nums[0] -= 1
                if nums[0] == 0:
                    nums.popleft()
                    sunk += 1
            else:
                nums.popleft()
        else:
            # Attack the last ship
            if nums[-1] > 0:
                nums[-1] -= 1
                if nums[-1] == 0:
                    nums.pop()
                    sunk += 1
            else:
                nums.pop()
        attacks += 1
        k -= 1

    return sunk

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = count_sunk_ships(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)
```

This program uses a deque to efficiently remove ships from both ends and simulates the attacks in the specified pattern until either all attacks are used or all ships have sunk.
