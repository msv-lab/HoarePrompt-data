Output State: **kp is the total number of test cases minus one, n is the input integer for the current test case, g is 0, v1 is the index of the element in the permutation that, when XORed with another element, yields the maximum possible value, i is n-1, v2 is n-1, prev is the index of the element that, when XORed with the element at index v1, yields the maximum possible value.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be such that `kp` will have reached the total number of test cases minus one, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For the current test case, `n` will be the length of the permutation, and `g` will remain 0 as it is not modified within the loop. `v1` will hold the index of the element that, when XORed with another element, results in the maximum possible value. `i` will be `n-1` after the final iteration of the inner loop, and `v2` will also be `n-1` from the last comparison. `prev` will hold the index of the element that, when XORed with the element at index `v1`, gives the maximum XOR value.
