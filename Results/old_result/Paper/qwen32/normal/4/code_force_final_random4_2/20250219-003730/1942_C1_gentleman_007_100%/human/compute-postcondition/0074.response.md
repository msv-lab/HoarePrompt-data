The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was either `len(a) - 2`, `len(a) - 3`, or `len(a) - 3`. After the decrement, `i` will be `len(a) - 3`, `len(a) - 4`, or `len(a) - 4`. The value of `j` remains unchanged, so it is still `len(b) - 3` or `len(b) - 2`. The list `l` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `a[:i]` and `b[:j]`. `i` is `len(a) - 3` or `len(a) - 4`. `j` is `len(b) - 3` or `len(b) - 2`. `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]` or `a[i + 1]`, and in some cases, it may contain both `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`.**
