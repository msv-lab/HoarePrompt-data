The code snippet `t = int(data[index])` converts the element at the `index` position of the `data` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `index` is 0, so `t` is assigned the integer value of the first element in the `data` list.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the split input values; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 0.**
