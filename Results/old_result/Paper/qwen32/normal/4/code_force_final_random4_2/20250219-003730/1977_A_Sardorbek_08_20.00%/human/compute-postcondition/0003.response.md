The code snippet `q = b, c` assigns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `c` to the variable `q`. The values of `b` and `c` are read from the input, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the variable `q` will hold a tuple of these two integers. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each of the following t lines contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` must be greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers read from the input; `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`**.
