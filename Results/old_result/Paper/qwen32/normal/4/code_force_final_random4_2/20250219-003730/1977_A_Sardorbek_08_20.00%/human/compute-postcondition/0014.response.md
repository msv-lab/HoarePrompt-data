Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each of the following t lines contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers read from the input; `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`. Additionally, `b` is not equal to `c` and `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. If `a % 2` equals `b % 2`, then the condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is false.**
