To determine what will be printed by the given print statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the variables involved.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `low` is `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is `p3 - p1`.
- `cur` is less than `high`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

Let's break down the expression `p1 - cur + p3`:
- `p1` is one of the integers between 0 and 30.
- `cur` is less than `high`, which is `p3 - p1`.
- `p3` is one of the integers between 0 and 30 and is greater than or equal to `p1` and `p2`.

Since `cur` is less than `high` and `high` is `p3 - p1`, the value of `cur` can range from 0 to `p3 - p1 - 1`.

The expression `p1 - cur + p3` can be simplified by considering the range of `cur`:
- When `cur` is at its minimum (0), `p1 - cur + p3` becomes `p1 + p3`.
- When `cur` is at its maximum (`p3 - p1 - 1`), `p1 - cur + p3` becomes `p1 - (p3 - p1 - 1) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p1 + 1 + p3 = 2 * p1 + 1`.

Therefore, the value of `p1 - cur + p3` will be some integer between `p1 + p3` and `2 * p1 + 1`, inclusive.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p3`, and `cur` are not specified, we can't determine a single numerical value for the output. However, we can describe the range of possible values.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3 (where p1 - cur + p3 is an integer between p1 + p3 and 2 * p1 + 1, inclusive)**
