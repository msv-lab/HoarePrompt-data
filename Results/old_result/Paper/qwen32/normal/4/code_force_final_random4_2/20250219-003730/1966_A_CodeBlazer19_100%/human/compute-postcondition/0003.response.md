The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `l`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is not adjusted before the loop starts, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
