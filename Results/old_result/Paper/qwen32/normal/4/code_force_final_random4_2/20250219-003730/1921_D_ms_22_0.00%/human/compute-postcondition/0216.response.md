The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes the smallest element from the `max_heap` (which is the largest element in terms of `max_diff` due to the negative sign) and assigns it to the variable `item`. The `max_heap` will have one less element after this operation.

Given that `max_heap` initially contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)`, after the `heappop` operation, `item` will hold this tuple, and `max_heap` will no longer contain this specific tuple.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` except the one that was popped; `item` is a tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`.**
