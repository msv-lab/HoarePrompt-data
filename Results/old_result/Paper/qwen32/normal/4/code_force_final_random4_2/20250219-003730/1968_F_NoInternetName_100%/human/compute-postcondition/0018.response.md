The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state provides information about the variables and objects involved in the program, but none of these details affect the output of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `x`, `inds`, `q`, `i`, `l`, `r`, or any other variable mentioned in the initial state.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `x` is a list that alternates between `0` and elements from another list `a` at even indices.
   - `inds` is a `defaultdict` where the key `0` maps to a list of even indices up to `2*floor(k/2)`, and each odd-indexed element `a[j]` maps to a list containing just `j`.
   - `q` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is initialized to `0`.
   - `l` and `r` are values returned by the function `func_1(int)`.
   - `x[l - 1]` is set to equal `x[r]`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('Yes')` statement is executed.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or objects described in the initial state, the output is simply the string `'Yes'`.

**Output: Yes**
