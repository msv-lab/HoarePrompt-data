Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 500`.
- `i` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` function is used to output values separated by spaces.
- The first value printed is `1`.
- The second value printed is `i`, which is `2`.
- The `*range(n, 0, -1)` part unpacks the range of numbers from `n` down to `1` and prints each number in the sequence.

### Detailed Breakdown:
- `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence starting from `n` and ending at `1` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.
- For example, if `n` is `5`, the sequence generated by `range(5, 0, -1)` would be `5, 4, 3, 2, 1`.
- The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so each number in the sequence is printed as a separate argument to the `print` function.

### Final Output:
- The output will start with `1` and `2`.
- This will be followed by the sequence of numbers from `n` down to `1`.

### Format the Final Output:
Output: **1, 2, n, n-1, ..., 1 (where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500)**
