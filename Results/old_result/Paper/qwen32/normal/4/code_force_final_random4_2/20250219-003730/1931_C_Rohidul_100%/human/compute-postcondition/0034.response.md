The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the list `a` will be updated based on the input provided, but other variables such as `t`, `n`, `le`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified later in the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers derived from the input; `le` is the length of the list `a`; `l` is the position right before the first element that is not equal to the previous one, or `le - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of the consecutive equal elements from the start, or `le` if all elements are equal; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the end of the list; if `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`; otherwise, `ans` is `le - max(st, end)`; `a` is updated to the list of integers from the input.**
