The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentioned the conditions on `n` and `m`, but the code only affects `n` and introduces `k`. Therefore, `m` remains unchanged, and `n` and `k` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **Each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6. The first line of the input contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). It is guaranteed that neither the sum of `n` nor the sum of `m` over all test cases exceeds 2 · 10^6. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input.**
