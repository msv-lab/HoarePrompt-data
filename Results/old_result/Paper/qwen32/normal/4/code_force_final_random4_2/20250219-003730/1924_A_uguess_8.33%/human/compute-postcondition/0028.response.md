Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input; `s` is a string read from the input that must have at least 1 character; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`; `cur_ss` is an integer representing the position of `ss` in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'). If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is updated to the previous value of `cur` plus \(2^{cur\_ss}\). Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. If `cur` was equal to \((1 << k) - 1\), then `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `cur` retains its updated value.**
