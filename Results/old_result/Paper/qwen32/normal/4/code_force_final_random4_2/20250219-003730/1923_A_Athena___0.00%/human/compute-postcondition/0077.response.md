The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that `a` is not empty and ends with `0`, after executing `a.pop()`, the last element `0` will be removed from the list. Therefore, `a` will no longer end with `0`, but it will still be not empty unless it had only one element, which was `0`.

Output State: **`a` is not empty (unless it originally only contained `0`), and `a` does not end with `0`**.
