Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`.**

Natural Language: The value of `totalOne` is set to the number of elements in the list `pre`, which represents the count of '>' characters in the string `s1`. The values of `s1` and `pre` remain unchanged.
