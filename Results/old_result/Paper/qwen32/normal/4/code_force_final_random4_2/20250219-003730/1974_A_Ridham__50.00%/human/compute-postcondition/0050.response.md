To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the impact of the code snippet on the existing variables. The code snippet provided is:

```
extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
```

Let's break down the variables involved:

- `space_x` is already defined as `x`.
- `remaining_cells` is defined based on the value of `y`:
  - If `y` is even, `remaining_cells = 15 * (y // 2) - y * 4`.
  - If `y` is odd, `remaining_cells = 15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4`.

The new variable `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.

Given this information, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even or `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd, `result` is a list containing two elements, the second element being `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.**

In natural language, this means:
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000.
- `x` and `y` retain their input values.
- `n` is one less than its previous value.
- `space_x` remains equal to `x`.
- `space_y` remains equal to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` remains equal to `space_y + space_x`.
- `screen_require_for_y` remains calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
- `remaining_cells` remains calculated as `15 * (y // 2) - y * 4` if `y` is even or `15 * (y // 2 + 1) - y * 4` if `y` is odd.
- `result` remains a list with its second element being `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions.
- `extra_space` is now calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.
