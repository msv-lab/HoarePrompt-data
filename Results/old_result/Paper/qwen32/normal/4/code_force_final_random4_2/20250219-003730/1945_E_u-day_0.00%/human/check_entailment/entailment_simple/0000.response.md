### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and match it against the problem description and the annotated states.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `x` followed by the permutation `p`.
   - This is correctly handled by `func_1()` and `func_2()`.

2. **Finding the Position of `x`**:
   - The program iterates through the permutation to find the index `pos` of the value `x`.
   - This is correctly done in the loop `for i in range(n):`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   - The program simulates a binary search on the permutation to find the value `x`.
   - It initializes `low` and `high` to `0` and `n-1` respectively.
   - In each iteration of the loop, it calculates `mid` and adjusts `low` or `high` based on the value at `mid`.

4. **Determining the Number of Swaps**:
   - If `arr[low]` equals `x`, it prints `0` since no swaps are needed.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` and suggests swapping `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]`.

### Issues in the Code:
- The code does not correctly handle the requirement of using up to 2 swaps to make `arr[low]` equal to `x` after the binary search.
- The code only considers swapping `arr[low]` with `arr[pos]` if `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, but it does not ensure that `arr[low]` will be equal to `x` after the swap.
- The binary search simulation does not take into account the possibility of making two strategic swaps to achieve the desired result.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not ensure that after up to 2 swaps, the binary search will result in `arr[low]` being equal to `x`.

**Correctness: False**
