Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, and `i` is either 0 or 1. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is True. If `i` is 0 and `work` is True, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is 1 and `work` is True, `ans` remains the first character of `a`, and `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`.**
