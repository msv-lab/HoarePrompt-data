To determine the output, let's break down the given information and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is 0.
- `r` is a list containing the results of all test cases.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*r, sep='\n')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` function in Python can take multiple arguments, and the `*r` syntax unpacks the list `r` into individual arguments.
- The `sep='\n'` argument specifies that each item in the unpacked list should be separated by a newline character when printed.

### Output Determination:
- Since `r` is a list containing the results of all test cases, the `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line.
- The exact values of the elements in `r` are not provided, but we know that each element will be printed on a separate line.

### Final Output:
Output: **Each element of the list `r` printed on a new line (where `r` is a list containing the results of all test cases)**
