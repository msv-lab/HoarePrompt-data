The code snippet calculates the value of `extra_screen` based on the value of `extra_space`. The value of `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `space_x` is not a multiple of 15.
- `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

The new variable `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1`.

Since `space_x` is not a multiple of 15, `extra_space` will not be a multiple of 15 either, and adding 1 to `extra_space // 15` ensures that `extra_screen` accounts for the remaining space that does not fully fit into a block of 15.

The output state will include the updated value of `extra_screen`, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is an empty list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`, and `space_x` is not a multiple of 15.**
