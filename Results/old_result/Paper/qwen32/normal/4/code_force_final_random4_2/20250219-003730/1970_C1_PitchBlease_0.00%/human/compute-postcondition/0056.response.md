Output State: **`queue` is empty, `visited` contains all reachable nodes from `start`, `current` is the last node processed before the queue became empty, and `dist` is the distance from `start` to `current`. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns `dist`. Otherwise, the function has finished processing all reachable nodes without finding the target.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop, the queue will be empty because all possible nodes have been processed. The `visited` set will include all nodes that are reachable from the starting node. The `current` variable will hold the last node that was processed, and `dist` will reflect the distance from the starting node to this last processed node. If the last processed node (`current`) is the target node, the function would return the distance (`dist`). If the loop completes without finding the target, it means all reachable nodes have been processed, and the target is not reachable from the start.
