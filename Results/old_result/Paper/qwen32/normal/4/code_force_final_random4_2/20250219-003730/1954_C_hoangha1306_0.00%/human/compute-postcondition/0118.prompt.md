Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is the new input string; `b` is the new input string; `kq1` is an empty string; `kq2` is an empty string; `vt` is 0; `q` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0. If the characters at index `i` of `a` and `b` are equal, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`. If the characters at index `i` of `a` and `b` are not equal, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`. If `vt` was 0, `vt` is now 1, and `kq1` is `str(y)` and `kq2` is `str(x)` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is `str(x)` and `kq2` is `str(y)`. If `vt` was not 0, `kq1` is `str(y)` and `kq2` is `str(x)` regardless of the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each updated to include the character at index 1 of string `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`. If `vt` was 0, `vt` is now 1. `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with `a[2]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[2]` and `b[2]`, and if `vt` was originally 0, it is set to 1. In both cases, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
