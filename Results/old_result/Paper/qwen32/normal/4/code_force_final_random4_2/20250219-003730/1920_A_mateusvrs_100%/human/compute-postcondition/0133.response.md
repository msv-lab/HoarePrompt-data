The only object in the loop head is the variable `i` and the set `cx`. For the loop to execute, `cx` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over `cx`. The current state specifies that `cx` is a set containing all `x` where `a` is neither 1 nor 2, but there is no information that guarantees `cx` is non-empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `cx` has at least one element.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 2, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is 0, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` where `a` is 1, `cx` is a set containing at least one element (e.g., `cx` contains `x` where `a` is neither 1 nor 2 and there is at least one such `x`), `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 0**
