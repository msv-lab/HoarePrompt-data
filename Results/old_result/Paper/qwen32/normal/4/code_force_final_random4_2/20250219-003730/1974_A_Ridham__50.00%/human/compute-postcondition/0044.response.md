The code snippet provided is:
```
total_space = space_y + space_x
```

This line of code reassigned the value of `total_space` to be the sum of `space_y` and `space_x`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `space_x`, `space_y`, `remaining_cells`, and `screen_require_for_y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `result` is a list containing two elements, the second element being `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions.**
