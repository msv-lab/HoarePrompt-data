Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is defined as \( n - 1 \).

### Python Code:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
1. **`'1 %d' % i`**:
   - This part of the code is a string formatting operation.
   - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
   - `i` is the value that will replace the `%d` placeholder.
   - Given that `i` is \( n - 1 \), the string will be formatted to `'1 [n-1]'`.

2. **`*range(1, n + 1)`**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence so that each number is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
   - This means that the numbers from 1 to `n` will be printed, separated by spaces.

### Combining the Two Parts:
- The first part `'1 %d' % i` will print the string `'1 [n-1]'`.
- The second part `*range(1, n + 1)` will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
- The final output will be a combination of the string `'1 [n-1]'` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, each separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the code, the output of the `print` statement can be described as follows:

Output: **1 [n-1] 1 2 3 ... n (where [n-1] is the value of n-1 and the sequence 1 2 3 ... n represents numbers from 1 to n inclusive)**
