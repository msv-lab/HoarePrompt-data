The `print(2)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `m` as described in the initial state. The print statement directly outputs the integer `2`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print(2)` statement explicitly outputs the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the number `2`.

Output: **2**
