You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input for a single test case consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and adds to it the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from `2` to the square root of `n` rounded up. The result is then printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis

The provided program does not appear to implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (note: the variable `k` should be `m` according to the problem description).
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it.
   - It iterates from 2 to the square root of \(n\) (inclusive).
   - For each iteration, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \times i\) and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Variable Naming**:
   - The problem specifies \(m\) but the program uses \(k\). This is a minor issue and can be fixed by renaming `k` to `m`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not match the problem's requirements. The program is calculating something related to divisors and sums but does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Lack of Condition Checking**:
   - The program does not check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) for any pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) holds. This can be computationally expensive for large \(n\) and \(m\), so optimizations or alternative approaches might be necessary.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect as it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
