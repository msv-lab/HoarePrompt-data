### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment to ensure correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The operations allowed are:
1. Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and fill it with a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).

The optimal strategy is to fill each row and each column with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)]. This is because the highest numbers should be placed as many times as possible in the matrix, and this permutation achieves this by placing the highest number \( n \) in every row and column.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \). It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and the number of operations needed. The maximum sum can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \]
This formula is derived from the fact that each row and each column will be filled with numbers from 1 to \( n \), and the total sum will be the sum of these numbers repeated \( n \) times for rows and \( n \) times for columns minus the overlap (since the diagonal elements are counted twice).

The program then outputs this maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \) (one operation for each row and one operation for each column).

The operations are described as follows:
- For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)].
- For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), perform a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)].

#### Verification Using Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6} \).
- It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \).
- It then prints the operations: for each row and each column, it applies the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)].

The annotations confirm that the program correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the operations as intended.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve this sum. The operations described ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation [\( n, n-1, \ldots, 1 \)], which is the optimal strategy to maximize the sum of the matrix.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final: **True**
