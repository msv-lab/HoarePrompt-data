Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `r` must be at least `l + 2`; `mid` is the integer value `(l + r) // 2`.**

Natural Language: The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. The other variables, `array`, `find`, `l`, and `r`, remain unchanged.
