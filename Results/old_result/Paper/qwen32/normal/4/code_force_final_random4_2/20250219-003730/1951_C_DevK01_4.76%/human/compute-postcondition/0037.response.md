To determine the output of the `print(cost)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the conditions that define the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t` is set to `t - 1`, but this does not affect the `cost` calculation directly.
   - `m` is set to `min(m, k)`, but `m` is later redefined as `L[1]`.
   - `k` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
   - `L` is a list of integers obtained from new input.
   - `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from new input.
   - `n` is the length of `N`.
   - `m` is redefined as `L[1]`.
   - `k` is redefined as `L[2]`.
   - `q` is calculated as `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.

2. **Conditions for Calculating `N` and `cost`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q-1]` excluding the last element that was popped, and `cost` is calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `w` is the last element that was popped from `N`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation of `cost`:
1. **Determine `m` and `k`:**
   - `m` is the second element of the list `L`.
   - `k` is the third element of the list `L`.

2. **Calculate `q`:**
   - `q` is the ceiling of `k / m`.

3. **Determine `N`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
   - Otherwise, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of the sorted list `M`, excluding the last element that was popped.

4. **Calculate `cost`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`, where `w` is the last element that was popped from `N`, and `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.

### Final Output:
The `print(cost)` statement will print the calculated `cost` based on the conditions and values derived from the input lists `L` and `M`.

Since the exact values of `L` and `M` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `cost`.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions and values derived from the input lists `L` and `M`)**
