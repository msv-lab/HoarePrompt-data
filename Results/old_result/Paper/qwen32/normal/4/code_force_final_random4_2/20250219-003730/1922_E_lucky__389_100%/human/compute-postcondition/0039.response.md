Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is a non-zero integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list. If `i` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - 2` and `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i - 1`.**
