Output State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which the user input `r` was `<` or `0` if no such input was received, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `r` is `'>'`.**

In simple terms, the value of `prev` has been updated to be equal to `i`, which is `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
