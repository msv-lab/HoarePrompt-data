The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting `a[i] * 2` from it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is sorted in descending order.
- `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `4 * a[i]`.
- `ans2` is the value of `ans1` after `k-1` iterations.
- `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`.
- `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input.
- `t` is decremented by 1.
- `x` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

After the execution of the code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2`, the value of `ans1` changes. The new value of `ans1` is the previous value of `ans1` minus `a[i] * 2`.

Output State: **`a` is sorted in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `4 * a[i]` minus `a[i] * 2`; `ans2` is the value of `ans1` after `k-1` iterations; `ans` is the maximum of the final `ans1` and `ans2`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input; `t` is decremented by 1; `x` must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
