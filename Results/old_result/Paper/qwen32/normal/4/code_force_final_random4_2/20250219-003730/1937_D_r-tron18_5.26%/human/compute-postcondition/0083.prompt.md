Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`, `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing a single element, `0` if `el` is '>', otherwise it contains elements `[0, i + 1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne` plus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `totalOne`; `zr` is `-1` if `el` is '>', otherwise it is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `0` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise it is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` if `el` is not '>', otherwise it is `i + 1`; `oneInd` is `2 - x` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>', otherwise it is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` if `el` is not '>', otherwise it is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`; `fi` is `0` if `ol` > `zr` and `el` is '>'. If `el` is not '>', `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is updated based on the value of `el` where it is reduced by 1 if `el` is '>'; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, and the last element is removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing elements that are accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided. If `el` is '>', `preOne` has its last element removed, and `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` if `ol <= zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`. If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is updated by adding `i + 1`, and `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd`. `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` and `zr` are updated based on the value of `el` and the conditions provided; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`; `fi` is calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, and `preOne`. `i` is `k - 1`; `el` is `s1[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is updated based on the value of `el` where it is reduced by 1 if `el` is '>'; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, and the last element is removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing elements that are accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<', with the latest element being `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `el` is '>', `totalOne` is reduced by 1 and the last element of `preOne` is removed. If `el` is '<', `suffZero` is updated by adding `i + 1` to its last element. If `zr <= ol`, `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd` where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
