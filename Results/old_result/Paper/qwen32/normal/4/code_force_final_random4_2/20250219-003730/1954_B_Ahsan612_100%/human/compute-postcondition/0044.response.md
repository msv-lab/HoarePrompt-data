Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of `ar`. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` retains its value. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`. The loop is about to start its next iteration, which means `int(input())` has not yet decremented the iteration count.**

Natural language: The variable `num` has been updated to be the first element of the list `ar`. All other variables retain their previous values.
