The code calculates the integer square root of `n` and adds 1 to it, then assigns this value to the variable `root`.

Given that `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `ans` is initially assigned the value of `n`, the value of `root` after the code execution will be `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

Output State: **Each test case contains two positive integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2 · 10^6. The first line of the input contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). It is guaranteed that neither the sum of `n` nor the sum of `m` over all test cases exceeds 2 · 10^6. `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input. `ans` is assigned the value of `n`. `root` is assigned the value of `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.**
