The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element of `a` is 0, executing `a.pop()` will remove this 0 from the list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list with at least one element (excluding the removed 0), `res` is 0.**
