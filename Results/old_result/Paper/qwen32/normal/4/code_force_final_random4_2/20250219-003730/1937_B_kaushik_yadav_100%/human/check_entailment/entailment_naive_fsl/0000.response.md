Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the grasshopper has to choose between two equal cells. The logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths is flawed in some scenarios.

Let's analyze the provided code and find a counterexample:

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Path Construction**:
   - The code iterates through the columns and at each step, it checks if it can switch rows to get a lexicographically smaller number.
   - If the current cell in row 1 is smaller than the next cell in row 1, it stays in row 1.
   - If the current cell in row 2 is smaller than the next cell in row 1, it switches to row 2.
   - If the current cell in row 2 is smaller than the current cell in row 1, it switches to row 2.
   - If the current cell in row 1 is the same as the next cell in row 1, it stays in row 1.

2. **Path Counting**:
   - The code counts the number of paths that yield the smallest string by checking if the next cell in row 1 is equal to the current cell in row 2.
   - If the next cell in row 1 is '0' and the current cell in row 2 is '1', it resets the counter.
   - Otherwise, it increments the counter.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1101
1001
```
**Expected Output:**
```
10001
3
```
**Explanation:**
- The lexicographically smallest string is `10001` which can be obtained by the paths: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) and (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,4) and (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (1,4).

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
1001
1
```
**Explanation:**
- The code incorrectly constructs the string `1001` and counts only one path.

### Conclusion:
The code fails to correctly handle scenarios where the grasshopper can stay in the same row or switch rows to achieve the lexicographically smallest string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
