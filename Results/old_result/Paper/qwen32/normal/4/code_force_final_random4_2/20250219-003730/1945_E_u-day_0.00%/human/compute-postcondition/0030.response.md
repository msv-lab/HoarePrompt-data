To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop: `low + 1 < high`. This means that for the loop to execute again, the difference between `high` and `low` must be at least 2.

Given the possible values for `low` and `high`:
- `low` can be either 0 or `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `high` can be either `(n - 1) // 2` or `n - 1`.

Let's analyze the possible combinations:

1. If `low` is 0 and `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`, then `low + 1 < high` becomes `1 < (n - 1) // 2`. This implies that `(n - 1) // 2` must be at least 2, meaning `n - 1` must be at least 4, so `n` must be at least 5.
2. If `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`, then `low + 1 < high` becomes `1 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `n > 2`. Since `n` must be greater than 3 (as given), this condition is already satisfied.
3. If `low` is `(n - 1) // 2` and `high` is `n - 1`, then `low + 1 < high` becomes `((n - 1) // 2) + 1 < n - 1`. This simplifies to `((n - 1) // 2) < n - 2`. This condition is generally true for `n` greater than 3, as `(n - 1) // 2` will be less than `n - 2` for `n > 3`.

From the above analysis, the condition `low + 1 < high` is satisfied if `n` is greater than 3 and `low` and `high` are set such that their difference is at least 2. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that `low` and `high` are set to values that satisfy this condition.

Since `n` is already given to be greater than 3, we need to ensure that `low` and `high` are set to values that make `low + 1 < high` true. The simplest way to ensure this is to set `low` to 0 and `high` to `n - 1`, which is already given as a possible value for `high`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is either `(n - 1) // 4` or `(n - 1) // 2` or `n // 2`, and `st` contains `mid`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.**
