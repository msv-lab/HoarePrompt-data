Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes `s1` to the desired state `s2`. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to move cats between boxes, add new cats, or remove existing ones.

To solve the problem, we need to count the number of cats that need to be added and the number that need to be removed. The total number of operations will be the sum of these two counts because we can independently add and remove cats without affecting each other.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n: int, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    add_count = 0
    remove_count = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
            remove_count += 1
        elif s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1':
            add_count += 1
    
    return add_count + remove_count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))
```

This function correctly calculates the minimum number of operations by counting the number of cats that need to be added and removed separately and then summing these counts.
