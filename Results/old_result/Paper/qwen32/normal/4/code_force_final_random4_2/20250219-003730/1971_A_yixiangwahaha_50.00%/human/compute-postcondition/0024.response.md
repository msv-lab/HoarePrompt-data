To determine the output of the given print statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: A string representing the input value.
2. **`x`**: A list containing ten integers.
3. **`y`**: A list containing ten integers.
4. **`i`**: An integer with a value of 1.
5. **`xylist`**: A list of strings obtained from splitting the input string `t` by spaces for the last iteration.
6. **Condition**: If `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, then `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`. Otherwise, `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
```

### Analysis:
- Since `i` is explicitly set to 1, the print statement will output the elements at index 1 of the lists `y` and `x`.
- The exact values of `x[1]` and `y[1]` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their specific numerical values.
- However, we know the structure of the output will be `y[1]` followed by a space and then `x[1]`.

### Output:
The code will print the value of `y[1]`, followed by a space, and then the value of `x[1]`.

Output: **y[1]  x[1] (where y[1] is the second element of the list y and x[1] is the second element of the list x)**
