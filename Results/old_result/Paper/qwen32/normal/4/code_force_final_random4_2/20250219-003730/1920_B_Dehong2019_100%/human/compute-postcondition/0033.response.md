The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `x`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` will be updated based on the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `i`, `ans2`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `x` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop.**
