To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ansv))` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state provided and deduce the value of `ansv` step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding `subseq_lens`**:
   - `subseq_lens` is a list of integers representing the powers of 2 subtracted from `X` in descending order.
   - Since `X` is an integer such that \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\), `subseq_lens` will contain the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X`, and subsequent powers of 2 that sum up to `X` when subtracted from the previous values.

2. **Understanding `mx`**:
   - `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, which is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X`.

3. **Understanding `ansv`**:
   - `ansv` is a list constructed in two parts:
     1. A list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1`.
     2. All elements of `subseq_lens` from the second element to the last element.

Let's break down the construction of `ansv` with an example:

### Example Calculation:

Assume `X = 13` (a simple example to illustrate the process):

- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 13 is 8, so the first element of `subseq_lens` is 8.
- Subtracting 8 from 13 leaves 5.
- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 5 is 4, so the next element of `subseq_lens` is 4.
- Subtracting 4 from 5 leaves 1.
- The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1 is 1, so the last element of `subseq_lens` is 1.
- Therefore, `subseq_lens = [8, 4, 1]`.

- `mx` is the maximum of `subseq_lens`, which is 8.
- The first part of `ansv` is the list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1`, i.e., `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
- The second part of `ansv` is all elements of `subseq_lens` from the second element to the last element, i.e., `[4, 1]`.

Thus, `ansv` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 4, 1]`.

### General Formula:

- The length of the first part of `ansv` (from 0 to `mx - 1`) is `mx`.
- The length of the second part of `ansv` (elements of `subseq_lens` from the second element to the last element) is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

Therefore, the total length of `ansv` is:
\[ \text{len(ansv)} = mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1) \]

### Conclusion:

- `mx` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X`.
- `len(subseq_lens)` is the number of powers of 2 needed to sum up to `X`.

Since `mx` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X`, and `len(subseq_lens)` is the number of terms in the binary representation of `X`, we can deduce that:
\[ \text{len(ansv)} = mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1) \]

However, without the exact value of `X`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ansv)`. But we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **len(ansv) (where len(ansv) is the length of the list ansv constructed as described)**
