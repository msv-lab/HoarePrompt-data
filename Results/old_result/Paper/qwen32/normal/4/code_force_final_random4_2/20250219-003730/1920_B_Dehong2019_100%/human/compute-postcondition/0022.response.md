The code snippet provided modifies the value of `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of the element at index `i + x` in the list `a`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer read from input
- `n` is an integer read from input
- `k` is greater than 0
- `x` is greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order
- `i` is initially set to `x`
- `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`
- `ans1` is initially `ans1 + a[x]`

The operation `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` modifies `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from it.

Since `i` is initially set to `x`, the operation becomes `ans1 -= a[x + x] * 2`, which simplifies to `ans1 -= a[2 * x] * 2`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * a[2 * x]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x`, `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`, `ans1` is `ans1 - 2 * a[2 * x]`**
