Output State: **`t` is still an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `x` and `y` are still integers provided by the input; `n` is still an integer greater than 0; `result` is still a list containing one element; `space_x` is still equal to `x`; `space_y` is still equal to `y * 4`; `total_space` is still equal to `space_y + space_x`; `remaining_cells` is still equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`; `extra_space` is now equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`; `extra_screen` is now equal to `space_x // 15`; If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is still equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is still equal to `y // 2 + 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `extra_screen` is now calculated as `space_x // 15`, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
