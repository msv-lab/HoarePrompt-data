To determine the output state, we need to focus on the specific change made by the line `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. This line updates the value of `zeroInd` based on the result of the function `func_1` applied to `suffZero` and `ol`. 

Given the initial state, we know:
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`.
- `totalOne` is updated based on the value of `el` where it is reduced by 1 if `el` is '>'.
- `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, and the last element is removed if `el` is '>'.
- `suffZero` is a list containing elements that are accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<'.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'.
- `ol` is `totalOne`.
- `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.
- `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`.
- `fi` is calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, and `preOne`.
- `i` is `k - 2`.
- `el` is `s1[i]`.

The code snippet provided updates `zeroInd` specifically. Since `func_1` is not defined, we can only express `zeroInd` in terms of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is updated based on the value of `el` where it is reduced by 1 if `el` is '>'; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, and the last element is removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing elements that are accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` is greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`; `oneInd` is calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`; `fi` is calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, and `preOne`; `i` is `k - 2`; `el` is `s1[i]`.**
