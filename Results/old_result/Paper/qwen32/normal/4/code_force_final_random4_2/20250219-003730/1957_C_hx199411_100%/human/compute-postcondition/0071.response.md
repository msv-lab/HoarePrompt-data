Postcondition: **`t` is falsy, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 1 (and `m` is not equal to 0), `dp` is [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937], `i` is `k`, `num` is the sum of increments based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` in each iteration.**
