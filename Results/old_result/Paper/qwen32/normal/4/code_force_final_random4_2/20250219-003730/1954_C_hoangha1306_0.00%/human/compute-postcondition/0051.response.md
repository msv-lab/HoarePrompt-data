The code appends the string representation of `y` to `kq1`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `vt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `min(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i-1]), int(b[i-1]))`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is `kq1` + str(y)**.
