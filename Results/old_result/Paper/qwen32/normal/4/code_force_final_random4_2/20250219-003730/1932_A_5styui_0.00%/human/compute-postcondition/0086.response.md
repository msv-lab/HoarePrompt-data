The `break` statement will terminate the current loop, but it does not affect the values of the variables outside of the loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `path`, `a`, `d`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop execution is stopped, and the control moves out of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.', `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is the length of `b` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks, `s` is 0, and `b[j]` is '*'. The character at position `j + 1` in `b` is '*' and the loop has been terminated.**
