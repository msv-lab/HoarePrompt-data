The given code snippet modifies the value of `ax` by taking the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. However, the initial value of `ax` is not provided in the initial state. Assuming `ax` is defined and has a value, the code will update `ax` to be the smaller of `x` and `ax`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, then `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is not equal to 1 or 2, then `cx` is a set containing `x`. `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`.**
