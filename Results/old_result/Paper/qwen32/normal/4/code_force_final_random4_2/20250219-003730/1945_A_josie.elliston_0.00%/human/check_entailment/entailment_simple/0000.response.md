### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the program to understand if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Introverts**: Each introvert requires a tent for themselves.
2. **Extroverts**: Each extrovert must share a tent with exactly two others.
3. **Universals**: Universals can be placed in any configuration (alone, with one other, or with two others).

Given these conditions, the program's logic is as follows:
- **`func_1`**: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. It ensures that extroverts are always placed in groups of three. If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of three, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form a tent.
  - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of three (`extroverts % 3 != 0`), it checks if the remaining extroverts plus the universals can form at least one more tent (`extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`). If not, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals by taking the ceiling of the sum of extroverts and universals divided by three.
- **`func_2`**: This function calculates the total number of tents required. It first calls `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone. Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (which is equal to the number of introverts, since each introvert needs a tent for themselves) to the result from `func_1`.

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the logic with a few test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 2 3`
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 2, Universals: 3
   - `func_1(2, 3)`:
     - `2 % 3 != 0` and `2 % 3 + 3 >= 3` is true.
     - Calculate tents: `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = ceil(5 / 3) = 2`
   - `func_2(1, 2, 3)`:
     - `ret = 2`
     - Return `1 + 2 = 3`
   - **Output**: `3` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `1 4 1`
   - Introverts: 1, Extroverts: 4, Universals: 1
   - `func_1(4, 1)`:
     - `4 % 3 != 0` and `4 % 3 + 1 < 3` is true.
     - Return `None`
   - `func_2(1, 4, 1)`:
     - `ret = None`
     - Return `-1`
   - **Output**: `-1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `0 0 0`
   - Introverts: 0, Extroverts: 0, Universals: 0
   - `func_1(0, 0)`:
     - `0 % 3 == 0`, calculate tents: `ceil((0 + 0) / 3) = 0`
   - `func_2(0, 0, 0)`:
     - `ret = 0`
     - Return `0 + 0 = 0`
   - **Output**: `0` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Introverts: 1000000000, Extroverts: 1000000000, Universals: 1000000000
   - `func_1(1000000000, 1000000000)`:
     - `1000000000 % 3 != 0` and `1000000000 % 3 + 1000000000 >= 3` is true.
     - Calculate tents: `ceil((1000000000 + 1000000000) / 3) = ceil(2000000000 / 3) = 666666667`
   - `func_2(1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)`:
     - `ret = 666666667`
     - Return `1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667`
   - **Output**: `1666666667` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed or determines if it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
