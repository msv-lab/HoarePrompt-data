The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` adds `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss` to `cur`. Here, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. Therefore, the value of `cur` will be incremented by `2` raised to the power of the position of `ss` in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, and so on).

Let's break down the changes:
- `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss`.
- `cur` is reset to `0` if `cur` was equal to `(1 << k) - 1` before the increment, otherwise `cur` remains the incremented value.
- `cnt` is set to `2` if `cur` was reset to `0` (meaning it was previously `(1 << k) - 1`), otherwise `cnt` is set to `1`.
- `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, and `cur_ss` is recalculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` unless it was `(1 << k) - 1` before the increment, in which case `cur` is `0`; `cnt` is `2` if `cur` was reset to `0`, otherwise `cnt` is `1`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`; `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.**
