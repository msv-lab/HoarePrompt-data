The code snippet reads two integers from the user's input and assigns them to the variables `b` and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `d`, `e`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is the first integer from the user's input, `c` is the second integer from the user's input, `d` is the new input string, `e` is the value of the user's input, `i` is 4, `j` is the last index processed before the loop breaks, and `k` is the value it held when the loop breaks.**
