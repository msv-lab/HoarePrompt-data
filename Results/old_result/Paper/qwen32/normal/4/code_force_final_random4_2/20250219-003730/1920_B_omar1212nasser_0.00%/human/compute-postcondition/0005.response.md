The code calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the `elements` list and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `removals`, `elements`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of the `elements` list, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the `elements` list.**
