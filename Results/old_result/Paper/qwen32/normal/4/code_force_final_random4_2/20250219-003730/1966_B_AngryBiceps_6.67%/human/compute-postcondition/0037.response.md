Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements (the first element is the result of the first `input()`, and the second element is the result of the second `input()`), `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a` (which was the first element before the append), `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` (which was the first element before the append), `i` is 0**

Explanation: The list `a` now contains two elements, where the second element is the result of the second `input()`. The variables `first_row` and `last_row` still refer to the first and last characters of the first element in the list `a`, as the code does not update these variables. The other variables remain unchanged.
