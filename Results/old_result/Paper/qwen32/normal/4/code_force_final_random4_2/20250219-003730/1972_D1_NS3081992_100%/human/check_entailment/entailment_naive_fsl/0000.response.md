Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not directly implement the required logic to solve the problem described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

The code provided includes several utility functions (func_1 to func_16) that perform various tasks such as reading input, computing the greatest common divisor (gcd), and other operations, but the specific logic to solve the problem is not clearly present.

The function `func_15` seems to be the main function that attempts to solve the problem, but it does not correctly implement the required logic. The loop inside `func_15` calculates a sum based on the condition, but it does not correctly account for all pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given condition.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the first example provided in the problem description:

- For n = 1 and m = 1, the only pair is (1, 1). Here, a + b = 2 and b * gcd(a, b) = 1. Since 2 is a multiple of 1, the pair (1, 1) satisfies the condition. The function should return 1.

- For n = 2 and m = 3, the pairs that satisfy the condition are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2). The function should return 3.

However, the function `func_15` does not correctly compute these results for these test cases or others. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To make the program correct, the logic inside `func_15` needs to be revised to properly iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and count those that satisfy the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
