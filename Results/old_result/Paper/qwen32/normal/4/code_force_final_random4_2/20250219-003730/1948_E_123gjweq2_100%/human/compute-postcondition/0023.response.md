To determine the final state after all iterations of the given loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the array `arr` and the list `cliquess`. The loop iterates `not_mid` times, where `not_mid` is calculated as \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\).

From the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can observe the following:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is initialized to `(left + 1) + i` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\).
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is initialized to `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - In each iteration \(i\) (where \(i\) ranges from 0 to `not_mid - 1`), the loop sets:
     - `arr[left + mid + i]` to `big_element - i`.
     - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to `clique`.

Given that the loop executes `not_mid` times, after all iterations, the values in `arr` and `cliquess` will be fully populated according to the loop's logic.

### Final Output State:
- `left` and `right` remain the same.
- `clique` remains the same.
- `small_element` remains `left + 1`.
- `big_element` remains `right + 1`.
- `mid` remains \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\).
- `not_mid` remains \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\).
- `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` will be `(left + 1) + i` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\).
- `cliquess[left + i]` will be `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\).
- `arr[left + mid + i]` will be `big_element - i` for \(i = 0\) to `not_mid - 1`.
- `cliquess[left + mid + i]` will be `clique` for \(i = 0\) to `not_mid - 1`.

### Natural Language Description:
After all iterations of the loop, the array `arr` will have its first `mid` elements set to increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the next `not_mid` elements set to decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. The list `cliquess` will have all elements from index `left` to `right` set to the value of `clique`.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\), `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid + not_mid - 1\), `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for \(i = 0\) to `not_mid - 1`, `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to `not_mid - 1`.**
