The code calculates the value of `cost` based on the given formula and updates the `cost` variable. The other variables remain unchanged or are not affected by this code snippet.

The formula for `cost` is:
\[ \text{cost} = m \times \text{sum}(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) \]

Given that:
- `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.
- `t` is `t`.
- `n` is `len(N)`.
- `m` is `min(m, k)`.
- `k` is `k`.
- `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
- `N` is `M[:q]`.

The value of `cost` is calculated and assigned to the variable `cost`.

Output State: **`M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `t` is `t`; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `k`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`**.
