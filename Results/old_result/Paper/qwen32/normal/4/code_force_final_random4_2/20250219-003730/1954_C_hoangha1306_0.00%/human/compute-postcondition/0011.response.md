Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `kq1` is the `i`th character of `a`, `kq2` is the `i`th character of `a`, `vt` is 0, and the `i`th character of `a` is equal to the `i`th character of `b`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no other changes to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
