The value of `ans2` is assigned the value of `ans1`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input split as integers; `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input in descending order; `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`; `ans2` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a`.
