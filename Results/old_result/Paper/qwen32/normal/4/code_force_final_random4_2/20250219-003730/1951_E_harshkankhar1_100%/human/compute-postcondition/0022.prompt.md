Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if s[i] != s[0]:
        x = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string and is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is `i` if the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the first character of `s`, otherwise `x` remains -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the first character of `s`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string and is greater than or equal to 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the first character of `s`, then `x` is set to `i` and the loop or if statement is broken. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1. `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, then `x` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `x` and we do not break out of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
