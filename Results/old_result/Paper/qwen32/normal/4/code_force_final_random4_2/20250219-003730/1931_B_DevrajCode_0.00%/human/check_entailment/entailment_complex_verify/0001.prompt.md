You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

import sys

data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])

- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, the sum of a_i is divisible by n, and `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`. Additionally, `total_water` is divisible by `n`.
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: container is 0.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It checks if the sum of the elements in `a` is divisible by `n` and if it's possible to distribute the elements in `a` such that each element is equal to the average of the sum of `a` divided by `n` without any element going below zero during the distribution process. If both conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

**Problem Understanding:**
- We are given `n` containers of water, each with an initial amount of water.
- The sum of all water in the containers is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
- The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

**Key Insight:**
- The sum of all water is divisible by `n`, so there exists a target amount `target = total_water // n` such that each container should ideally have `target` units of water.
- To achieve this, we need to ensure that at any point during the process of pouring water, we do not end up with a negative amount of water in any container. If we can pour water from left to right without ever dipping below zero, it means we can achieve the desired distribution.

**Code Analysis:**
- The code first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount each container should have.
- It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running sum (`container`) that represents the net amount of water that would be left if we were to pour water from left to right to achieve the target.
- If at any point this running sum becomes negative, it means we cannot achieve the desired distribution, and the function returns 'No'.
- If the loop completes without the running sum going negative, it returns 'Yes'.

**Correctness of the Code:**
- The code correctly implements the key insight mentioned above.
- It checks if it's possible to pour water from left to right without ever having a negative amount of water, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the problem.
- The code handles the input as described and outputs the correct result based on the logic.

Therefore, the provided code is correct.

**Final Answer:**
Reasoning: The code correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the given operation.
Correctness: **True**
