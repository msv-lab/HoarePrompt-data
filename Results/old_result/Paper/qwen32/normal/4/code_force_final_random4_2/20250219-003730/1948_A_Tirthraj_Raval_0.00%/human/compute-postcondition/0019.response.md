Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, nothing additional happens to `pattern`. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing `n` characters, alternating between 'A' and 'B', starting with 'A' if `n // 2` is odd and starting with 'B' if `n // 2` is even.**
