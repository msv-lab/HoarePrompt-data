The code snippet assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to the variable `tmp`. Given that `i` is the index of a bit in `cur` and the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, the value of `i` is a non-negative integer. The expression `ord('a') + i` converts the integer `i` to the corresponding ASCII value starting from 'a'. For example, if `i` is 0, `tmp` becomes 'a'; if `i` is 1, `tmp` becomes 'b', and so on.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, and the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0; `tmp` is the character corresponding to `chr(ord('a') + i)`**.
