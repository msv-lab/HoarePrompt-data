The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `coord` is an empty list; `res` is 0; `i` is the loop variable controlled by `range(4)`; `x` and `y` are integers read from the input.**
