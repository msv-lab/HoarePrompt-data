The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `b` and `c`. This means the values of `b` and `c` will be updated based on the input, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each of the following t lines contains two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, `a` is greater than or equal to 1; `b` and `c` are integers read from the input; `q` is a tuple `(b, c)`. If `b` equals `c`, then `b` is equal to `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `c`, and if `b` is less than `c`, then `b` is less than `c`. If `b` is greater than or equal to `c`, then `b` is greater than or equal to `c`. Additionally, if `a % 2` equals `b % 2`, the condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is true. Otherwise, the condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is false. `i` is 4; `b` and `c` are integers read from the input.**
