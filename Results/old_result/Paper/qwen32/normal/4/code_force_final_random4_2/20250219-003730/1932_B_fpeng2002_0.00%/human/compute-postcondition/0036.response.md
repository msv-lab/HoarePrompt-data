The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range parameters (0 and `len(nums)`). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. If `x` is less than `len(nums)`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1, and `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input that must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` should be 2.

The states of `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `start_year` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`num_tests` is at least 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the new input that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `((nums[0] + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 2**
