The code snippet provided assigns the value of `i` to the variable `pos`. This means that the value of `pos` will now be whatever the value of `i` is at the time of execution. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`) remain unchanged unless their values are directly affected by the code, which is not the case here.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `pos` is now equal to the value of `i`, while all other variables retain their initial states.
