Output State: **`N` must be greater than 3. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, `cur` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`. `nums_left` is decreased by 1. `i` is increased by 1.**

Natural language: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
