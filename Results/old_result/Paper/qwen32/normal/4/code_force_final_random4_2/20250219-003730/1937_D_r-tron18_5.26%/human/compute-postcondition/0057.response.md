Postcondition: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre` minus 1 if `el` is '>', otherwise it remains unchanged; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, with the last element removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing the previous elements plus the new element which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd` where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
