Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`; `y` is `n - 1 - i`; `i` is `i + 1`; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`; `k` is 0; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `y`, `i`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged except that the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
