The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of a list of positive integers and two integers representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove and the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1. It sorts the list and calculates the minimum possible sum of the list after Alice and Bob perform their operations. The result for each test case is printed.
