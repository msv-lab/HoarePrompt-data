The code snippet `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Given that `i` is `t + 2`, the element `arr[t + 2]` is added to the set `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is the list of integers read from the input, `s` is a set containing `arr[i]`, `arr[t + 1]`, and `arr[t + 2]`, `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2, or 1 if `n-2` is even, and 0 if `n-2` is odd, `i` is `t + 2`.**
