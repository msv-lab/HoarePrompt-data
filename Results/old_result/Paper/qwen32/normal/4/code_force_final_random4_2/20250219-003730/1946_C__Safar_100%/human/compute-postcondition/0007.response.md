Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is `{1}`, `d` is `{1: 1}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in `visited`.**

In this output state, the variable `visited` now includes the value `1`, reflecting that the node `1` has been visited. All other variables retain their initial values.
