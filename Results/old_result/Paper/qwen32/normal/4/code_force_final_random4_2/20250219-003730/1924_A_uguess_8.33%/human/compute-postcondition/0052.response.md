The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. No other variables are modified by this snippet. Therefore, the initial state of `t`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remains unchanged. The output state will reflect the new values of `n`, `k`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `m` is the third input integer, `s` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains unchanged, `cur` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `tmp` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged**.
