The given code snippet updates the value of `ans2` to be equal to `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is the first integer read from the new input, `k` is the second integer read from the new input, `x` is the third integer read from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `2x + k - 2`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[x + k - 1] + a[x + k] + ... + a[2x + k - 2])`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `_` is incremented by `x`.**
