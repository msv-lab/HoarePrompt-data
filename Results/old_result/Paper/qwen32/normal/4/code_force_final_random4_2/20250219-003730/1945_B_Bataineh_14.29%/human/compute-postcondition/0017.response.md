Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `i` is 4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input. If `m` is less than `a` or `m` is less than `b`, the condition is met, but the postcondition for the if part is the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition for the else part is also the same as the precondition. In both cases, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
