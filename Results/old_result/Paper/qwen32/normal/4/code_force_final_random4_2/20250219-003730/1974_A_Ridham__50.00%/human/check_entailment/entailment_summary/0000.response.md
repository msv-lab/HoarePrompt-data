### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the logic it uses to determine the number of screens:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is simply `x` since each 1x1 icon occupies one cell.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, since each 2x2 icon occupies four cells.

3. **Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold at most one 2x2 icon (which occupies 4 cells), the number of screens required is `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd. This is done by the expression `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + (y % 2)`.

4. **Remaining Cells**:
   - After placing all 2x2 icons, the program calculates the remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons. This is calculated as `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Handling 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), then the number of screens required is just `screen_require_for_y`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of additional screens required to place the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by calculating the extra space needed (`extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`) and then determining how many additional screens are needed to fit these icons. The number of additional screens is calculated as `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (extra_space % 15 > 0)`.

6. **Result Compilation**:
   - The program appends the calculated number of screens for each test case to the `result` list and prints the results after processing all test cases.

The logic seems correct based on the problem statement and the examples provided. The program correctly handles the placement of 2x2 icons first and then places the remaining 1x1 icons in the leftover space or on additional screens if necessary.

### Correctness: **True**
