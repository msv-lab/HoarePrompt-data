Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 2, `r` is the input string.**

In this output state, the variable `r` has been assigned the value of the input string, while all other variables (`kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `i`) retain their initial values.
