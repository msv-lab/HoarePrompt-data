Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the split input and must contain at least one element, `b` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the split input, `max_heap` is a list containing tuples `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` for each element in `a` except the one popped, `tp1` is 1, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was popped from `max_heap`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp2])`, and `diff1` is greater than `diff2`.**

In simple terms, the value of `tp1` has been incremented by 1, making `tp1` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
