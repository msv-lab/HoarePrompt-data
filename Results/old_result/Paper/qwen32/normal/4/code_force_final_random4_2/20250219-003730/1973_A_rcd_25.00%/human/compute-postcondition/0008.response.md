To determine what will be printed when the `print(p1 + p2)` statement is executed, we need to analyze the given conditions:

1. `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's part of the initial state).
2. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
3. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
4. `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`.

Given these conditions, we need to find the value of `p1 + p2`.

Since the sum \(p1 + p2 + p3\) is odd, and since `p3` is an integer, the sum of `p1` and `p2` must be even (because an even number plus an odd number is odd).

Additionally, `p3` is at least as large as `p1 + p2`. This doesn't affect the calculation of `p1 + p2` directly but ensures that the values are consistent with the given constraints.

The exact values of `p1` and `p2` are not specified, but we know their sum is even and falls within the range of possible values given the constraints on `p3`.

Thus, the output will be the sum of `p1` and `p2`, which is an even integer.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an even integer such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ 30 and p1 + p2 + p3 is odd with p3 ≥ p1 + p2)**
