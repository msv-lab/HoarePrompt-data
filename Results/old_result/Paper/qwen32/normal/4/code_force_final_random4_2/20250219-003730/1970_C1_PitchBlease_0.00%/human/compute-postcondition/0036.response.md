Output State: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[current]` is a non-empty list with at least one more unprocessed neighbor, `queue` includes the new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor` was not in `visited`, `visited` includes `unvisited_node` and `neighbor` from the previous iteration and now also includes `neighbor`, `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`. `neighbor` is the next unprocessed neighbor in `tree[current]`. The `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` as its last element.**

The `queue` has been updated to include a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, which represents the next node to be processed and its distance from the starting node. All other variables remain unchanged.
