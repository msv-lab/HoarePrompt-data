Postcondition: **`c` and `r` are integers obtained from the input, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is greater than the new value of `i`. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r` plus 1. Otherwise, `num` is adjusted based on whether `c` equals `r` and then increased by 2.**
