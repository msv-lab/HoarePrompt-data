To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the effect of each iteration on the variables `t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx`. We are given the initial state and the state after the first three iterations, which helps us understand the pattern.

### Initial State Recap
- `t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1.
- `r` is a list with an additional element appended to it. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the additional element is `0`. Otherwise, the additional element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `cx` is an empty set.
- `ax` is `1000000007`.
- `bx` is `-1`.

### Loop Logic Recap
- The loop runs `n` times.
- For each iteration, two integers `a` and `x` are read.
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
- If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
- If `a` is anything else, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

### Final Output State
After all `n` iterations, the final state will be:
- `t` will remain the initial state of the program variables minus 1.
- `r` will have `n` additional elements appended to it, each determined by the condition `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx <= ax`, or `0` if `bx > ax`. The value of `tmp` isn't mentioned in the loop logic, so it's assumed to be a constant or irrelevant for the final state calculation.
- `n` will remain as the input integer, indicating the number of iterations.
- `cx` will contain all unique `x` values that were added when `a` was not 1 or 2.
- `ax` will be the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2.
- `bx` will be the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1.

### Final Output State in Required Format
Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values added when `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2, and `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation
After the loop completes all its iterations, the state of the program will be such that `t` remains unchanged except for the initial state adjustment, `r` will have `n` new elements based on the relationship between `ax` and `bx`, `n` will still reflect the number of iterations, `cx` will have all unique values of `x` added when `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` will be the smallest `x` encountered when `a` was 2, and `bx` will be the largest `x` encountered when `a` was 1.
