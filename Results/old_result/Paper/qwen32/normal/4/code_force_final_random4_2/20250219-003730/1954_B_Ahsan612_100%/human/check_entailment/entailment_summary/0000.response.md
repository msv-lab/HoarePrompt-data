### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a "beautiful" array to make it no longer beautiful. The program does this by finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the array. If the entire array consists of the same element or there are no consecutive identical elements (which is not possible given the problem constraints), the program correctly outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of the current sequence of identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity to keep track of the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements.

2. **Iteration through the array**:
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as the previous one (`ar[i] == num`), it increments the `same` counter.
   - If the current element is different from the previous one, it updates `minn` with the smaller value between `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, but it increments `i` again after processing a different element, effectively skipping the next element in the next iteration (this is an error in the program).

3. **Final check**:
   - After the loop, the program checks if `minn` is still infinity or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array (`len(ar)`). If either condition is true, it means the array either consists of all identical elements or no sequence of identical elements was found (which is not possible given the problem constraints), so it outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`, which is the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

### Error in the Program:
The program has an error in the loop where `i` is incremented twice when a different element is encountered. This causes the program to skip elements, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
Given the error in the program, it does not always produce the correct output. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
