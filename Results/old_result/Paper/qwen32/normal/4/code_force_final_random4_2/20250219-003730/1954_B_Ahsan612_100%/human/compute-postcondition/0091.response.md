The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, and `_` is `k + 1`. The element `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, and `_` is `k + 1`.**
