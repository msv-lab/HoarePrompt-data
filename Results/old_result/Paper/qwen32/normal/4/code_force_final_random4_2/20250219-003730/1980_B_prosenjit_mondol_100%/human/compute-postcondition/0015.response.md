Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is unchanged, `f` and `k` are each decremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is `a[f]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, then `a[k]` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, `a[k]` is less than or equal to `x`, specifically `a[k]` is strictly less than `x` if it is not equal to `x`.**
