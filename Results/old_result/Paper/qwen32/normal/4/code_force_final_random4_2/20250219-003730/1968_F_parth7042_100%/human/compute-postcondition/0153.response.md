The code snippet updates the value of `q` by reading the integer value from `data[index + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing at least 2n + 5 elements; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2; `index` is 2n + 5 + 2*q; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `q` is `int(data[index + 1])`; `a` is a list of n + 1 zeros except the first n elements which are int(data[n + 5]) to int(data[2n + 4]); `pf` is a list of n + 1 zeros except the first n elements which are the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains [i] for each i from 1 to n; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries, with each result being 'YES' if it1 < len(v1), it2 >= 0, and v1[it1] < v2[it2], otherwise 'NO'.**
