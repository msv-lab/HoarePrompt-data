The value of `r` is updated to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `l` is 0; `r` is `mid`; `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`; `array[mid]` is greater than `find`.
