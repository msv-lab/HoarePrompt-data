Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an integer greater than 0; `b` is an integer greater than 0; `c` is an integer; `d` is an input string; `e` is the value of the user's input; `j` is incremented by 1; `k` is the index of `d[j]` in `e` plus 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is calculated as the position of the character `d[j]` in the string `e`, with the position being 1-based (hence adding 1 to the index). All other variables retain their initial values.
