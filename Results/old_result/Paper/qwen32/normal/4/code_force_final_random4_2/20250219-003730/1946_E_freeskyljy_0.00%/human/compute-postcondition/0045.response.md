The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of the variable `cur` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, `cur` was 1. After executing the code, `cur` becomes 2. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `M1` and `M2` are integers, `L` and `R` are lists of integers with the last element of `L` equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`. At least one of the following is true: `M1` is less than or equal to 1, `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `M2` is greater than 1. `i` is 1, and `cur` is 2. `nums_left` is `-1` if `M1` is not greater than 1, otherwise, `i` is 2, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N + 2`, and `ans` is `final_computed_ans`. The condition `i == R[cur]` is no longer necessarily true.**
