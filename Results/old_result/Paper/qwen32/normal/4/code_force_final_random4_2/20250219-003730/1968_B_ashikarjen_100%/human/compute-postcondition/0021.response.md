Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a binary string of length `n`, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is the binary string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `b[0] != a[0]`**

In this output state, the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
