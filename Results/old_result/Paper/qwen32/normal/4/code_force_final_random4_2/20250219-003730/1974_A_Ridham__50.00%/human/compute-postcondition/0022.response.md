Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing one element which is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`. If `space_x` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen` is equal to `space_x // 15`. Otherwise, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1` and `space_x` is not a multiple of 15.**

In natural language: The variable `result` now contains one element, which is the sum of `extra_screen` and `screen_require_for_y`. All other variables retain their initial values or calculated values as described.
