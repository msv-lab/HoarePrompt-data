Output State: **The program returns a list `numbers` containing all the pairs of integers (u, v) that represent the edges of the tree. Each pair (u, v) satisfies 1 <= u, v <= n, and there are exactly n-1 such pairs since the tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a list of edge pairs that describe the structure of a tree with `n` nodes, where the tree has exactly two leaves.
