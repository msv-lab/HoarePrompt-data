The `print(2)` statement in the provided code snippet will simply output the integer `2`, regardless of the values of the variables `s`, `n`, `x`, or the results of `func_1(s[0:])` and `func_1(s[x + 1:])`. The initial state describes conditions and variables, but none of these influence the value printed by the `print(2)` statement.

To break it down:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string.
- `x` is the index of the first character that differs from `s[0]` and is not equal to -1.
- `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
- `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

However, the `print(2)` statement does not depend on these variables or their values. It directly outputs the number `2`.

Output: **2**
