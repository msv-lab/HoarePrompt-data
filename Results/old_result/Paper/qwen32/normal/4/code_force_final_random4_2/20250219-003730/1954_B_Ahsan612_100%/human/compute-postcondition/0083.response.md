The code snippet `same = 1` sets the variable `same` to 1. This impacts the variable `same` directly, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last unique element encountered in the list, and `minn` is the minimum count of any sequence of identical elements encountered in the list, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `same`. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`, it retains its value; otherwise, `minn` is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`. `_` is `k + 1`.**
