Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` except the one that was popped; `item` is a tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then `ans` is increased by the maximum of the absolute differences between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, or between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, and `tp1` or `tp2` is adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `max_diff`, and either `tp1` is incremented by 1 or `tp2` is decreased by 1 depending on whether `item[2]` equals `tp1`.**
