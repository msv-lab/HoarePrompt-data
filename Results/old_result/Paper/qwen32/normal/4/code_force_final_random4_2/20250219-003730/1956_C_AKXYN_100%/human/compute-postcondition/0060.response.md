Let's break down the provided code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is assigned the value of `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Explanation:
1. **String Formatting**:
   - `'1 %d' % i` formats the string to include the value of `i` after the character '1'. Since `i` is equal to `n`, this will result in the string `'1 n'` where `n` is the actual value of the variable `n`.

2. **Range Function**:
   - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). This means the sequence will be `1, 2, 3, ..., n`.

3. **Unpacking with `*` Operator**:
   - The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the sequence generated by the `range` function, so each number in the sequence is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.

### Combining the Results:
- The `print` function will first output the formatted string `'1 n'`.
- Then, it will output each number in the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` separated by spaces.

### Example:
If `n` is 5, then:
- `i` is also 5.
- `'1 %d' % i` becomes `'1 5'`.
- `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

Thus, the output will be:
```
1 5 1 2 3 4 5
```

### General Output:
Given the initial state where `n` is any integer greater than 0, the output will be:
- The string `'1 n'` where `n` is the value of the variable `n`.
- Followed by the sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

### Final Output:
Output: **1 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**
