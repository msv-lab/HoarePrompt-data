The value of `counter` is incremented by 1. The values of `a` and `j` remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` is a non-empty string and `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(a) - 1` still holds true.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is incremented by 1.**
