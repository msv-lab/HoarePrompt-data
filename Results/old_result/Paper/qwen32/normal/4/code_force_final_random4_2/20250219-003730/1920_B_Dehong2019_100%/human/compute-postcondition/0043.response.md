The code snippet provided assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Therefore, `ans2` will now hold the value of `ans1`, which is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input and greater than 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `x` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + k - 1`, `ans2` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `ans1` is `sum(a) - 2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.**
