Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

### Problem Recap
We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\). The program should output -1 if it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `ar`.

2. **Identifying Segments:**
   - The program initializes `same` to 1, indicating the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - It also initializes `num` to the first element of the array and `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum size of any segment of identical elements.
   - The program then iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element is different, it updates `minn` to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to update `minn` with the last segment length.

3. **Decision Making:**
   - If `minn` remains infinity (which should not happen as it's initialized to the first segment length) or if `minn` equals the length of the array (meaning all elements are the same), the program outputs -1.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

### Reasoning

- **Correctness of Identifying Segments:**
  - The program correctly identifies segments of identical elements and tracks the minimum segment length.

- **Correctness of Decision Making:**
  - If all elements are the same (`minn == len(ar)`), the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so outputting -1 is correct.
  - However, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. Removing the entire segment of minimum length does not necessarily make the array non-beautiful. The correct approach should consider the structure of the array and the segments more carefully.

### Counterexample

Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]`:
- Segments of identical elements: `[1], [2], [1], [3], [1], [2], [1]`
- Minimum segment length: `1`
- Removing one element from any segment of length `1` does not make the array non-beautiful because the array remains beautiful after any such removal.

The correct minimum number of elements to remove in this case is `3` (removing all `1`s or all `2`s).

### Conclusion

The program's logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. It does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
