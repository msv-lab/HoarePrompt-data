### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Calculate the number of final configurations of a chessboard after `k` moves, where the player and the computer place rooks in alternating turns with specific rules.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The board is `n x n`.
   - The player and the computer have made `k` moves each, except when a move is skipped due to `r = c`.
   - A valid move places a rook in a position not attacked by any other rook.
   - The player places white rooks, and the computer places black rooks.
   - The computer mirrors the player's move unless `r = c`.
3. **Output**: The number of different possible final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves.

2. **Counting Moves**:
   - The program iterates through the `k` moves.
   - It increments `num` by `1` if `r_i == c_i` (move skipped by the computer).
   - It increments `num` by `2` if `r_i != c_i` (both player and computer make moves).

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells**:
   - The program calculates `m = n - num`, which represents the number of cells that can still be used for placing rooks.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - If `m == 0` or `m == 1`, the program prints `1` because there are no or one possible configuration.
   - For `m > 1`, the program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations:
     - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` remaining cells.
     - The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
     - The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the base cases (`m = 0` and `m = 1`).
- The dynamic programming approach seems correct for calculating the number of configurations for `m > 1`.
- The recurrence relation considers all possible ways to place rooks in the remaining cells, taking into account the mirroring rule.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

**Correctness: True**
