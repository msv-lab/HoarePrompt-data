To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the behavior of the loop over its iterations:

1. The loop runs `t` times.
2. For each iteration:
   - It reads `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`.
   - It processes the string `s` to count how many times a sequence of `k` distinct characters appears (`cnt`).
   - If `cnt` is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` based on the current state of `cnt` and `cur`.

### Output State after All Iterations

The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are re-read for each iteration of the loop and do not retain their values between iterations. The variables `cnt`, `cur`, `cur_ss`, `tmp`, and `ans` are local to each iteration and are re-initialized at the start of each iteration.

The only variables that might retain information across iterations are those that are printed or outputted. Since `t` specifies the number of iterations and each iteration is independent, the final output state is determined by the outputs for each of the `t` iterations.

### Formulating the Final Output State

The final output state includes:

- The results ("YES" or "NO") for each of the `t` iterations.
- The constructed string `ans` for each iteration where `cnt` is less than `n`.

### Natural Language Description

After all iterations, the final output state consists of:
- `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of one iteration.
- Each line is either "YES" if the number of sequences of `k` distinct characters in `s` is at least `n`, or "NO" followed by a constructed string `ans` if it is not.

### Final Output State Format

Based on the above analysis, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **The output consists of `t` lines. Each line is either "YES" if the number of sequences of `k` distinct characters in `s` is at least `n`, or "NO" followed by a constructed string `ans` if it is not.**

This format ensures that the output reflects the results of all `t` iterations of the loop.
