The code converts the set `s` into a list. The set `s` contains all unique elements from the list `arr`. After the conversion, `s` is no longer a set but a list containing the same unique elements.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `s` is a list containing all unique elements from `arr`.**
