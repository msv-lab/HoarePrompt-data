The code snippet `p = l[i]` assigns the value of `l[i]` to `p`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `p` will now hold the value of `l[2]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `q`) remain unchanged by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `n` must be at least 3; `l` is a new list of integers derived from the input; `i` is 2; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[p - 1]`.**
