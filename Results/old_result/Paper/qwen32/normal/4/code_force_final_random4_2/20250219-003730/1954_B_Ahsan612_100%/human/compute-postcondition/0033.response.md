To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop variables evolve based on the given conditions.

### Key Variables and Their Initial State:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged throughout the loop).
- `n`: An input integer (unchanged throughout the loop).
- `ar`: A list of integers.
- `same`: Initialized to 1.
- `num`: Initialized to `ar[0]`.
- `minn`: Initialized to `inf`.
- `i`: Initialized to 1.

### Loop Logic:
1. The loop runs while `i < len(ar)`.
2. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, `same` is incremented.
3. If `ar[i]` does not equal `num`, `i` is incremented, `num` is updated to `ar[i]`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.
4. Regardless of the above conditions, `i` is incremented at the end of each loop iteration.

### Output States After Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration**:
  - `i` becomes 2 if `ar[1] == num` or 3 if `ar[1] != num`.
  - `same` becomes 2 if `ar[1] == num` or 1 if `ar[1] != num`.
  - `num` becomes `ar[2]` if `ar[1] != num`.
  - `minn` becomes 1 if `ar[1] != num`.

- **After 2 iterations**:
  - `i` becomes 3 if `ar[2] == num` or 4 if `ar[2] != num`.
  - `same` becomes 3 if `ar[2] == num` or 2 if `ar[2] != num`.
  - `num` becomes `ar[3]` if `ar[2] != num`.
  - `minn` remains 1 as long as `same` was not less than 1.

- **After 3 iterations**:
  - `i` becomes 4 if `ar[3] == num` or 5 if `ar[3] != num`.
  - `same` becomes 4 if `ar[3] == num` or 3 if `ar[3] != num`.
  - `num` becomes `ar[4]` if `ar[3] != num`.
  - `minn` remains 1 as long as `same` was not less than 1.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue until `i` is no longer less than `len(ar)`. This means `i` will eventually reach `len(ar)`. At the end of the loop:
- `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`.
- `same` will be the count of consecutive elements that were equal to the last `num` before the loop terminated.
- `minn` will be the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop.
- `num` will be the last unique element encountered in the array.

### Conclusion:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last consecutive elements in `ar` that were equal, `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive equal elements found in `ar`, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will finish when all elements of the array have been processed. The final state will reflect the length of the array, the count of the last sequence of equal elements, the smallest sequence of equal elements found, and the last unique element in the array.
