The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, sorts these integers, converts them back to strings, and then maps them into an iterable (ar). The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet, but `n` is used to determine how many integers the input will contain.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input.**

Natural language explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `ar` now holds a map object that contains string representations of integers, which were sorted in ascending order from the input.
