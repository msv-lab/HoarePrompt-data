You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n - 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it's correct.

### Problem Analysis:
- We start with `n` islands, all interconnected by bridges.
- Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges.
- We need to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, starting from island 1, after Dominater optimally destroys the bridges.

### Key Observations:
1. **No Bridges Destroyed (`k = 0`)**: Everule can visit all `n` islands.
2. **Maximum Bridges Destroyed (`k = n*(n-1)/2`)**: All bridges are destroyed, and Everule can only visit island 1.
3. **Intermediate Cases (`0 < k < n*(n-1)/2`)**: Dominater should aim to disconnect as many islands from island 1 as possible. The optimal strategy is to cut off one island at a time by destroying bridges that connect it to the rest of the network.

### Strategy:
- To disconnect an island from the network, Dominater needs to destroy the bridge connecting it to island 1 (or any other island that is still connected to island 1). 
- Dominater can disconnect up to `k` islands if `k >= n-1`. If `k < n-1`, not all islands can be disconnected from island 1.

### Specific Cases:
- If `k >= n-1`, Everule can only visit island 1 because Dominater can disconnect all other islands.
- If `k < n-1`, Everule can still visit `n-k` islands (including island 1) because Dominater can only disconnect `k` islands.

### Program Analysis:
Let's analyze the given program to see if it aligns with the above strategy:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
```

- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
- If `k >= n-1`, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).
- If `k < n-1`, it prints `n-1` (Everule can visit `n-k` islands, but the program incorrectly prints `n-1`).

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the case where `k >= n-1` by printing `1`. However, it incorrectly handles the case where `k < n-1`. The program should print `n - k` instead of `n - 1` when `k < n-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum number of islands Everule can visit when `k < n-1`.

Correctness: **False**
