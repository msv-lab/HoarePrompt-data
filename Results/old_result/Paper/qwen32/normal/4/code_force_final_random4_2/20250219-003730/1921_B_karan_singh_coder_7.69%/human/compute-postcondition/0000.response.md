To determine the necessary adjustments for the given loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop header and the variables involved. The loop in question is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates based on the value obtained from `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must be a positive integer. 

Let's break down the state before the loop starts:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `s` and `f` are strings of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

However, the loop header only depends on the value provided by `input()`. Therefore, the state of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `f` do not affect whether the loop executes. The only thing that matters is the value obtained from `input()`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, the value obtained from `input()` must be at least 1. Since `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we can assume that the input will be a valid integer within this range.

Thus, no adjustments are needed for `t`, `n`, `s`, or `f` to ensure the loop executes. The only requirement is that the input value should be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s` and `f` are strings of length n, where each character is either '0' or '1', and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The input value for the loop must be at least 1**.
