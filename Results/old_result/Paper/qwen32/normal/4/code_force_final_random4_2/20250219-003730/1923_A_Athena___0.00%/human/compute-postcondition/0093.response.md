To determine the output of the `print(res)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the variables involved.

Initial State:
- `a` is a list with all trailing zeros removed.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged (though they are not used in the provided print statement, they may be relevant in other parts of the code).
- `res` is the count of zeros in the list `a`.

Since `a` has all trailing zeros removed, it means that `a` does not contain any zeros at the end. However, `a` might still contain zeros elsewhere in the list.

The variable `res` is defined as the count of zeros in the list `a`. Since `a` has had all trailing zeros removed, `res` will be the count of any zeros that are not trailing.

Given that the problem specifies `res` is the count of zeros in the list `a` and since `a` has no trailing zeros, `res` will be the count of all zeros present in `a` before the trailing zeros were removed.

However, the exact number of zeros in `a` before trailing zeros were removed is not provided, so we can only describe `res` in terms of the zeros present in the modified list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of zeros in the list `a` after all trailing zeros have been removed)**
