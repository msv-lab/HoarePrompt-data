The code snippet simply initializes `kq2` as an empty string. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `kq1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `a` is an input string; `b` is an input string; `kq1` is an empty string; `kq2` is an empty string.**
