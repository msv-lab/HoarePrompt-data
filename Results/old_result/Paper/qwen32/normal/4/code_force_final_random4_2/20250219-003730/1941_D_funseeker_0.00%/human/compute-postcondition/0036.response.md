The only variable in the loop head is `q`, which is the variable being iterated over from the set `ans`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `q` and how it changes in the loop.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `m` is still greater than 0.
- `x` and `ans` are sets containing at least one value.
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

Since `q` is the variable being iterated over, at the start of the next iteration, `q` will be the next element in the set `ans`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, and `temp` remain unchanged in the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is still greater than 0, `x` and `ans` are sets containing at least one value, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`**.
