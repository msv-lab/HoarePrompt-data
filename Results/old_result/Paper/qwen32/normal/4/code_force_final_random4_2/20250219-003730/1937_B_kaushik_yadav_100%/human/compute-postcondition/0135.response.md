Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is incremented by 1, `j` must be less than `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `counter` is increased by 1. The values of `a` and `j` remain as per the initial state, with `j` still being incremented by 1 and maintaining the condition that `j` must be less than `len(a) - 1`.
