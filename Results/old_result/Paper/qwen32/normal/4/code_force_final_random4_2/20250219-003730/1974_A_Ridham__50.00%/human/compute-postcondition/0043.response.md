The code snippet `space_y = y * 4` updates the value of `space_y`. Since the initial state specifies that `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, executing this line does not change its value. Therefore, the state of `space_y` remains the same as it was initially defined.

No other variables are affected by this line of code. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `total_space`, `remaining_cells`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, `n` is decremented by 1, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`. `result` is a list containing two elements, the second element being `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` based on the conditions.**
