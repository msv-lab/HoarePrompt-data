Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 4 elements, `_` is `k + 1`. If `ar[i] == num`, then `i` is 3, `same` is 4, `minn` is `inf`, and `num` is `ar[3]`. Otherwise, `i` is 4, `same` is 1, `minn` is 3, and `num` is `ar[4]`.**
