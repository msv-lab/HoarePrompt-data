The code snippet simply sets the variable `work` to `True`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the newly stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations.**
