The code snippet `ind.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `ind`. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`, and this condition still holds after the operation. The list `ind` now contains the index `i` as its new last element.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first element is `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with all `a_i`'s being distinct. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `x` is the value of the `k`-th element in the current test case list within `a`. `ind` is a list containing the index `i`. `c` is 0. `n` is at least 2. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than `x`.**
