Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer and `a` is not equal to 1, `x` is an input integer. If `a` is equal to 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `1000000007`. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing `x`.**
