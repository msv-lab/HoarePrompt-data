Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and must have at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`; `ans` is 0; `i` is the next element in the list `a` after `i_next`; `diff1` is `abs(i - b[0])`; `diff2` is `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `max_heap` includes the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. Otherwise, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`.**
