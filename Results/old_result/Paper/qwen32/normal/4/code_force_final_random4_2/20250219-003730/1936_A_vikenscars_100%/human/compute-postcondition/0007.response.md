To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given line of code on the variables. The line of code is:

```python
ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
```

This line assigns the result of the function call `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` to the variable `ans`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` without more information about `func_1`. However, we can still describe the state based on the information provided.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.
- `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration.

After the execution of the given line of code, the value of `ans` will be whatever `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged unless `func_1` has side effects that modify them, which is not indicated in the problem statement.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, `ans` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)`**.
