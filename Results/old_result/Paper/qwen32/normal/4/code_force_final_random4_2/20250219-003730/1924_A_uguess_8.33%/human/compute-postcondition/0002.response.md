The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial state only mentions that `t` is an integer within a specific range, which is not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the output state will include the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` as integers derived from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input.**
