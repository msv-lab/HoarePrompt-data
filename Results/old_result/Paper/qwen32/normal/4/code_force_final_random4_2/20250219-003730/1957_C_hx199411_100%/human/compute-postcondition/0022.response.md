To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the variables involved.

The loop runs `k` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `c` and `r` from the input. If `c` equals `r`, it increments `num` by 1. Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2.

Let's summarize the steps and the state at the end of all iterations:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1.
   - `n` and `k` are integers provided as input.
   - `num` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `k` iterations.
   - For each iteration, the values of `c` and `r` are read from the input.
   - If `c == r`, `num` is incremented by 1.
   - If `c != r`, `num` is incremented by 2.

3. **Output State after all iterations:**
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `num` is the accumulated sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over the `k` iterations.

The final output state is entirely dependent on the values of `c` and `r` provided in the `k` iterations. However, we can describe the state in terms of the variables:

- `t`: Remains the same as the initial value.
- `n`: Remains the same as the initial value.
- `k`: Remains the same as the initial value.
- `num`: The final value of `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over the `k` iterations.

Thus, the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over the `k` iterations.**

In simpler terms, `t`, `n`, and `k` do not change, and `num` is the total count of increments based on the input pairs `c` and `r`.
