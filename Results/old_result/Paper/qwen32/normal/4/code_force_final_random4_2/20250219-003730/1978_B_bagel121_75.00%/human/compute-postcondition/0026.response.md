Postcondition: **`t` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`, and `p2` is `(n - k) * a`.**
