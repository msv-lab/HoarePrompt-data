The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `not_mid`. If `i` is less than `not_mid`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has taken a value such that the loop is about to terminate. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, provided it is still less than `not_mid`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` has just completed an iteration, so it must have been `not_mid - 1` (the last value it could take before the loop terminates). To make the loop execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to `not_mid - 1 + 1 = not_mid`, but since the loop will terminate when `i` reaches `not_mid`, we need to set `i` to the next valid value it would have taken before the loop terminated, which is `not_mid - 1` incremented by 1, but since we want the state just before the loop terminates, we set `i` to `not_mid - 1` again and understand that the next iteration would be the last.

However, to correctly reflect the state just before the next iteration starts, we should set `i` to the value it would take at the start of that iteration, which is `not_mid - 1 + 1 = not_mid`, but since we need the state just before the loop terminates, we set `i` to `not_mid - 1` and understand the next increment will terminate the loop.

State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid - 1\), `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique` for \(i = 0\) to \(mid + not_mid - 1\), `arr[left + mid + i]` is `big_element - i` for \(i = 0\) to `not_mid - 1`, `i` is `not_mid - 1`**
