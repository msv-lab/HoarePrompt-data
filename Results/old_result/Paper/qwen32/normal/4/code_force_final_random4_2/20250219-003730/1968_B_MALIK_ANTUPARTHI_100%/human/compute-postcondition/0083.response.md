Output State: **`k` is `j`, `i` is 3, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is the second integer from the input, `d` is the input string, `e` is the next input from the user, and the character `d[j]` is not present in the substring `e[k:]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
