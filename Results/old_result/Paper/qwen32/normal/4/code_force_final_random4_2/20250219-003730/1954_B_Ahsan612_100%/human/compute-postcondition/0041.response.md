`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `ar`, `i`, `same`, `num`, `minn`) are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(ar)`, `same` is the count of the last consecutive elements in `ar` that were equal, `num` is the last unique element in `ar`. If `minn` is either infinity or equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` retains its value. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum of its previous value and `same`. The loop is about to start its next iteration, which means `int(input())` has not yet decremented the iteration count.**
