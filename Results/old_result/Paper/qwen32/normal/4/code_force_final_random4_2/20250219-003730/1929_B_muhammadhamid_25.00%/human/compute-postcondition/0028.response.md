Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` (the size of the square grid) and `k` (the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell). The function returns a result indicating whether it is possible to color at least one cell in each of the `k` diagonals of the `n x n` grid.**
