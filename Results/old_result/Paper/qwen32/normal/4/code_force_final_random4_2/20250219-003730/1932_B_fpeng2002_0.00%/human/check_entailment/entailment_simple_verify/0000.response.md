### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of each sign.
- The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the i-th sign must occur after the (i-1)-th sign.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, but they do not explicitly validate the logic of the formula used within the loop.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program is incorrect due to the formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- The assessment suggests that the correct formula should be `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

#### Analysis:

Let's analyze the logic of the formula:
- The goal is to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.
- The correct formula to achieve this is indeed `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- The original formula `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` adds an extra `+1` inside the division, which shifts the calculation incorrectly.

To illustrate this, let's consider a test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  3 2
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  4
  ```
- Explanation:
  - The first sign occurs in year 3.
  - The tribe waits for the second sign starting from year 4.
  - The second sign occurs in year 4 (since 4 is a multiple of 2 and is the smallest multiple of 2 greater than 3).

Let's verify the behavior of the original program with this test case:
- `start_year = 0`
- For the first sign (`nums[0] = 3`):
  - `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = (1 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3`
- For the second sign (`nums[1] = 2`):
  - `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = (4 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (2 + 1) * 2 = 6`

As seen, the original program incorrectly outputs `6` instead of `4`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The formula used in the provided program is incorrect, and the suggested correction is valid.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
