The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is between 1 and 2n inclusive. It generates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, of length `n`. The list `arr` is filled with segments of length `k` (or less for the last segment) with values from 1 to the number of cliques, where the number of cliques is the ceiling of `n / k`. The list `cliquess` is similar to `arr`, but the first segment is filled with 0s. The function prints the list `arr`, the number of cliques, and the list `cliquess`.
