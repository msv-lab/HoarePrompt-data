The code snippet provided takes an input string of integers, converts them to a list of integers, sorts the list, and then maps each integer back to a string. The variable `ar` is updated to hold this map object.

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499, `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input, `n` is assigned the value of the integer input.

The code:
```
ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
```

Impact: 
- The `input().split()` part reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings.
- `map(int, ...)` converts each string in the list to an integer.
- `sorted(...)` sorts the list of integers.
- `map(str, ...)` converts each integer back to a string.
- `ar` is updated to hold this new map object of sorted strings.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499, `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input, `n` is assigned the value of the integer input.**

Explanation:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `ar` is now a map object containing strings that represent the integers from the input, sorted in ascending order.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet.

However, since `ar` is described to be a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the input, and the code modifies `ar`, the correct output state should reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 499, `ar` is a map object containing strings of sorted integers from the updated input, `n` is assigned the value of the integer input.**
