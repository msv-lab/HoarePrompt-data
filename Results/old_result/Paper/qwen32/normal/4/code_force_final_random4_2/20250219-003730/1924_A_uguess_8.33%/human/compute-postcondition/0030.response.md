Postcondition: **`t` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop. `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop. `s` remains unchanged as it is only read, not modified. `cnt` is incremented each time a subset of `k` distinct characters is found in sequence, and `cnt` is now greater than or equal to `n`. `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence.`**
