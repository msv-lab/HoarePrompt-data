Reasoning:

To determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color, we need to analyze the problem based on the given constraints.

1. **Single Part (n = 1):**
   - If the ribbon has only one part (n = 1), Alice's painting doesn't matter because Bob can always repaint this single part to any color he wants. Therefore, the answer is always "NO".

2. **Single Color (m = 1):**
   - If there is only one color available (m = 1), Alice has no choice but to paint all parts the same color. Bob can then repaint at most k parts (which is at least one part since k >= 1) to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is always "NO".

3. **General Case:**
   - If there are multiple parts and multiple colors, Alice can distribute the colors in such a way that no single color can be used to repaint all parts within the limit of k repainting actions by Bob.
   - The key idea is to see if it's possible for Bob to repaint k parts to match the majority color. If the majority color (after Alice paints) has a count of parts greater than n - k, Bob can repaint the other parts to match this majority color. Hence, Alice should avoid such a scenario.
   - To prevent Bob from making all parts the same color, Alice can try to distribute the colors as evenly as possible. The maximum number of parts that can have the same color, if distributed evenly, is `math.ceil(n / m)`.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it means Bob can repaint the remaining parts to match the majority color, making it possible for him to make all parts the same color. Therefore, the answer is "NO".
   - Otherwise, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no color appears more than `math.ceil(n / m)` times, making it impossible for Bob to repaint all parts to the same color with k repainting actions. Therefore, the answer is "YES".

The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It checks if `n <= k` (which covers the case where Bob can repaint all parts) or if `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` (which covers the case where Bob can repaint enough parts to match the majority color).
- If either condition is true, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
