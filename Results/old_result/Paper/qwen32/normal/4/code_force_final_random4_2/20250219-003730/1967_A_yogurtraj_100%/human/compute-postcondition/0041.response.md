Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` is an integer that is provided by the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
- `r` is the last element of the list `a`.
- `rem` is initialized to 0.
- `y` is initialized to 0.
- `k` is initialized to 0 (Note: This `k` is redundant because it is reassigned to 0 immediately and not used in the print statement).

### Print Statement:
```
print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
```

### Analysis:
- `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`. Since `a` is sorted, `r` is the largest element in `a`.
- `rem` is 0.
- `y` is 0.
- The expression `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y` simplifies to `(r - 1) * n + 1` because `rem` and `y` are both 0.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `r`**: `r` is the last element of the sorted list `a`.
2. **Calculate `(r - 1) * n + 1`**:
   - Subtract 1 from `r`.
   - Multiply the result by `n`.
   - Add 1 to the product.

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `(r - 1) * n + 1`.

Since the exact values of `r` and `n` are not provided, we describe the output based on the given variables.

Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last element of the sorted list `a` and n is the provided integer)**
