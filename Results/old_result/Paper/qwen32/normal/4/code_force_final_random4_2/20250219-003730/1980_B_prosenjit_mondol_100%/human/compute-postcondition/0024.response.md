The `print('YES')` statement will output the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `x` as they are not used in the print statement.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. The variable `n` is the first input integer.
3. The variable `f` is the second input integer decremented by 1.
4. The variable `k` is the third input integer decremented by 1.
5. The variable `a` is a list of integers from the input sorted in descending order.
6. The variable `x` is the element at index `f` in the list `a`.

None of these variables are used in the `print('YES')` statement. The statement directly prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
