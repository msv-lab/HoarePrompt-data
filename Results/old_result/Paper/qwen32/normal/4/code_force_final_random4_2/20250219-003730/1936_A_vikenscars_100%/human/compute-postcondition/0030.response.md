The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `pair_idx`. The values of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_item_idx` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` and `pair_idx` is now equal to `i`.

Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `pair_idx` is equal to `i`**.
