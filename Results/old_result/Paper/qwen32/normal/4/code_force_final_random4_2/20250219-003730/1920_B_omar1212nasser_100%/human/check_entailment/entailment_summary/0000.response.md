### Reasoning:

The provided Python program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which work together to solve the problem described. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and whether it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input and Sorting**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It sorts the list `a`. Sorting is crucial because it allows us to easily identify the smallest and largest elements, which are relevant for Alice's removals and Bob's negations.

2. **Calculating the Optimal Sum**:
   - After sorting, the program calls `func_2` with the arguments `k` (removals), `x` (negatives), and the sorted list `a`.
   - `func_2` calculates the maximum possible sum after Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob negates up to `x` elements. Here’s how it does it:
     - It starts by calculating the sum of all elements `s`.
     - It then calculates the sum of the last `x` elements `s2` (the largest `x` elements since the list is sorted).
     - It computes the initial potential sum after Bob negates these `x` elements: `s - 2 * s2`.
     - It iteratively considers removing the `i-th` largest element (from the end of the sorted list) and adjusts `s` and `s2` accordingly.
     - For each removal, it checks if Bob can negate an additional element by increasing `negatives + i` and adjusts `s2` to include this new element.
     - It keeps track of all these potential sums and returns the maximum one.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - Sorting the list allows us to efficiently determine the smallest and largest elements.
   - By considering all possible numbers of removals (from 0 to `k`), and adjusting the calculations for Bob's negations, the program ensures that it evaluates all possible optimal strategies for both players.
   - The use of `s - 2 * s2` correctly accounts for the effect of negating `x` elements, as negating an element effectively subtracts twice its value from the sum (once for its original value and once for the negated value).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum possible sum of the array after both players have made their optimal moves. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to handle the input, sort the array, and compute the optimal sum as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
