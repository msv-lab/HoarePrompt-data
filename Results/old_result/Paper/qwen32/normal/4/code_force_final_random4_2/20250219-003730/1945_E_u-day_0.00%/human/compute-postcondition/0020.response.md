The code snippet `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to the current value of `mid`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(n - 1) // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, the value of `high` is now set to this `mid` value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`.**
