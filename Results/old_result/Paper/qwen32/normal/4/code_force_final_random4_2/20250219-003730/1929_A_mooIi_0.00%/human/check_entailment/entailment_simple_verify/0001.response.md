### Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead of calculating the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, the program simply sorts the array and prints the sorted elements as a space-separated string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program correctly sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Calculating Beauty**: The program does not calculate the beauty. It should iterate through the sorted array and sum the differences between consecutive elements.
3. **Output**: The program prints the sorted array as a string, which is not the expected output. The expected output is the maximum beauty of the array.

### Correct Approach:
To compute the maximum beauty:
1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Initialize a variable to store the beauty sum.
3. Iterate through the sorted array and for each element (except the first), add the difference between the current element and the previous element to the beauty sum.
4. Print the beauty sum for each test case.

### Example of Correct Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
