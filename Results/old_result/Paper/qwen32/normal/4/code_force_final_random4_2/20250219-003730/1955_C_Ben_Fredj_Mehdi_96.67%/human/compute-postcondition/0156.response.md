Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input with the first element and the last element each decreased by 1, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` from the start up to the first space character, `k` is an integer value of at least 2, `d` is the length of `a` minus 2, and `a[d]` is not 0. If `a[g]` is 0, then `g` is 1; otherwise, `g` remains 0. The current value of `a[d]` is not 0.**

In simpler terms: The value of `d` has been decremented by 1, so it now represents the second-to-last index of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
