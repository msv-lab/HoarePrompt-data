To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change based on the conditions provided.

The loop iterates over the indices of the list `s` starting from 1 up to `n-2` (since the range is `range(1, n-1)`). The loop checks if the difference between consecutive elements in `s` is greater than 1. If it is, the loop breaks. Otherwise, it toggles the value of `ans` using the XOR operation (`ans ^= 1`).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` where `n` is not equal to 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `s` is a sorted list with `0` as the first element, followed by all unique elements from `arr`.
- `ans` is 1.

The loop will execute for `n-2` iterations if `s[i] - s[i - 1] <= 1` for all `i` in the range `1` to `n-2`. If at any point `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the loop will break early.

Let's analyze the given output states for the first 3 iterations:
1. After the first iteration, `ans` is set to 0 if `s[1] - s[0] <= 1`.
2. After the second iteration, `ans` is set to 1 if `s[2] - s[1] <= 1` and `ans` was 0 before.
3. After the third iteration, `ans` is set to 0 if `s[3] - s[2] <= 1` and `ans` was 1 before.

From this pattern, we can see that `ans` will toggle between 0 and 1 based on the differences between consecutive elements in `s`. If the loop completes all `n-2` iterations, `ans` will be 0 if `n-2` is odd and 1 if `n-2` is even.

### Final Output State:
- If `n-2` is odd, `ans` will be 0.
- If `n-2` is even, `ans` will be 1.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **ans is 0 if n-2 is odd, ans is 1 if n-2 is even.**

In natural language, the final value of `ans` depends on whether the number of iterations (`n-2`) is odd or even. If the number of iterations is odd, `ans` will be 0, and if it is even, `ans` will be 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`) remain unchanged.
