Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); if `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, then `l` is updated to `mid` and `r` remains `n`; otherwise, `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to `mid`. `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`.**
