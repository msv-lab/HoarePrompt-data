The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the value of `n`. According to the initial state, `n` is described as the first input integer. Since no specific value for `n` is provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` is defined as the first input integer.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the value of `n`.

Given that we do not have a specific value for `n`, the output will be the value of `n` as provided by the input.

Output: **n (where n is the first input integer)**
