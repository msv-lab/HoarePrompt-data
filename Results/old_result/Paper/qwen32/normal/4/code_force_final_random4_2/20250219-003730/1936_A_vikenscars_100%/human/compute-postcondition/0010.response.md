The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4.

To execute the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (`x + 1`), making it `x + 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

The state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is `x + 2`**.

Note that `ans` and `max_item_idx` are not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted based on the loop head alone.
