Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we can analyze the situation step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `z` is initialized to 0.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` up to the first space.
- `k` is the integer value of the substring of the original `a` starting right after the first space.
- `k` is not equal to 9999999999, 1999999998, 1999999999, and it is not the case that (n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1).
- The current value of `n` is 101.
- The current value of `k` is 100000000000.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('1')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('1')
```

This statement explicitly prints the string `'1'`. The values of the variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

### Output:
Output: **1**
