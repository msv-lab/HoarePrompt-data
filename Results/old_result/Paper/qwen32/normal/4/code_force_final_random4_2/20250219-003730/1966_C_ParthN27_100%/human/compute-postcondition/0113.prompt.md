Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s`, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 1, the number of iterations left is `t-1`, and `n` is not equal to 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans ^= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the number of iterations left is `t-1`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0 and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is 1 or less.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the number of iterations left is `t-1`, `i` is `i_end + 1` where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, and `i_end + 1` must be less than `n-1`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is toggled by XOR with 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the number of iterations left is `t-1`, `i` is `i_end + 2` where `i_end + 2` must be less than `n-1`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` is toggled to `1 - ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
