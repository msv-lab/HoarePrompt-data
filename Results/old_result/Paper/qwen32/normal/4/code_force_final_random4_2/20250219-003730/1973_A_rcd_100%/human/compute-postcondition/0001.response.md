The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` represent the scores of the three players and are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order**
