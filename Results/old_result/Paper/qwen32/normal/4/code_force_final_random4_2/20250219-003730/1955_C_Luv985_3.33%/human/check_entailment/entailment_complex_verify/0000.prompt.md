You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
Let's carefully analyze the given code and the problem description to identify potential issues.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have `n` ships with given durability.
- The Kraken attacks the ships in an alternating pattern: first the first ship, then the last ship, then the first again, and so on.
- Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
- A ship sinks when its durability drops to 0 and is no longer subjected to attacks.
- We need to determine how many ships have sunk after `k` attacks.

#### Code Analysis:
The code provided aims to simulate the Kraken's attacks and count the number of ships that have sunk. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Read the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (number of ships) and `k` (number of attacks).
   - Read the durability of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Simulation of Attacks**:
   - Initialize two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the first and last ship, respectively.
   - Initialize `ans` to count the number of sunk ships.
   - While there are ships remaining to attack (`l < r`) and attacks left (`k > 0`):
     - Determine the minimum durability between the first and last ship (`mi`).
     - If `mi * 2 <= k`:
       - Reduce the durability of both the first and last ship by `mi`.
       - Decrease the number of attacks by `mi * 2`.
       - If the durability of the first ship becomes 0, increment the sunk ship count and move the `l` pointer to the next ship.
       - If the durability of the last ship becomes 0, increment the sunk ship count and move the `r` pointer to the previous ship.
     - If `mi * 2 > k`:
       - Determine if the remaining attacks can sink either the first or last ship.
       - If the remaining attacks can sink the first ship, increment the sunk ship count.
       - Break out of the loop as there are no more attacks left.

3. **Handling Single Ship Case**:
   - If `l == r`, check if the remaining attacks can sink the last remaining ship.

#### Issues in the Code:
- **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Attacks**:
  - When `mi * 2 > k`, the code incorrectly breaks out of the loop after checking if the remaining attacks can sink the first ship. It should also check if the remaining attacks can sink the last ship.
  - The logic for handling the remaining attacks is flawed. It should consider both the first and last ship's durability and the remaining attacks more carefully.

- **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
  - The code does not correctly handle cases where the number of attacks `k` is very large compared to the total durability of the ships.
  - There might be cases where the Kraken can sink more ships than the code currently accounts for.

#### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 20
2 7 1 8 2
```
- The Kraken can sink all 5 ships in 18 attacks (2+8+2+7+1), but the code might incorrectly break out of the loop before sinking all ships.

#### Corrected Logic:
- The code should continue to attack the ships until either there are no ships left to attack or no attacks left.
- It should correctly handle the scenario where the remaining attacks can sink either the first or last ship.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when the number of attacks is large and the remaining attacks can sink either the first or last ship. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
