Let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` and `k` are integers that will be read as input for each test case.
- There is a condition that checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If true, `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`; otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `k`.
- Regardless of the values of these variables, the code will always print the integer `1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
