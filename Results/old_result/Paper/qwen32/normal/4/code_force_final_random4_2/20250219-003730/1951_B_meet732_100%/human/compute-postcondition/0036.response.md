Postcondition: **`a` remains unchanged, `x` remains the k-th element, `ind` contains indices of up to the first two elements greater than `x`, and `c` is the count of these elements (0, 1, or 2). Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list and the length of `ind` is 2. The current value of `ind[0]` is 0.**
