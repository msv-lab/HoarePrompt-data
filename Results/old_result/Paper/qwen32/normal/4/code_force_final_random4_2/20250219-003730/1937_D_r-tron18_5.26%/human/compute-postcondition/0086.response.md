Functionality: **The function `func_2` processes a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element is computed based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The specific computation involves cumulative sums and conditions based on the counts of '<' and '>' characters encountered. The string `s1` remains unchanged after the function execution.**
