Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `temp` is -1, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is the list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is the list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at the position `n - i` from the end of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the element at position `i` in `b`.**
