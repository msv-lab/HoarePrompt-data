The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It has no impact on the values of the variables unless it is within a loop structure and affects the loop's flow. Since the provided code snippet only contains a `continue` statement without any loop, it does not alter the values of the variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
