Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `high` is `n - 1`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language: The value of `low` is now set to `(n - 1) // 2`, which is the same as `mid`. All other variables retain their initial values.
