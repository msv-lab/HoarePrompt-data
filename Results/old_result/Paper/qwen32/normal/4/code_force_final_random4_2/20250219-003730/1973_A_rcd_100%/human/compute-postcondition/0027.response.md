Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t > 0`: This is a precondition but does not affect the specific calculation.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
- If `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains `p3`. Otherwise, `x` becomes 1 and `y` becomes `p3 - 1`.

### Code Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(p1 - x + p3)
```

### Determining the Values:
1. **Initial Assumptions**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers.
   - `p3 < p1 + p2`.
   - The sum `p1 + p2 + p3` is odd.

2. **Determine `x` and `y`**:
   - The conditions for `x` and `y` are:
     - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains `p3`.
     - Otherwise, `x` becomes 1 and `y` becomes `p3 - 1`.

3. **Calculate `p1 - x + p3`**:
   - Since `x` can either be 0 or 1, we need to consider both cases:
     - **Case 1: `x = 0`**
       - If `x = 0`, the expression becomes `p1 + p3`.
     - **Case 2: `x = 1`**
       - If `x = 1`, the expression becomes `p1 - 1 + p3`.

### Conclusion:
The value printed depends on the value of `x`, which in turn depends on the initial values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

- If `p1 - 0 <= p2 - p3` (i.e., `p1 <= p2 - p3`), then `x` remains 0, and the output is `p1 + p3`.
- Otherwise, `x` becomes 1, and the output is `p1 - 1 + p3`.

Since we don't have specific values for `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, we can't determine the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions:

Output: **p1 + p3 if p1 <= p2 - p3, otherwise p1 - 1 + p3**
