To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and how it processes the input.

The loop is structured as follows:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
    print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
```

### Explanation of the Loop:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each iteration, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input.
3. **Calculation**:
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` calculates the integer division of each count by 2, which represents the number of pairs for each number.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders when each count is divided by 2 equals 3. This condition is true only when all three of `a`, `b`, and `c` are odd, and `d` is even (or vice versa for `d` being odd). If true, it adds 1 to the total.

### Output State:
The output state after each iteration is a single integer printed by the loop, which is the result of the above calculation.

### Final Output State:
The final output state after all iterations is the sequence of integers printed by the loop for each test case. Each printed integer corresponds to the result of the calculation for one test case.

### Example:
If the input is:
```
3
1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8
9 10 11 12
```

The output would be:
```
5
12
21
```

### Conclusion:
The final output state consists of a sequence of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for one test case.

**Output State: **a sequence of integers, each representing the result of the calculation for one test case.**

In natural language, the final output state is a series of numbers, where each number is the result of processing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours for each test case according to the specified formula.
