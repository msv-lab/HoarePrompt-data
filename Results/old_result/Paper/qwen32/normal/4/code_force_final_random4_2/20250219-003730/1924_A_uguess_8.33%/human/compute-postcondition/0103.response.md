The code snippet provided is simply reading an input string `s` from the user. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cur`, `tmp`, `cnt`, `i`, `ans`) are modified in this snippet. Therefore, the only change is that the variable `s` is updated to the value provided by the input.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `cur`, `tmp`, `cnt`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values; `s` is the input string.**
