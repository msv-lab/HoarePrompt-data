The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`), but these do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `1 <= k <= n`.
   - `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
   - `pos` is the index `low` where `arr[low]` equals `k`.
   - `low` is the index where `arr[low]` equals `k` if such an `i` exists within the range `[0, n-1]`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
   - `high` is `low + 1`.
   - `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the loop.

2. **Condition**:
   - The current value of `arr[low]` equals `k`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(0)` statement will output the integer `0` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, or `st`.

Output: **0**
