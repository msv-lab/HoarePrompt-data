Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[0]`, then `x` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `x` and we do not break out of the loop.**
