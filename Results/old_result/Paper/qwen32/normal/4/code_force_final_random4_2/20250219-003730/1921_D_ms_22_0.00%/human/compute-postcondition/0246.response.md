Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where each `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where each `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. If the program is executed as the main module (`__name__ == '__main__'`), then `t` is set to 0, `max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is set to `m`, `tp2` is set to -1, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of differences for all test cases. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**
