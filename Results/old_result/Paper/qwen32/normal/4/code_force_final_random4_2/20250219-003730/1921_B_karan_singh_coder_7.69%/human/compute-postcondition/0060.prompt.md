Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5. s and f are strings of length n, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    s1 = s.count('1')
    t1 = t.count('1')
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += s[i] != t[i]
    if s1 == t1:
        print(s1 if cnt else 0)
    else:
        d = abs(s1 - t1)
        print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a string provided by the user input, `n` is the input integer, `s` is the string provided by the user input, `f` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the string `t`, and `cnt` is the number of positions where `s` and `t` differ. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, the state remains as described. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute value of `s1 - t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is the new string provided by the user input, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the new string provided by the user input, `f` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `s1` is the count of '1's in the new string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the string `t`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the new string provided by the user input, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is the new string provided by the user input, `f` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the string `t`, and `cnt` is the total number of positions where `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `s1` is equal to `t1`, then no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
