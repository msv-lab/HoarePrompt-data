Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n]; `x` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `l` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `i` is `i_end + 1` where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i_end + 1` must be less than `x`. If `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, then `flag` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged and no break occurs.**
