Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is `i` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` for any `i` in the range of the loop, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.`**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `t` remains unchanged. The value of `temp` will be the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` first becomes true, or it will remain -1 if this condition never becomes true during the loop. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences `abs(a[i] - b[i])` calculated for each iteration of the loop up to the point where the loop either breaks or completes. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged throughout the process.
