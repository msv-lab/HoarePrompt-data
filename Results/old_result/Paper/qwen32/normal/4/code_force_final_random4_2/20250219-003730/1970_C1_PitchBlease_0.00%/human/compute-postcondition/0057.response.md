Output State: **The function either returns the distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is found, or it returns nothing (implicitly `None`) if `target` is not reachable from `start`. The `queue` is empty, and `visited` contains all nodes reachable from `start`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the function will either return the shortest distance from the starting node to the target node if the target is reachable. If the target is not reachable, the function will complete without returning any value, implying `None`. At the end of the loop, the queue will be empty because all reachable nodes have been processed, and the visited set will include all nodes that could be reached starting from the initial node.
