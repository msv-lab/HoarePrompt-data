Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

1. **`ver`**: This variable holds the value of the element that was at the front of the queue `q` before any operation was performed. This means that `ver` is the first element that was dequeued from `q`.

2. **`graph`**: The graph remains unchanged, so it does not affect the print statement directly.

3. **`vis`**: This variable is a list (or array) that has 1s for all nodes that are adjacent to `ver` and were not previously visited. This information is not directly relevant to the print statement.

4. **`q`**: The queue `q` now contains the elements that were originally in `q` excluding the first element (which is `ver`).

Given the print statement:
```python
print(ver, end=' ')
```

- The `print` function will output the value of `ver`.
- The `end=' '` argument ensures that a space is printed after the value of `ver` instead of a newline.

Since `ver` is the value of the element that was at the front of `q` before the operation, the output will be the value of that element followed by a space.

Output: **ver (where ver is the value of the element that was at the front of q before the operation) followed by a space**
