The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state only mentions `t` as an integer representing the number of test cases. Since the input operation directly assigns values to `a`, `b`, and `m`, these variables will hold the specific integer values provided in the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by the input.**
