The given code snippet initializes two variables `l` and `r` to specific values. `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to the length of the array `n`. The initial state specifies that `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and `find` is an integer that needs to be found in the permutation.

The code does not affect the values of `array` or `find`, and it only changes the values of `l` and `r`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `l` is 0; `r` is `n`.**
