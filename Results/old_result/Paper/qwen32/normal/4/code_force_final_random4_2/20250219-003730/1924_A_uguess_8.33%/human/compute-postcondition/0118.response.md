Postcondition: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `tmp`, `i`, `ans` remain the same as their initial values. `cnt` is 0 if `cur` was not equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, otherwise `cnt` is 1. `cur_ss` is the position of the third element of `s` in the alphabet. `cur` is `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` if `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0` and `cur` was not 0, otherwise `cur` is `1 << cur_ss` if `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0` and `cur` was 0. `ss` is the third element of `s`.**
