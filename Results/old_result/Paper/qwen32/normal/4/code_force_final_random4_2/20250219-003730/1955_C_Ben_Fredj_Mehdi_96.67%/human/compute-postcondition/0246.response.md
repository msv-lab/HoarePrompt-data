The code snippet `d -= 1` decrements the value of `d` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `z` is 2, `a` is a list with the element at index `g` decremented by 1, the element at index `d` of `a` is decremented by 1, `g` is incremented by 1 if `a[g]` was 0, `d` is decremented to `len(a) - 2` if the last element of `a` was 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same, and `d` is decremented by 1.**
