The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value such that `0 <= i < n`, `max_item_idx` is `i` if `ans` equals '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` remains 0, and `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, i, i)` which equals '<' if the if condition is met.

For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `max_item_idx` is `i` if `ans` equals '<', otherwise `max_item_idx` remains 0, `ans` is the result of `func_1(0, 0, i, i)` which equals '<' if the if condition is met, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we only adjust the variables in the loop head, the final adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, `i` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration**.
