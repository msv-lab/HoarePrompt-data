Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is the final constructed string based on the alternating characters from `a` and `b`, `i` is at least 2, `work` is False, `counter` is 2, and the character at index `j + 1` in `a` is equal to the character at index `j` in `b`.**

The value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
