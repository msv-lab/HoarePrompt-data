To determine what will be printed by the `print(k - 1)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and identify the relevant information:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but its value is not directly relevant to the `print(k - 1)` statement.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.
- `l` is a new list of integers from the input.
- `p` is a list of counts of each unique element in `l`.

The `print(k - 1)` statement directly depends on the value of `k`. Since `k` is described as the second integer from the new input, we can denote it as a specific integer value that is provided during the execution of the program. However, the exact value of `k` is not specified in the initial state, so we will describe the output in terms of `k`.

Given the above, the output of the `print(k - 1)` statement will be the value of `k` minus 1.

Output: **k - 1 (where k is the second integer from the new input)**
