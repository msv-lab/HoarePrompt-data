The code snippet modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of `(n + i) // cnt` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 2` and `cnt` is `(i + 2) * (i + 2)`, we can substitute these values into the expression.

Since `i` is `i + 2`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 2`. Consequently, `cnt` becomes `cnt = i_new * i_new`.

The expression `(n + i) // cnt` now becomes `(n + i_new) // (i_new * i_new)`. The value of `ans` is updated by adding this result to it.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `root` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `(i + 2) * (i + 2)`, `ans` is updated by adding `(n + (i + 2)) // ((i + 2) * (i + 2))` to it.**
