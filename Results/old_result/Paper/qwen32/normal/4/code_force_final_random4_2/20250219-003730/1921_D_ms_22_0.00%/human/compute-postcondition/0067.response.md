The loop condition for the `while` loop is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `max_heap` is not empty. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `max_heap` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `m` is an integer obtained from the split input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element.
- `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input.
- `max_heap` is a list containing tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` for each element `i` in `a`, with one element removed.
- `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`.
- The logic for updating `tp1`, `tp2`, and `ans` based on `item` is provided.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `max_heap` still contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust `max_heap` to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer obtained from the split input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one element; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the split input; `max_heap` must contain at least one element; `item` is the tuple with the largest `diff` value from the original `max_heap`.**
