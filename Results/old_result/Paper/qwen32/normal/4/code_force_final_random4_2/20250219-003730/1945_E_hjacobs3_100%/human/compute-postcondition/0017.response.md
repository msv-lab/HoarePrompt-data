The code snippet `r = mid` updates the value of `r` to be equal to `mid`. The other variables (`array`, `find`, `l`, and `mid`) remain unchanged. Since `mid` is defined as `(l + r) // 2`, and now `r` is set to `mid`, the new value of `r` is `(l + r) // 2`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `r` is `(l + r) // 2`; `mid` is the integer value `(l + r) // 2`.**
