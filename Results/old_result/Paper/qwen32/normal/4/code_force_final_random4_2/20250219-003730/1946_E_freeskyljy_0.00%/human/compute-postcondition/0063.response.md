To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to carefully analyze the loop and its behavior given the initial conditions and the outputs after the first few iterations.

The loop runs while `i < N`. Given the initial state and the outputs after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - `i` starts at `2` if `M1` is not greater than 1, or `3` if `M1` is greater than 1.
   - `nums_left` starts at `-1` if `M1` is not greater than 1, or `L[-1] - N + 2` if `M1` is greater than 1.
   - `cur` starts at `1`.
   - `ans` starts at `final_computed_ans`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < N`.
   - If `i == R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(ans * nums_left) % MOD`.
   - `nums_left` is decremented by 1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Outputs after Iterations:**
   - **After 1 iteration:** `i` is `3` if `M1 > 1`, otherwise `2`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N + 1` if `M1 > 1`, otherwise `-1`. `cur` is `2` if `i == R[cur]` was true, otherwise `1`. `ans` remains `final_computed_ans` if `i == R[cur]` was true, otherwise it is updated.
   - **After 2 iterations:** `i` is `4` if `M1 > 1`, otherwise `3`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N` if `M1 > 1`, otherwise `-1`. `cur` and `ans` are updated based on the condition `i == R[cur]`.
   - **After 3 iterations:** `i` is `5` if `M1 > 1`, otherwise `4`. `nums_left` is `L[-1] - N - 1` if `M1 > 1`, otherwise `-1`. `cur` and `ans` are updated based on the condition `i == R[cur]`.

Given that `N` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute at least 3 times, the loop will execute `N-2` times if `M1 > 1` and `N-1` times if `M1 <= 1`.

4. **Final Output State:**
   - After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `N`.
   - `nums_left` will be `L[-1] - N + 2 - (N - 2) = L[-1] - 2*N + 4` if `M1 > 1`, otherwise it remains `-1`.
   - `cur` will be incremented each time `i == R[cur]` is true, up to the point where `cur` reaches the end of `R`.
   - `ans` will be updated each time `i != R[cur]` is true, multiplying `ans` by `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`.

Since the exact values of `L`, `R`, `M1`, `M2`, and `final_computed_ans` are not provided, we can only describe the final state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`i` is `N`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2*N + 4` if `M1 > 1`, otherwise `-1`, `cur` is the number of times `i == R[cur]` was true plus 1, `ans` is updated based on the condition `i != R[cur]` during each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop variable `i` will have reached `N`, `nums_left` will have been decremented appropriately based on the initial value and the number of iterations, `cur` will reflect how many times the loop index matched an element in `R`, and `ans` will have been updated based on the condition `i != R[cur]` during each iteration.
