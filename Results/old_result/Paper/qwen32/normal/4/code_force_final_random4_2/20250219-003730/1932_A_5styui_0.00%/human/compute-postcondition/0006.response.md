Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `path` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '@', or '*', where the first character is '.'; `a` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `s` is 0; `d` is an input integer; `b` is an input string that must have at least one character. Additionally, `b[j]` is equal to '@'.**
