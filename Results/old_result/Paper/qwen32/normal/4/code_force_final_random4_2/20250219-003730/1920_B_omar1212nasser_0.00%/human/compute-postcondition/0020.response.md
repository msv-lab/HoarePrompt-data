The code snippet `s -= elements[-i]` modifies the value of `s` by subtracting the element at the index `-i` from the list `elements`. Given that `i` is 3, the code subtracts `elements[-3]` from `s`.

Let's break down the changes:
- `s` is initially `s - elements[-2] - elements[-2]`.
- After the code executes, `s` becomes `s - elements[-2] - elements[-2] - elements[-3]`.

The other variables (`removals`, `n`, `pos`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`removals` is 2, `s` is `s - elements[-2] - elements[-2] - elements[-3]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + 2)] - elements[-2]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` has elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, `i` is 3**.
