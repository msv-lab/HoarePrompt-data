Postcondition: **`l` is 1 and `r` is at least 2, or `l` is 0 and `r` is at least 1, and `k` is greater than 0; `a[l]` is reduced by `mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`; `k` is reduced by `mi * 2`. If `a[l]` was initially 0, `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1.**
