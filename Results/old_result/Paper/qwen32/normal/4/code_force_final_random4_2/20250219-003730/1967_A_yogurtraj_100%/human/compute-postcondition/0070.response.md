The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `ii + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be `ii + 2`.

The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is the total number of elements in the list `a` and is not modified within the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `i` is `ii + 2`**.
