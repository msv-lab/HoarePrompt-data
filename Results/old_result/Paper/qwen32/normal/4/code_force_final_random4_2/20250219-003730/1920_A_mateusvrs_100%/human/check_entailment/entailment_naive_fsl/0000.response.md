Let's analyze the provided program to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes a series of constraints and determines the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cx`: A set to store all integers that `k` must not be equal to.
   - `ax`: Initialized to a large value (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound.
   - `bx`: Initialized to a small value (`-1`) to represent the lower bound.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint type is `1` (k must be greater than or equal to x), update `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`.
     - If the constraint type is `2` (k must be less than or equal to x), update `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`.
     - If the constraint type is `3` (k must not be equal to x), add `x` to the set `cx`.

3. **Checking Validity**:
   - If `bx` (lower bound) is greater than `ax` (upper bound), it means there are no valid integers `k` that can satisfy all constraints, so the result is `0`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, append the result to the list `r` and finally print all results.

### Verification

The code appears to handle all the required cases as per the problem description. Here are the key points to verify:

- **Initialization**: The initial values for `ax` and `bx` ensure that they cover the entire range of possible integers initially.
- **Constraint Processing**: The logic correctly updates the bounds and records the excluded integers.
- **Range Calculation**: The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid integers `k` after excluding those in `cx`.

### Edge Cases
- **No Valid Range**: If `bx` exceeds `ax` after processing the constraints, the code correctly returns `0`.
- **No Excluded Integers**: If there are no constraints of type `3`, the code correctly computes the entire range.
- **All Excluded Integers in Range**: If all integers in the range `[bx, ax]` are excluded, the result should be `0`.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering the problem description and potential edge cases, it seems that the program correctly handles all scenarios described.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly processes the constraints, updates the bounds, and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It handles edge cases where there are no valid integers or all integers in the range are excluded.
