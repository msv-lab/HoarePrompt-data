The code `d = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `d`. The values of `k`, `i`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`k` is either `b` or `j + 1`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `b` and `c` are the integers obtained from the input; `d` is the value obtained from the input.**
