Postcondition: **`start` is an integer representing the starting node of the BFS, `target` is an integer representing the target node in the tree, `tree` is an adjacency list representation of the tree where `tree[current]` is a non-empty list, `queue` is a deque. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` contains the newly added tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` and `visited` includes `unvisited_node` and `neighbor`. If `neighbor` is in `visited`, `queue` and `visited` remain unchanged. `current` is the first value of the popped tuple from `queue`, and `dist` is the second value of the popped tuple from `queue`.**
