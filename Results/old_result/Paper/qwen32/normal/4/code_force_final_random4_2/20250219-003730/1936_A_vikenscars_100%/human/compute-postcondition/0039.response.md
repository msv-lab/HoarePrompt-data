The code snippet assigns a new value to `ans2` by calling `func_1` with the arguments `pair_idx`, `pair_idx`, `i`, and `i`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`**.

In natural language, this means that the variable `ans2` now holds the result of the function `func_1` called with `pair_idx` as the first two arguments and `i` as the last two arguments. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans1` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
