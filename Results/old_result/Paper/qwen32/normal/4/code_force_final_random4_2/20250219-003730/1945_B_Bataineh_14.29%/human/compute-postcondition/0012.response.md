Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4; `i` is incremented by 1; `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input. Regardless of whether `m < a` or `m < b`, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain the same after the if-else block execution.**
