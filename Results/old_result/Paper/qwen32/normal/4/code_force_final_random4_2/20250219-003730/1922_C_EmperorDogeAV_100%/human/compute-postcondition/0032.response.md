The code snippet provided sets the value of `prog_cities[i]` to 1. This change does not affect the values of `i`, `back`, `forward`, or `n`. The states of `back` and `forward` are still dependent on the value of `i` relative to `n` and the `cities` list as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `back` is set to `cities[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `back` remains -99999999999999999999. If `i < n - 1`, `forward` is set to `cities[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `forward` remains 999999999999999999. `prog_cities[i]` is 1.**
