Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 <= a_j < 2^31 for each `j`, `res` is 2 or 1 (depending on its previous value), `count` is a dictionary reflecting the state from the previous iteration with the count of the key `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` incremented by 1, `num` is `a[i]` where `i` is the index of the next element to be processed in the list `a`.**

Natural Language: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, so if it was previously 0, it is now 1, and if it was previously 1, it is now 2. All other variables retain their previous values.
