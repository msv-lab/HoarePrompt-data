Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

**Problem Understanding:**
- We are given `n` containers of water, each with an initial amount of water.
- The sum of all water in the containers is divisible by `n`.
- We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
- The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

**Key Insight:**
- The sum of all water is divisible by `n`, so there exists a target amount `target = total_water // n` such that each container should ideally have `target` units of water.
- To achieve this, we need to ensure that at any point during the process of pouring water, we do not end up with a negative amount of water in any container. If we can pour water from left to right without ever dipping below zero, it means we can achieve the desired distribution.

**Code Analysis:**
- The code first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount each container should have.
- It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running sum (`container`) that represents the net amount of water that would be left if we were to pour water from left to right to achieve the target.
- If at any point this running sum becomes negative, it means we cannot achieve the desired distribution, and the function returns 'No'.
- If the loop completes without the running sum going negative, it returns 'Yes'.

**Correctness of the Code:**
- The code correctly implements the key insight mentioned above.
- It checks if it's possible to pour water from left to right without ever having a negative amount of water, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the problem.
- The code handles the input as described and outputs the correct result based on the logic.

Therefore, the provided code is correct.

**Final Answer:**
Reasoning: The code correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the given operation.
Correctness: **True**
