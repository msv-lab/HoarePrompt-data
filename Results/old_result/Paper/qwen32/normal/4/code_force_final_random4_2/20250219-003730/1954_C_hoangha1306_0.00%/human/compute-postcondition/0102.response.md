Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a string with at least one character, `b` is the new input string, `q` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1. If `a[i] == b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each updated to include the character at index 1 of string `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`. If `vt` was 0, `vt` is now 1. `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` if `a[i] > b[i]`, otherwise `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`.**
