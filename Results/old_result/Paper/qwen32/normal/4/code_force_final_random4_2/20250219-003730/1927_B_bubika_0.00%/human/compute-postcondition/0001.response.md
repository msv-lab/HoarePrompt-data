The code snippet initializes a list `b` with 26 zeros. This action does not affect the variables `t`, `n`, or the string `a`. Therefore, the Output State remains with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` still being an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `a` remaining the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The new variable `b` is a list of 26 zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros**.
