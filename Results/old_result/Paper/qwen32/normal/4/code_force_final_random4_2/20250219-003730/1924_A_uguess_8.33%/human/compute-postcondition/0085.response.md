The variable `ans` is updated to be a string consisting of the character `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **After the loop completes, `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `cur`, and `tmp` remain unchanged. `ans` is a string of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.**
