To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code execution step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- For each test case, we have two integers `n` and `k`.
- `k` remains 1 if it is initially 1. If `k` is not 1, it retains its original value.
- `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`.

### Code Execution:
- The code snippet provided is `print(math.ceil(k / 2))`.

### Analysis:
- The function `math.ceil(x)` returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x`.
- `k / 2` is the division of `k` by 2.
- Since `k` is an integer, `k / 2` can be either an integer or a float (if `k` is odd).
- `math.ceil(k / 2)` will round up `k / 2` to the nearest integer.

### Possible Values of `k`:
- If `k` is 1, then `k / 2` is 0.5, and `math.ceil(0.5)` is 1.
- If `k` is 2, then `k / 2` is 1.0, and `math.ceil(1.0)` is 1.
- If `k` is 3, then `k / 2` is 1.5, and `math.ceil(1.5)` is 2.
- If `k` is 4, then `k / 2` is 2.0, and `math.ceil(2.0)` is 2.
- And so on...

### General Case:
- For any integer `k`, `math.ceil(k / 2)` will give the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `k` are not provided, we can describe the output based on the behavior of the `math.ceil(k / 2)` function.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2) (where k is an integer and math.ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2)**
