The code snippet provided is simply an assignment statement that assigns the value of `s1[i]` to the variable `el`. None of the other variables are affected by this single line of code. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the assignment of `el` to `s1[i]`.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is updated based on the value of `el` where it is reduced by 1 if `el` is '>'; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, and the last element is removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing elements that are accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` and `zr` are updated based on the value of `el` and the conditions provided; `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`; `fi` is calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, and `preOne`; `i` is `k - 2`; `el` is `s1[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that `el` now holds the value of `s1[i]`, which is either '<' or '>'. All other variables remain unchanged.
