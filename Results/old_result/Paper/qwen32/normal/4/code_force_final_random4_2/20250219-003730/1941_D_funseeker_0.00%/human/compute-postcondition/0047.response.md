The code snippet `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. This means that `ans` will now contain all the computed values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c` that were previously stored in `temp`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains all computed values `(q + r) % n` and/or `(q - r) % n` based on the value of `c`, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]`, and `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]`.**
