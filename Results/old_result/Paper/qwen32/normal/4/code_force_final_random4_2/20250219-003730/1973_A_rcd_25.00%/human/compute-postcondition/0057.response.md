Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Since the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is already given to be odd, the else part will never execute, and thus the state of the variables remains unchanged after the if-else block.**
