To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the condition `r - l > 1`.

Given:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
- `find` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{find} \leq n\).
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n`.

The loop condition is `r - l > 1`. For the loop to execute, this condition must be true. Let's break it down:

- `l` is initialized to 0.
- `r` is initialized to `n`.

So, for the loop to execute, we need:
\[ r - l > 1 \]
\[ n - 0 > 1 \]
\[ n > 1 \]

Thus, the only variable we need to adjust is `n` to ensure that it is greater than 1. The other variables `array` and `find` are not part of the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the modified state should be:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `l` is 0; `r` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1**
