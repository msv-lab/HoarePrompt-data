### Reasoning:

The provided code is designed to determine if a given subarray of integers can be split into more than one segment such that the bitwise XOR of each segment is equal.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code and its correctness based on the problem description:

1. **Input Handling (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and converts each element to the specified type (`int` in this case). This function is used to read the number of test cases, the size of the array, the number of queries, and the elements of the array and queries themselves.

2. **Binary Search (`func_2`)**:
   - `func_2` performs a binary search on a list `arr` to find the largest index `l` such that `predicate(arr[l])` is `True`. This function is used to find specific indices in the list of indices (`inds`) where the cumulative XOR values match the current subarray's XOR value.

3. **Wrapper for Binary Search (`func_3`)**:
   - `func_3` is a simple wrapper around `func_2`, passing the same arguments. This function is not necessary in this context and could be removed without affecting the logic.

4. **Adjusted Binary Search (`func_4`)**:
   - `func_4` also calls `func_2` but adjusts the result by adding 1 if `func_2` does not return `None`. This adjustment is likely to convert 0-based indices to 1-based indices, which is useful for the problem's context.

5. **Main Processing (`func_5`)**:
   - `func_5` reads the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `a`. It then computes the cumulative XOR values for the array and stores the indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs in a dictionary `inds`.
   - For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR values at the start and end of the subarray are the same. If they are, it prints "Yes".
   - If not, it uses `func_4` and `func_3` to find indices in `inds` that can help determine if the subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values. If such indices exist, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Correctness:

The logic in the code is sound and follows the problem description. The use of cumulative XOR values and binary search to find appropriate indices is an efficient way to determine if a subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values.

- **Cumulative XOR Calculation**: The cumulative XOR values are correctly computed and stored, allowing for quick comparisons.
- **Index Lookup with Binary Search**: The use of binary search to find the appropriate indices in `inds` is efficient and correctly implemented.
- **Query Handling**: The handling of each query checks the necessary conditions and uses the helper functions appropriately to determine if the subarray is interesting.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a subarray can be split into segments with equal XOR values. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
