To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `i < n`. The variables `i` and `n` are the only ones that can be adjusted according to the problem statement.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
- `counter` is 0.
- `i` is 0.

The loop condition is `i < n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (minimum value of 1), and `i` is initialized to 0, the condition `i < n` will be true for the first iteration. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0's and '1's, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0**
