The code snippet provided is:

```python
cliquess[left + i] = clique
```

This line of code assigns the value of `clique` to the element in the `cliquess` list at the index `left + i`.

Given the initial state, the value of `cliquess[left + i]` is already `clique`. Therefore, executing this line of code does not change the value of `cliquess[left + i]` since it is already set to `clique`.

Since no other variables are modified, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that we can confirm the assignment operation did not change the value.

Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `(left + 1) + i`, `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration**.
