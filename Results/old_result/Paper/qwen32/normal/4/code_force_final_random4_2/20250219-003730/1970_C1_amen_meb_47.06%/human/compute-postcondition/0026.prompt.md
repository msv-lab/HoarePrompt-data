You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, the next n-1 lines contain pairs of integers (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n representing the edges of the tree, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1 where 1 <= u_1 <= n, representing the starting node of the game. `numbers` is a list containing all the pairs of integers read before the loop breaks.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list `numbers` containing all the pairs of integers (u, v) that represent the edges of the tree. Each pair (u, v) satisfies 1 <= u, v <= n, and there are exactly n-1 such pairs since the tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is always 1, a list of `n-1` pairs of integers `(u, v)` representing the edges of the tree, and a single integer `u_1` representing the starting node of the game. The function returns a list of all the pairs of integers `(u, v)` that represent the edges of the tree.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `numbers` containing all the pairs of integers (u, v) that represent the edges of the tree. Each pair (u, v) satisfies 1 <= u, v <= n, and there are exactly n-1 such pairs since the tree has exactly n nodes and n-1 edges.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
