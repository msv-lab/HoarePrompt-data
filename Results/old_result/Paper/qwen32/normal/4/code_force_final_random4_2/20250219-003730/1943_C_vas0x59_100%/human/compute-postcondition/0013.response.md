The code appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Given the initial state, the list at index `v` contains the elements `u` and `u`. After appending `u` to this list, the list at index `v` will contain the elements `u`, `u`, and `u`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains the elements `u`, `u`, and `u`, the list at index `u` contains the elements `u`, `u`, and `v`, and all other lists remain empty; `u` is the first integer read from input minus 2; `v` is the second integer read from input minus 2.**
