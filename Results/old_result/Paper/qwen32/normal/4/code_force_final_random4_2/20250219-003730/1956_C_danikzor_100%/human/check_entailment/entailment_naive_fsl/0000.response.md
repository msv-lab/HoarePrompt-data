Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program outputs a specific sequence of operations for each test case without considering whether those operations are optimal to achieve the maximum sum. Specifically, the program uses the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` for both row and column operations, but this is not necessarily the optimal permutation for maximizing the sum.

To maximize the sum of the matrix, the optimal strategy is to fill the matrix with the numbers from 1 to n in such a way that each number from 1 to n appears exactly n times (once in each row and once in each column). One way to achieve this is to fill the matrix in a way that each row and each column is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n. The simplest such permutation is the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Here is a counterexample to show that the provided program is not correct:

**Input:**
```
1
2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
7 3
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
The maximum sum for a 2x2 matrix is 7, which can be achieved by setting the matrix as:
```
1 2
2 1
```
This can be done with the following operations:
1. `1 1 1 2` (Set the first row to [1, 2])
2. `1 2 1 2` (Set the second row to [1, 2])
3. `2 1 1 2` (Set the first column to [1, 2])

**Program Output:**
```
7 3
1 1 2 1
1 2 2 1
2 1 2 1
2 2 2 1
```

**Explanation of Program Output:**
The program sets the matrix as:
```
2 1
2 1
```
This results in a sum of 6, which is not the maximum possible sum.

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct maximum sum for all possible input cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
