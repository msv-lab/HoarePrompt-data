The code provided initializes the variable `pos` to -1. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `arr`, which remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is simply the initial state with the addition of the `pos` variable being set to -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1**.
