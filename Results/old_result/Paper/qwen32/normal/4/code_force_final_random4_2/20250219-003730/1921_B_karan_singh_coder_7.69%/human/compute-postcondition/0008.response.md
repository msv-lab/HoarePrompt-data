The code snippet `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments the variable `cnt` by 1 if the characters at the `i`-th position in the strings `s` and `t` are not equal. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a string provided by the user input, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is the string provided by the user input, `f` is a string of length `n` where each character is either '0' or '1', `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1's in the string `t`, `cnt` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is not equal to `t[i]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `cnt` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the characters at the `i`-th position in `s` and `t` are different. All other variables remain the same.
