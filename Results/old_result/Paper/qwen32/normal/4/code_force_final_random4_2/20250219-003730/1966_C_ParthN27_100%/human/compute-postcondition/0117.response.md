The `print('Bob')` statement will print the string `'Bob'`. The variables and objects mentioned in the initial state (such as `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`) do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement is printing a fixed string, not any of the variables.

Output: **Bob**
