The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the `coord` list. Therefore, `coord` now contains three tuples instead of two. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are still the integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` must be non-zero; `coord` is a list containing three tuples `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x, y)]`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is undefined; `p2` is undefined; `x` and `y` are the integers provided by the input.**
