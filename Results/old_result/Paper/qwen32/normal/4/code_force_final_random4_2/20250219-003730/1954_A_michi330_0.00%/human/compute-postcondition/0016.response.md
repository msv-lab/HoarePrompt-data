The given initial state describes several variables (`t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, `k`) but the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('Yes')`. This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `itest`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, the code will always print the string `'Yes'`.

Let's break it down:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `itest` is set to 2.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
