Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, and `i` is less than `n`; `counter` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `counter` is increased by 1. All other variables (`n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `i`) retain their original values.
