The provided code snippet defines a lambda function `I` which reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and returns the result as a list of integers. This function does not modify any existing variables or states but provides a way to read input for further processing.

Given the initial state, the lambda function `I` has been defined but not yet used. Therefore, the values of `n` and the permutation `p` remain unchanged. The function's definition does not affect the values of `n` or `p`.

Output State: **There are multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴) representing the length of a permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For each test case, the function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in p, and must identify a pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. `I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split string to an integer, and returns the result as a list of integers.**
