Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `2n + 5`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is `int(data[n + 4])`; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are `int(data[n + 5])` to `int(data[2n + 4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `2n + 7`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are `int(data[n + 5])` to `int(data[2n + 4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries, with an additional 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise 'NO'; `l` is `int(data[2n + 5])`; `r` is `int(data[2n + 6])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `[r]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is either `0` or `1` depending on whether `l` is less than or equal to `r` or greater than `r`; `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `2n + 9`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is an integer greater than 0; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are `int(data[n + 5])` to `int(data[2n + 4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`; `results` is a list containing the results of all `q` queries with an additional 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, otherwise it includes an additional 'NO'; `l` is `int(data[2n + 7])`; `r` is `int(data[2n + 8])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is not less than `l` (found using `bisect_left`); `it2` is the index of the largest element in `v2` that is less than or equal to `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings containing at least `2n + 5` elements; `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1; `index` is `2n + 11`; `n` is `int(data[n + 3])`; `q` is an integer greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are `int(data[n + 5])` to `int(data[2n + 4])`; `pf` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except the first `n` elements which are the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that point; `mp` is a defaultdict with a default factory of list and `mp[pf[i]]` contains `[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`; `l` is `int(data[2n + 9])`; `r` is `int(data[2n + 10])`; `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index of the first element in `v1` that is not less than `l`; `it2` is the index of the largest element in `v2` that is less than or equal to `r`. The `results` list is updated with an additional 'YES' if `it1 < len(v1)`, `it2 >= 0`, and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`; otherwise, it is updated with an additional 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
