Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as described in the problem statement. The provided program performs operations that fill the matrix with a descending permutation in both rows and columns, which does not necessarily yield the maximum possible sum.

To maximize the sum of the matrix, we should aim to fill the matrix with the maximum possible values in each row and column. One effective way to do this is to use the identity permutation for both row and column operations, which will fill the matrix with the values 1 through n in each row and column, ensuring that each cell in the matrix contains the highest possible value.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))
        print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

In this corrected version, the program performs the following steps:
- It calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix, which is the sum of the first n natural numbers repeated n times for each row and column.
- It then performs 2n operations, filling each row and each column with the identity permutation [1, 2, ..., n].

This ensures that the matrix is filled with the highest possible values, thus maximizing the sum.
