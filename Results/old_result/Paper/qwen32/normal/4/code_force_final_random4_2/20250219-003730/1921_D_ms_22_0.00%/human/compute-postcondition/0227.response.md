Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is not empty and contains at least one tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` except the one that was popped; `item` is a tuple of the form `(-max_diff, i, index_in_b)` that was popped from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by `max_diff`; if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
