The value of `cnt` is assigned the value of `i * i`. The value of `i` is `i + 2`, and `root` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 2`, `root` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is `(i + 2) * (i + 2)`.
Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `root` remains unchanged, `cnt` is `(i + 2) * (i + 2)`**.
