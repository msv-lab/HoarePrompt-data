The given code calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the first two points in the `coord` list and assigns it to the variable `p1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, and the newly read integers `x` and `y` are not affected by this calculation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is a non-zero integer; `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `x` and `y` are the new integers read from the input; `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`.**
