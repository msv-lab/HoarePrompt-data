The code snippet provided increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, if `cnt` was previously `1` (which means `cur` was updated to `(1 << k) - 1` before the operation), it will now be `2`. If `cnt` was previously `0`, it will now be `1`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cnt` is `2` if `cur` was updated to `(1 << k) - 1` before the operation; otherwise, `cnt` is `1`; `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. If `cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0`, then `cur` is its previous value plus `2` else `cur` remains unchanged.**
