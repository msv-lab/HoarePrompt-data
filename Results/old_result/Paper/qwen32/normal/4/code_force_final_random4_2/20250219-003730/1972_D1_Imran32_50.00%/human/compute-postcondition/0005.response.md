The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(n + i) // cnt`. Given that `cnt` is `i * i`, the expression becomes `(n + i) // (i * i)`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but `ans` is modified.

Output State: **`cnt` is `i * i`, `i` is unchanged, `ans` is updated to `ans + (n + i) // (i * i)`**.
