The code snippet assigns the value of `chr(ord('a') + i)` to `tmp`. This means that `tmp` will now hold a character that is `i` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `cnt` is less than `n` and holds the number of times a sequence of `k` distinct characters was found in the string `s`, `cur` will be 0 if the last processed subset of `k` distinct characters completed a sequence, or it will be a value reflecting the bits of the characters processed since the last completed sequence, and the `i`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `tmp` is the character that is `i` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table, `ans` is a string consisting of the character that is `k-1` positions after 'a' in the ASCII table, repeated `cnt` times.**
