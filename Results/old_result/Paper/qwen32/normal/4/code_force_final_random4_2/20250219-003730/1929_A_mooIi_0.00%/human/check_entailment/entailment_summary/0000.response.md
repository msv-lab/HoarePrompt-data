Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to determine the maximum beauty of the array, which is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum. The beauty of the array is maximized when the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order. However, the program simply sorts the array in ascending order and prints the sorted array, which does not provide the maximum beauty value.

To correctly solve the problem, after sorting the array, we should calculate the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements. For example, if the sorted array is [a1, a2, ..., an], the beauty would be (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - an-1), which simplifies to an - a1.

Therefore, the program should be modified to compute and print this value instead of just printing the sorted array.

Correctness: **False**
