The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be increased by 1 from its previous value.

Given that `i` was some value less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1 for the next iteration. The other variables `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `res` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is `res + (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**
