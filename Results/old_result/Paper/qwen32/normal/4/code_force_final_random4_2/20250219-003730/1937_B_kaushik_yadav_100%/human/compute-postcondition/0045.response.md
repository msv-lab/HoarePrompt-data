The code snippet `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `b` to the existing value of `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the first character of `b` is appended to `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `work`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty stripped input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `work` is False, `i` is 0, `ans` is the first character of `b`**.
