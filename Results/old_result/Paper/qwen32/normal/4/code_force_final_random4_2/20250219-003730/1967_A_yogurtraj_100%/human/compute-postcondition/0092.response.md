The given code snippet only resets the variable `rem` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer provided by the current input; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `k` is the second integer provided by the current input; `r` is the first element of `a`.**
