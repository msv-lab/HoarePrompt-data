The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common placeholder indicating that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, its value does not affect the state of the program. The loop will execute `t` times, and at the start of each iteration, `_` takes on the next value in the range from 0 to `t-1`.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration is `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and the loop has just completed an iteration, the loop variable `_` would have taken on the value of the iteration just completed. To prepare for the next iteration, `_` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` should be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. Since we do not have the exact value of `_` from the previous iteration, we can denote the new value as the next integer in the sequence.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2**.

Since the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the program state outside the loop, and it is solely used for iteration, the other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`) remain unchanged. The state of `t` remains the same as it dictates the number of iterations.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.**
