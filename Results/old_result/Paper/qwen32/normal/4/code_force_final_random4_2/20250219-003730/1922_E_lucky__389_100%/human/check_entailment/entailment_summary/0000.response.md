### Reasoning:

The program aims to find an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach taken involves breaking down `X` into a sum of powers of 2, which suggests leveraging the properties of binary representation to construct the array.

#### Key Points:

1. **Binary Representation**: The program converts `X` into a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the binary representation of `X`. Each power of 2 corresponds to a specific combination of increasing subsequences.

2. **Constructing the Array**: The array is constructed based on the exponents of these powers of 2. The array contains elements that represent the positions of `1`s in the binary representation of `X`. This is because each `1` in the binary representation corresponds to a unique increasing subsequence.

3. **Special Case for X = 2**: The program correctly handles the special case where `X = 2` by outputting an array of length 1 with a single element `0`. This is because the only increasing subsequences of `[0]` are the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]` itself, totaling 2 subsequences.

4. **General Case**: For other values of `X`, the program constructs an array by appending the exponents of the powers of 2 that sum up to `X`. This ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

5. **Output Format**: The program correctly formats the output by first printing the length of the array, followed by the elements of the array.

#### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the edge case where `X = 1`, which is not specified in the problem constraints (`2 <= X <= 10^18`). However, since the problem constraints do not include `X = 1`, this is not a concern.

- **Array Length Constraint**: The constructed array length is at most 200, which aligns with the problem constraints. Since the maximum value of `X` is `10^18`, and the largest power of 2 less than `10^18` is `2^59`, the maximum number of terms in the sum is 60, which is well within the limit.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences based on the binary representation of `X`. It handles the special case for `X = 2` and constructs the array for other values of `X` within the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
