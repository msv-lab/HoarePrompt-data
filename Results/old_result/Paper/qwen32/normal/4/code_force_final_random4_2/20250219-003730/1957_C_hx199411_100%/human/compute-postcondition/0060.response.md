The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `dp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `num` is determined by whether `c` is equal to `r`.

Output State: **`t` is truthy and decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` remains 0 if it was 0, remains 1 if it was 1, and is set to 8 if it was greater than 1, `dp` is set to `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`, `i` is set to 2, `c` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `num` is 2 if `c` is equal to `r`, otherwise `num` is 4.**
