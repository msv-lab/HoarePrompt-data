The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that the last element of `a` is 0, it will be removed. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 999, `n` is the newly input integer, `a` is a list with at least one element (the last element, which was 0, has been removed), `res` is 0.**
