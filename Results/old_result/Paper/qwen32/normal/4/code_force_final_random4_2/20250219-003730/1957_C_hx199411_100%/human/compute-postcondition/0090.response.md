The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `dp`, `i`, `num`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is truthy - 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `dp` is a list where the first 9 elements are [0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937] and the rest are zeros if `m` is at least 8, `i` is `k` if `m` equals 1, otherwise `i` is `m + 1`, `num` is 0, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split.**
