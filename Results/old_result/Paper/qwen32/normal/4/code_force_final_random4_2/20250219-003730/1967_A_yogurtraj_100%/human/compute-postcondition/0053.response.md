The code snippet updates the value of `rem` by calculating the remainder of `k` divided by `(i + 1)`. All other variables retain their previous values or states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the first integer provided by the input and must be at least 1, `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the input, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is 0, `k` is the second integer provided by the input, `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**
