You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards you can have after performing the described operations. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly handling the frequency of card numbers, and the main logic does not properly compute the minimum number of cards based on the given operations.

Let's analyze a specific test case to demonstrate why this code is incorrect:

### Test Case Analysis
**Input:**
```
1
10 4
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Expected Output:**
```
3
```
**Explanation:**
- We have 10 cards, all numbered 1.
- We can perform the operation 2 times (since \(10 / 4 = 2\) with a remainder of 2).
- Each operation reduces the count of cards by 1 (since we exchange 4 cards for 3).
- After 2 operations, we will have \(10 - 2 = 8\) cards.
- We can perform the operation one more time, reducing the count to \(8 - 1 = 7\).
- We can perform the operation one more time, reducing the count to \(7 - 1 = 6\).
- We can perform the operation one more time, reducing the count to \(6 - 1 = 5\).
- We can perform the operation one more time, reducing the count to \(5 - 1 = 4\).
- We can perform the operation one more time, reducing the count to \(4 - 1 = 3\).

However, the code does not follow this logic. It incorrectly handles the frequency of card numbers and does not properly compute the minimum number of cards based on the given operations.

### Code Issues
1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling:** The function `func_1` limits the frequency of each card to `k`, which is not the correct approach.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation:** The main logic does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards based on the operations described.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. For each unique card number, determine how many operations can be performed (i.e., how many groups of `k` cards can be formed).
3. Each operation reduces the count of cards by 1.
4. Sum the remaining cards after performing all possible operations.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += count % k + (count // k if count % k != 0 else 0)
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected code properly handles the frequency of card numbers and computes the minimum number of cards after performing the operations.
