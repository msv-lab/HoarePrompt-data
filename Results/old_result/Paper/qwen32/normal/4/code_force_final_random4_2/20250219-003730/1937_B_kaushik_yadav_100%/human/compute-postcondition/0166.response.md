Postcondition: **`j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the final count based on the loop conditions, `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the next input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is True, and if `i` is 0, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with the first character of `b` and the loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, `ans` is the first character of `a` and `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` with `b[i]` not less than `a[i + 1]`.**
