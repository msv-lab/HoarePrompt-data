To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which is `i` in this case.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `m` is an integer obtained from the input.
- `temp` is set to `i` if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`; otherwise, `temp` remains -1.
- `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.
- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order.
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the loop.

Since the loop is `for i in range(n):`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be the next integer in the sequence.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. Then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_end`, the state at the start of the next iteration will have `i` as `i_end + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is `i`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`**

Since `i` was `i_end` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is `i`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i_end + 1`**

Since `i_end` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we can simply denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is `i`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`**

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is `i`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`**

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`, then `temp` is `i`, otherwise `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`**

Simplified, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is determined by the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `ans` is a list containing the value `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and the newly appended value `abs(a[i] - b[i])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `i + 1`**
