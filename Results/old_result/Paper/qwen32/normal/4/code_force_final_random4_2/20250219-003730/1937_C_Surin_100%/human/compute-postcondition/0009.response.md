The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream. This operation does not change the values of any variables in the program. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged after the code execution.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is `i`.**
