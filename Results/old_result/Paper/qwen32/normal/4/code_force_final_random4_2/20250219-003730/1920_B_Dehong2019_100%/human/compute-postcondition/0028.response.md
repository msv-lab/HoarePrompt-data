Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[x + 1] - a[2x + 1] * 2`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains `ans1 + a[x + 1]`.**
