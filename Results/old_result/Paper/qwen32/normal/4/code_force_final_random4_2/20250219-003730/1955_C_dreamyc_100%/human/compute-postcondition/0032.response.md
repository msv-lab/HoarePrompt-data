Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `k` (an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15), and `nums` (a list of integers of length n where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The function returns `n` if a specific condition is met, otherwise, it returns `ans`, which represents the total number of iterations where either `s_a <= a` or `s_b <= b`.**
