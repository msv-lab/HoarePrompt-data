The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but since the code reads a new input and assigns it to `T`, the value of `t` is no longer relevant to the state after the code execution.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
