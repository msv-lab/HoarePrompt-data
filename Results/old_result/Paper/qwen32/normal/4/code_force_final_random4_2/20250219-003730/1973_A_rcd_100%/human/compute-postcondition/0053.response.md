The value of `x` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 1, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the integers read from the input, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `p3` must be at least 1; `x` is increased by 1.
