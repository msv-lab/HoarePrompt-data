Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, the variable `d[p]` is incremented by the value of `d[x]`. Since `p` is 1 and `x` is also 1, `d[p]` is effectively `d[1]`, which is initially 1. Therefore, `d[1]` will be updated to `d[1] + d[1]`, resulting in `d[1]` being 2.

The other variables and their states remain unchanged. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is `{1: 2}`, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in the `visited` set. Additionally, `x` is equal to 1, and `d[x]` is less than `A`.**
