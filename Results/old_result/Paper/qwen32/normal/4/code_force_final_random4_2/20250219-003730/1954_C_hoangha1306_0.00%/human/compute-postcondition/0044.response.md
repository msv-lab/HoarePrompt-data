The code snippet `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the string `kq1`. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not directly modified by this code, except for `i` which was incremented in the initial state.

Since `i` is incremented before the code snippet, `a[i]` refers to the character in string `a` at the new value of `i`. The string `kq1` will now include this new character appended to its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `kq1` is `kq1` + `a[i]`**.
