`n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers provided as input, separated by a space. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` is not adjusted before the loop starts. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is not adjusted before the loop starts, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer.**
