The code snippet provided assigns the values returned by `func_1().split()` to the variables `r` and `c`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Given that `func_1().split()` returns two values, `r` and `c` will each hold one of these values. However, the specific values of `r` and `c` cannot be determined from the given information.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing `x`, `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1().split()`**.
