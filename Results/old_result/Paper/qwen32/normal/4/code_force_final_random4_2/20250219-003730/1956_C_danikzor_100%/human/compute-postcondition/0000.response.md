Output State: **Each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the n×n matrix filled with zeroes. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the input. The value of `n` is now known and is an input integer, representing the size of an n×n matrix filled with zeroes. The other conditions about the number of test cases `t` and the sum of n^2 remain unchanged.
