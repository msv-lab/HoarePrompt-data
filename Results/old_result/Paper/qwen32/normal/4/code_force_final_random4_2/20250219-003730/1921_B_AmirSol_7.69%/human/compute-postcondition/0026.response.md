Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `i` is less than `n` and `i` has been incremented by 1; `counter` is increased by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `i` has increased by 1, and `counter` has also increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
