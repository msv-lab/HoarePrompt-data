Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 7, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression evaluates to `(1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6`. Therefore, `res` becomes `1 + 6 = 7`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mat`, and `i` remain unchanged.
