Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 6 elements, `i` is either 4 or 5 or 6.**

Natural Language: The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so if `i` was 3, it is now 4; if `i` was 4, it is now 5; and if `i` was 5, it is now 6. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged.
