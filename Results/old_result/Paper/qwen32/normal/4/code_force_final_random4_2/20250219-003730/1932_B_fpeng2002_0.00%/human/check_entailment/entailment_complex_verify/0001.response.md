### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the program and the annotations to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Understanding:
The objective is to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign and the requirement that signs must occur sequentially.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows these steps for each test case:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0, representing the year before the first sign can occur.
4. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by:
   - Adding 1 to `start_year` to ensure we are starting from the year after the previous sign occurred.
   - Dividing by the periodicity `nums[x]` and adding 1 to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` to get the actual year of the next occurrence.
5. It prints the final `start_year` after processing all signs.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`
   - `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - Third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - Sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (matches the expected result)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`
   - `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2` (incorrect, should be 1)
     - The program logic is flawed here. It should be `start_year = ((start_year) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` rather than `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` to correctly find the next occurrence.

However, let's re-examine the logic for the second test case:
- `start_year = 0`
- First sign: `start_year = ((0) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1` (correct)
- Second sign: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4` (incorrect, should be 2)
- The logic provided in the program is indeed incorrect for this test case.

Let's verify the third and fourth test cases as well:
3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`
   - `nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2` (incorrect, should be 1)
     - Second sign: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3` (incorrect, should be 2)
     - The logic provided in the program is indeed incorrect for this test case.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`
   - `nums = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
   - Calculation:
     - `start_year = 0`
     - First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
     - Second sign: `start_year = ((50 + 1) // 30 + 1) * 30 = 80`
     - Third sign: `start_year = ((80 + 1) // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = ((711 + 1) // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = ((900 + 1) // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
     - Sixth sign: `start_year = ((1006 + 1) // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (matches the expected result)

Given the above analysis, the program logic is incorrect for the second and third test cases due to the flawed formula for determining the next occurrence year.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the year of the n-th sign's occurrence due to an incorrect formula for determining the next occurrence year.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
