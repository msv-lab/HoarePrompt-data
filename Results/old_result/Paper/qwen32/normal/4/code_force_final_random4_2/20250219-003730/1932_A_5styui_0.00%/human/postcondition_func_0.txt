The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `path` of length `n`. The string `path` consists of characters '.', '@', or '*', with the first character guaranteed to be '.'. The function counts the number of '@' characters in the string `path` for each test case and prints this count. After processing each test case, the count is reset to zero.
