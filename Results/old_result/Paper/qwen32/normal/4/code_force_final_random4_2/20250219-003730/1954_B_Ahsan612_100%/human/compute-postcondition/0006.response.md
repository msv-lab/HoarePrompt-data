The code snippet provided is `i = 1`. This line of code assigns the value `1` to the variable `i`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `minn`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, `i` is 1.**
