The loop condition for the `while` loop is `r - l > 1`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the difference between `r` and `l` must be greater than 1. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `l` and `r` are updated based on the comparison of `array[mid]` and `find`. However, the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided directly. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `l` and `r` such that their difference is greater than 1.

Let's analyze the possible states:
- If `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` is updated to `mid` and `r` remains `n`.
- If `array[mid]` is greater than `find`, `l` remains 0 and `r` is updated to `mid`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `r - l > 1`. This means if `l` is updated to `mid`, `mid` should be less than `n-1` (so that `r - l` remains greater than 1). Similarly, if `r` is updated to `mid`, `mid` should be greater than 1 (so that `r - l` remains greater than 1).

Since we don't have the exact values of `l`, `r`, and `mid`, we can ensure the loop can execute again by setting `r` to a value greater than `l + 1`. 

A safe adjustment would be to set `r` to `l + 2` if `l` is not already `n-1`. This ensures that the difference `r - l` is at least 2, satisfying the loop condition.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`; `find` is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n); `r` must be at least `l + 2`**
