The given code snippet assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + i]`. This means that the element at index `left + i` in the list `cliquess` is updated to the value of `clique`. 

Other variables such as `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` remain unchanged. The expression `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is also not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`left` and `right` are integers such that \(0 \leq \text{left} < \text{right} < n\), `clique` is an integer representing the current clique number, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is \((\text{right} - \text{left} + 1) // 2\), `not_mid` is \(\text{right} - \text{left} + 1 - \text{mid}\), and `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is `small_element + i`. `cliquess[left + i]` is `clique`.**
