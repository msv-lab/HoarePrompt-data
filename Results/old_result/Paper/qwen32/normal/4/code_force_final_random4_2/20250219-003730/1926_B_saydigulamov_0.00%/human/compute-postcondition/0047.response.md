The value of `b` is reassigned to the new user input. The values of `a`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged. If the new `b` contains the character '1', `k` will be updated to contain the count of '1' in the new `b`. Otherwise, `k` will remain an empty list.

Output State: **`a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, `i` is 3, `b` is the new user's input, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b` if `b` contains '1', otherwise `k` is an empty list. The input value for the next iteration must be greater than 2.**
