Postcondition: **The input provides an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input. If `k` is 1, then `k` remains 1. If `k` is not 1 and `k` is less than or equal to 2 times `n`, `k` retains its original value. If `k` is greater than 2 times `n`, then `k` retains its original value.**
