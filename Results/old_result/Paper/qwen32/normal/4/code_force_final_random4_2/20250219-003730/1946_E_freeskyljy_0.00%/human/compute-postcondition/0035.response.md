The code snippet provided is:
```
nums_left -= 1
```

This line of code decrements the value of the variable `nums_left` by 1. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `N` must be greater than 4.
- `M1` and `M2` are integers obtained from the input.
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`.
- The first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`.
- At least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `cur` is `M1 - 5` if `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 4`.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`.
- `i` is `N - 3`.
- `ans` is initially the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` and is further updated based on conditions.

The only change made by the code snippet provided is the decrement of `nums_left` by 1. Therefore, the updated value of `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 4, `M1` and `M2` are integers obtained from the input, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input, the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, the first element of `L` is 1, and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, at least one of the following is true: `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the last second element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`, `M1` is greater than 1, `cur` is `M1 - 5` if `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, otherwise `cur` is `M1 - 4`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 5`, `i` is `N - 3`, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of `N - 1` choose `L[-1] - 1` and is further updated based on conditions.**
