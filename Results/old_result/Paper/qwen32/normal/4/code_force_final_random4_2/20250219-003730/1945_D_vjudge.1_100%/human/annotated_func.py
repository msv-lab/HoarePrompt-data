#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. a and b are lists of integers, each of length n, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9.

    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value of a[i] + suff[i + 1] for all i from 0 to k-1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n` and `k` (integers where 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000) and two lists `a` and `b` (each of length `n` with integers in the range 1 to 10^9). It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` from 0 to `k-1`, where `suff[i]` is the sum of the minimum values of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` from index `i` to `n-1`.
