Output State: **`num_tests` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `(((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x])`, `x` is `k + 2`. The value of `start_year` has been recalculated using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.**

In simple terms, the value of `start_year` has been updated by applying the given formula to its previous value, while all other variables remain unchanged.
