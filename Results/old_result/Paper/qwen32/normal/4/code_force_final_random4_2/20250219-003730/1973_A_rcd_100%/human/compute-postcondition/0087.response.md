To determine the output of the `print(p1 - x + p3)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Given Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the initial state).
2. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
4. The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
5. `p3` is non-negative.
6. `x` is either 1 or 2.
7. `y` must be at least `x` (though `y` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the initial state).

### Variables in the Print Statement:
- `p1`: This is one of the integers read from the input.
- `x`: This is either 1 or 2.
- `p3`: This is another integer read from the input and is non-negative.

### Calculation:
The expression `p1 - x + p3` involves subtracting `x` (which is either 1 or 2) from `p1` and then adding `p3`.

### Output:
To provide a precise description, let's break down the expression:
- `p1` is an integer read from the input.
- `x` is either 1 or 2.
- `p3` is a non-negative integer read from the input.

Thus, the output will be the result of the expression `p1 - x + p3`.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `x`, and `p3` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **p1 - x + p3 (where p1 is an integer read from the input, x is either 1 or 2, and p3 is a non-negative integer read from the input)**
