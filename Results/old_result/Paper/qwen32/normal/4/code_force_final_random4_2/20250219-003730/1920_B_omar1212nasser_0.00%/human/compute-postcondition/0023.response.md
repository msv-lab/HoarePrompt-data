The `IndexError` might occur at the line `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]` if the index `-(negatives + i)` or `-i` is out of bounds for the list `elements`.

If no `IndexError` occurs, the program successfully executes the line `n += elements[-(negatives + i)] - elements[-i]`, updating the value of `n` accordingly. Given the initial state and the provided output state after the `try` block, `n` would be updated to `n + elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]`.

If an `IndexError` does occur, `n` is set to 0.

Therefore, the final output state of the program after the complete execution of the `try` statement is:

Output State: **`removals` is 2, `s` is `s - elements[-2] - elements[-2] - elements[-3]`, `n` is `n + elements[-(negatives + 3)] - elements[-3]` if no `IndexError` occurs, otherwise `n` is 0, `pos` has elements `[s - 2 * n, s - 2 * n]`, `i` is 3.**
