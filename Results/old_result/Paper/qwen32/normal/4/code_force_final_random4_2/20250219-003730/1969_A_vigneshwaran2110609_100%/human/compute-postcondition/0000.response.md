The code snippet provided is:

```python
n = int(input())
```

This line of code reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The precondition specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50 for each test case. Therefore, after executing this line, the value of `n` will be updated to the integer input provided by the user, and it will still satisfy the condition 2 <= n <= 50.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer input by the user such that 2 <= n <= 50; `p` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i for all i in [1, n].**
