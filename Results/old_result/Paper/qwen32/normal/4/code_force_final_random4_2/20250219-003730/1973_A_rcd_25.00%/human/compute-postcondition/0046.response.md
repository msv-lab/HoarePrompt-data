The only variable in the loop head is `cur`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur` and `high`. If `high >= cur`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur` will have been adjusted based on the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `cur` is less than or equal to `high`.

Given the conditions:
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`
- `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `cur` should be set to a value that is less than or equal to `high`. Since `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we need to ensure that `low + 1` is less than or equal to `high`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `cur` to be `low` if it is not already, ensuring that `cur` can be incremented to `low + 1` if necessary, and that `low + 1` is still less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd; `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`; `cur` is `low`**
