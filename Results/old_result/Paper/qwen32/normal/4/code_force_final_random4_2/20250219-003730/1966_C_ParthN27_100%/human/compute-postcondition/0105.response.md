The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range it iterates over, which is defined by `1` to `n-1`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range `(1, n-1)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at the value that caused the loop to end. Since the loop iterates from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive), the next value of `i` should be the current value of `i` plus one, provided it is still within the range `(1, n-1)`.

Given that the number of iterations left is `t-1`, this does not directly affect the loop variable `i` but indicates how many more times the loop can execute before the outer context decides to stop.

Since the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the last iteration.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration as `i_end`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i_end`, we can express the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is the newly read list of integers, `s` is a list containing `0` followed by all unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, the number of iterations left is `t-1`, `i` is `i_end + 1` where `i_end` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, and `i_end + 1` must be less than `n-1`.**
