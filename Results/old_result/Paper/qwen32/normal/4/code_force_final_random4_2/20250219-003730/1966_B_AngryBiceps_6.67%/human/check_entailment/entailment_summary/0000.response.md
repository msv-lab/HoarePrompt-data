### Reasoning:

The task is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. The operations allow you to select any two squares of the same color and color the entire subrectangle between them with that color.

The provided program checks two conditions:
1. If all characters in the first row are the same and the first row is different from the last row.
2. If all characters in the first column are the same and the first column is different from the last column.

If either of these conditions is true, the program outputs "NO", indicating that it's not possible to make the entire grid the same color. Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

Let's analyze why these conditions are sufficient to determine the answer:

- If all characters in the first row are the same and different from the last row, it means there's a 'stripe' of one color at the top and another color at the bottom. Since the operation allows us to color only subrectangles of the same color, we cannot change the color of the entire grid without affecting the other colors in the middle, which prevents us from making the entire grid one color.
  
- Similarly, if all characters in the first column are the same and different from the last column, it means there's a 'stripe' of one color at the left and another color at the right. Again, this prevents us from making the entire grid one color using the allowed operations.

However, if neither of these conditions is true, it means there is no such 'stripe' of different colors along the edges that would prevent us from making the entire grid the same color. In this case, it's always possible to make the entire grid the same color, regardless of the initial configuration, by carefully choosing the operations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given conditions. Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
