Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing scores of three players sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers read from the input.
- The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
- If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program executes the if part.
- Otherwise, the loop will print either `p1 - x + p3` where `p1 - x <= p2 - y` or `p3` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(-1)
```

### Explanation:
The code snippet simply contains a `print(-1)` statement. This statement will output the integer `-1` regardless of the conditions or values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

### Output:
Output: **-1**
