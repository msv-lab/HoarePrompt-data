### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, where \( \oplus \) is the bitwise XOR operation.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - You can ask up to \( 3n \) queries.
   - Each query involves four indices \( a, b, c, d \) and returns the comparison result between \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \), where \( \mid \) is the bitwise OR operation.

#### Solution Approach:
1. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The first loop in `func_2` aims to find the index of the maximum element in the permutation. It does this by comparing each element with the current maximum using the bitwise OR operation.
   - The query `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` is used to compare \( p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \) with \( p_i \). If the result is `<`, it means \( p_i \) is greater, and `max_item_idx` is updated to `i`.
   
2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
   - The second loop in `func_2` aims to find the pair \( (i, j) \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - The query `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` is used to compare \( (p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair\_idx}}) \) with \( (p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_i) \).
   - If the result is `<`, it means \( p_i \) could potentially form a larger XOR with \( p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \), so `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it means \( p_i \) has the same OR value with \( p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \) as \( p_{\text{pair\_idx}} \). To resolve ties, a secondary comparison is made using `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`. If the result is `>`, it means \( p_i \) is greater than \( p_{\text{pair\_idx}} \), so `pair_idx` is updated to `i`.

#### Analysis:
- The approach effectively finds the maximum element in the permutation and then finds the element that, when XORed with the maximum element, produces the largest result.
- The bitwise OR operation is used to compare elements, which is a valid strategy because a larger OR value indicates a larger element in the permutation.
- The number of queries is \( 2n \) (one loop for finding the maximum element and one loop for finding the pair), which is well within the limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the strategy to find the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value using the allowed number of queries and operations.

#### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
