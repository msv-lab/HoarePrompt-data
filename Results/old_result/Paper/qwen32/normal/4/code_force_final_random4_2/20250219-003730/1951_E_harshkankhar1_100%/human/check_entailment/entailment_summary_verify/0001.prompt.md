You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    s = input()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads a string `s` from the input, checks certain conditions based on the characters in the string and the result of an external function `func_1`, and prints specific messages and substrings of `s` based on these conditions. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Input:** Multiple test cases, each with a string `s`.
2. **Output:** For each test case, determine if the string can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes.
3. If possible, output "YES" followed by the number of partitions and the partitions themselves.
4. If not possible, output "NO".

### Analysis of the Provided Program:

#### Function `func_1(s) -> bool`:
- **Purpose:** Checks if the string `s` is a palindrome.
- **Implementation:** Returns `True` if `s` is equal to its reverse (`s[::-1]`), otherwise `False`.
- **Correctness:** This function correctly identifies whether a string is a palindrome.

#### Function `func_2()`:
- **Purpose:** Handles the input and output for each test case.
- **Steps:**
  1. **Read Input:** Reads the string `s`.
  2. **Check if the Whole String is Non-Palindrome:**
     - If `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s[0:]) == False`), it outputs "YES", the number of partitions as `1`, and the string `s` itself as the partition.
  3. **Find the First Non-Matching Character:**
     - It searches for the first character `s[i]` that is different from `s[0]` and stores its index in `x`.
     - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it means all characters in `s` are the same, and thus any substring will be a palindrome. It outputs "NO".
  4. **Check Substring After the First Non-Matching Character:**
     - If the substring from `x+1` to the end is not a palindrome, it outputs "YES", the number of partitions as `2`, and the partitions as `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.
     - If the substring from `x+1` to the end is a palindrome and `x` is `1` or `n//2`, it outputs "NO".
     - Otherwise, it outputs "YES", the number of partitions as `2`, and the partitions as `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

### Issues in the Provided Program:
1. **Handling of Palindrome Substrings:**
   - The program assumes that if the substring from `x+1` to the end is a palindrome, and `x` is `1` or `n//2`, there is no valid partition. This is not necessarily true. For example, if `s = "aaaaab"`, `x` would be `4`, and the substring `"b"` is not a palindrome, so a valid partition would be `["aaaaa", "b"]`.
   
2. **Partition Logic:**
   - The logic for partitioning the string when `x` is not `1` or `n//2` is flawed. It should attempt to find a valid partition by checking multiple possible splits, not just `x+2`.
   
3. **General Approach:**
   - The program does not attempt to find a valid partition if the initial checks fail. It should iteratively try to split the string into non-palindrome substrings.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings but the initial checks fail.
