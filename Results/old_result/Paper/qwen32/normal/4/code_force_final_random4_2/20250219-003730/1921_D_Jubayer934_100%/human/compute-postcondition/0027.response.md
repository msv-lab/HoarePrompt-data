Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer obtained from the input; `temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n; `ans` is a list containing the values `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for all `i` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and now includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is `temp + 1`**

In this state, the `ans` list has been updated to include the new value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`. All other variables retain their previous values.
