The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1` and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is already `i + 1` from the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 2`.

State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `g` is 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `v2` is `i + 2`, `r` is an input string. If `r` equals `<`, then `v1` is `i + 2`.**
