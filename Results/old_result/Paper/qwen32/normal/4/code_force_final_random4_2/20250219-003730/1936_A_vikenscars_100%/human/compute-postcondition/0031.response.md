The code snippet assigns the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` to the variable `ans2`. The values of `max_item_idx`, `n`, `i`, and `ans1` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new value of `ans2` while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`max_item_idx` is the largest `i` (from 1 to `n-1`) for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<', `n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans1` is the result of `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)`, `ans2` is the result of `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)`**
