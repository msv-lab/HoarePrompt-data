The code snippet initializes a stack with a single tuple `(1, 1)`. This means that the stack now contains one element, which is the tuple `(1, 1)`. The values of `A`, `g`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`A` is a positive integer, `g` is an adjacency list representing the tree where each key is a vertex and its value is a list of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that 0 <= k < n where n is the number of vertices in the tree, `stack` is `[(1, 1)]`**.
