To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i` and the length of `ar`.

The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Since `ar` has at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` is at least 2. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(ar)` to satisfy the condition.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `i` is 2 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num` and 3 otherwise
- If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 2; otherwise, `same` is 1
- `num` is updated to `ar[2]` while `minn` is set to 1

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `ar` has at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` is at least 2. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Since `i` is either 2 or 3, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be 2 (because if `i` is 3, the loop will not execute again since `len(ar)` is at least 2).

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to set `i` to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `same` is 2 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 1 otherwise, `num` is `ar[2]` if `ar[i]` was equal to `num`, `minn` is 1**
