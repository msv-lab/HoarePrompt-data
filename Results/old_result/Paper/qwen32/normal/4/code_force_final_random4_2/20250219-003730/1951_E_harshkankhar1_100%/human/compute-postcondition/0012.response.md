Postcondition: **`s` is the input string, `n` is the length of the input string and is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is `i` if the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the first character of `s`, otherwise `x` remains -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the first character of `s`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
