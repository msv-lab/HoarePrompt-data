Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `b` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order.**

In simple terms: The value of `t` remains greater than 0, `n` and `m` retain their input values, `a` remains unchanged, and `b` is now sorted in ascending order.
