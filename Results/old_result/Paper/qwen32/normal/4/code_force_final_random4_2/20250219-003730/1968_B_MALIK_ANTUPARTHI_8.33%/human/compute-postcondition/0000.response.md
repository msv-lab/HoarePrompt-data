The code snippet `a = int(input())` changes the variable `a` to an integer value that is input by the user. The initial state specifies that `a` is a binary string of length `n`. After the execution of the code, `a` is no longer a binary string but an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is an input integer; `b` is a binary string of length `m`.**
