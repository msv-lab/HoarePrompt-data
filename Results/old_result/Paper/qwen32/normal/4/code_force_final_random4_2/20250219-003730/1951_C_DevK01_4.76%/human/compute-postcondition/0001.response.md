In the provided task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `_` which is a throwaway variable, and `t` which determines the number of iterations the loop will execute. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are mentioned to remain unchanged and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the execution of the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, the variable `t` must be greater than 0. The value of `t` dictates how many times the loop will run. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute at all.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.**
