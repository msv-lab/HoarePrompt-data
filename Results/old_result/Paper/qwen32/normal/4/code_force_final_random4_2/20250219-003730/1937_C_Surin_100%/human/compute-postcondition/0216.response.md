Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a permutation `p` of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function can perform up to 3n queries to compare bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in `p`. It returns a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p[i]` and `p[j]` is maximized.**
