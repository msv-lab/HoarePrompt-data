The code snippet provided updates the value of `zeroInd` based on the last element of the `suffZero` list. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly influenced by this operation.

Given:
- `suffZero` is a list containing accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<'.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * suffZero[-1]`.

Since `zeroInd` is being directly updated, we need to reflect this change in the output state. The other variables (`s1`, `pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `ans`, `n`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `oneInd`, `fi`, `i`) are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `pre` is a list of integers representing the positions (1-based index) of all '>' characters in `s1`; `totalOne` is updated based on the value of `el` where it is reduced by 1 if `el` is '>'; `preOne` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the elements in `pre`, starting with an initial value of 0, and the last element is removed if `el` is '>'; `suffZero` is a list containing elements that are accumulated sums of positions of '<' characters, starting with a single element `0` and updated by adding `i + 1` if `el` is '<'; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros except `ans[i]` which is updated based on the conditions provided; `n` must be greater than 0; `el` is `s1[i]` which is either '<' or '>'; `ol` is `totalOne`; `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`; `oneInd` and `fi` are calculated based on the values of `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`; `i` is `k - 2`.**
