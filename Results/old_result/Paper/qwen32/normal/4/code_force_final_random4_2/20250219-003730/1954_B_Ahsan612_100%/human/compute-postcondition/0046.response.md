The variable `i` is reassigned the value `1`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is `1`, `same` is `1`, `num` is the first element of `ar`, `minn` is infinity.
