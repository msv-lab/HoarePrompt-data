The code snippet `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. Given the initial state, `ans` is either `0` (if `i` is in `hmp`) or `2 * m` (if `i` is not in `hmp`). After the increment, `ans` becomes `m` (if `i` is in `hmp`) or `3 * m` (if `i` is not in `hmp`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decremented by 1, `k * m + sum(m - hmp[i] for i in hmp if hmp[i] < m)` remains unchanged, `s` is an input string, `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, `hmp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of characters in `s`, `i` is `'B'`, `ans` is `m` if `'B'` is in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` is `3 * m`.**
