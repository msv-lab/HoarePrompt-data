The only variable in the loop head is `q` from `ans`. Therefore, we need to adjust `q` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `q` iterates over the elements in `ans`, at the start of the next iteration, `q` should be the next element in `ans`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` contains at least one element, and `q` has just taken on the value of the last element it processed. For the loop to execute again, `ans` must have more elements, and `q` should be set to the next element in `ans`.

State: **`n` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration, `m` is one less than the value at the end of the previous iteration and still greater than 0, `x` is unchanged, `ans` contains at least two elements, `r` is the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[0]` (now as an integer), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()[1]` (now as a string). If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set. `q` is the next element in `ans`**
