The code appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Therefore, the list `path_ba`, which initially contains a single element `b`, now contains two elements: `b` and `n`.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `n`; `n` is `previous[b]`. If `n` is -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.**
