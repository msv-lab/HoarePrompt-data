Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the newly stripped input string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is the length of the newly stripped input string, `work` is False, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, and `counter` is the final value after all iterations.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is reset to an empty string, while all other variables retain their previous values.
