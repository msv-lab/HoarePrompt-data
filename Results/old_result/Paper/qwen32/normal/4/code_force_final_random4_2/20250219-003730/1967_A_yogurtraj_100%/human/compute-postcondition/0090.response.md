The code snippet sorts the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `rem`, `y`, `ii`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the first integer provided by the current input; `a` is the sorted list of integers provided by the current input; `rem` is 0; `y` is 0; `ii` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration; `k` is the second integer provided by the current input.**
