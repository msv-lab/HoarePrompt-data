To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which the `dp` list is computed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t` is truthy**: This indicates that `t` is a value that evaluates to `True` in a boolean context.
2. **`n` is the first integer from the input**: This means `n` is an integer value that is provided as the first input to the program.
3. **`k` is greater than 0**: `k` is a positive integer.
4. **`dp` is a list of `m + 1` values computed using the loop formula**: `dp` is a list where each element is computed using a specific loop formula, and it contains `m + 1` elements.
5. **`i` is `m + 1`**: `i` is set to the value `m + 1`.

### Analysis:
The `dp` list is computed using a loop formula, but the exact formula is not provided in the initial state. However, we know that `dp` has `m + 1` elements, and we are interested in the value of `dp[m]`.

### Output Determination:
Since `dp` is a list of `m + 1` values, `dp[m]` refers to the last element of the `dp` list. The exact value of `dp[m]` depends on the loop formula used to populate the `dp` list, which is not provided.

However, based on the information given, we can say that `dp[m]` is the last element of the `dp` list, computed using the loop formula.

### Final Output:
Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the last element of the dp list computed using the loop formula)**
