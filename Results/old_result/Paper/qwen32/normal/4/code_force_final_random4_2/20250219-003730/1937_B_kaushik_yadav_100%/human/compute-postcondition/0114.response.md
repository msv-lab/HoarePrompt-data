Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is the newly stripped input string, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2` or the loop breaks early, `counter` is the final value after all iterations, `ans` is the previous `ans` concatenated with `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
