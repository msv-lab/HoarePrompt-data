The provided code snippet is `sys.stdout.flush()`, which is used to flush the output buffer. This operation does not change the values of any variables or the state of the program in terms of variable values. Therefore, the values of `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, `i`, and `prev` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is the largest `i` for which `r` was `'<'` during the iterations, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0**.
