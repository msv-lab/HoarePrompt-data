The code snippet `inds[0].append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the list that is the value of the key `0` in the `inds` defaultdict. Since `inds` is a defaultdict of lists, if the key `0` does not exist, it will be created with an empty list as its value, and then `0` will be appended to this list.

Therefore, after the execution of the code, the list associated with the key `0` in the `inds` defaultdict will contain the single element `0`.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are the values returned by `func_1(int)`, `a` is the list returned by `func_1(int)`, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing the single element 0, `inds` is a defaultdict of lists where `inds[0]` is `[0]`.**
