The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means the initial state's description of `t` being `t - 1` is not affected by this code snippet, and `t` remains as `t - 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers as read from the input.**
