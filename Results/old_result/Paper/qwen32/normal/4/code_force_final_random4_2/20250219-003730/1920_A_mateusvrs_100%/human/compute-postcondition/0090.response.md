The code snippet `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Given the initial state, where `tmp` is either 0 or 1, after this operation, `tmp` will be 1 or 2 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the initial state of the program variables minus 1, `r` is a list with `n` additional elements appended to it, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value, `ax` is the minimum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of `x` encountered when `a` was 1, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, and `tmp` is 1 or 2, `i` is a new value from `cx` that hasn't been iterated over yet.**
