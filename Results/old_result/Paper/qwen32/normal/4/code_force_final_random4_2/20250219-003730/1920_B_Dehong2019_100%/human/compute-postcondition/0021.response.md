The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is initialized to `x` and `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, the value of `ans1` will increase by `a[x]`.

Since `a` is sorted in descending order, `a[x]` is the (x+1)-th largest element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is `x`, `ans2` is `max(ans1, ans2)`, `ans1` is `ans1 + a[x]`**.
