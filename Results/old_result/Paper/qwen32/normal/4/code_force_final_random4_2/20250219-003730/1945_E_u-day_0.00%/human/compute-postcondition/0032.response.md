The given code snippet adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Since `mid` is already in `st` according to the initial state, adding it again will not change the set because sets do not allow duplicate elements. Therefore, the values of `n`, `low`, `high`, and `mid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `st` contains `mid`.**
