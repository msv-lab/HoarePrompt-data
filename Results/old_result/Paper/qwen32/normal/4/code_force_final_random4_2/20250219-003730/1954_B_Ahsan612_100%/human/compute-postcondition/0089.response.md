The code snippet `same += 1` increments the value of the variable `same` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `same` was 1, so after the execution, `same` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers read from input with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `minn` is `inf`, and `_` is `k + 1`. The current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**
