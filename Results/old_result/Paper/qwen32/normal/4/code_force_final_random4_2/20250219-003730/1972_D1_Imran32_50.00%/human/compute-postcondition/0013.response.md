To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the computation involved in the variable `ans`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **ans** is initialized to the value of `n`.
2. **ans** is then incremented by the result of the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from `2` to `root`.

### Step-by-Step Computation:
1. **Initial Value of `ans`**: 
   - `ans` is initially set to `n`.

2. **Incrementing `ans`**:
   - For each integer `i` ranging from `2` to `root` (inclusive), the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` is computed and added to `ans`.
   - This means for each `i`, the value `floor((n + i) / (i * i))` is calculated and added to `ans`.

### Final Value of `ans`:
- The final value of `ans` is the sum of its initial value `n` and the sum of the computed values for each `i` from `2` to `root`.

### Output Description:
- Since the exact values of `n` and `root` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
- However, we can describe the value of `ans` precisely based on the given information.

### Final Answer:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the final value of `ans`, which is the initial value `n` plus the sum of the computed values `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from `2` to `root`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the initial value n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for each i from 2 to root)**
