Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first input integer, `f` is the second input integer minus 1, `k` is the third input integer minus 1, `a` is a new list of integers from the input sorted in descending order, and `x` is the element at the original index `f` from the unsorted list `a`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, the condition is met but no specific action is described in the if part. Otherwise, no action is specified in the else part either.**
