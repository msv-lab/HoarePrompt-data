The provided program aims to solve the problem by sorting the array `a` in ascending order and the array `b` in descending order. It then calculates the maximum difference `D` by strategically pairing elements from `a` and `b` to maximize the absolute differences.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Sorting `a` and `b`:** 
   - `a` is sorted in ascending order, and `b` is sorted in descending order. This is done to maximize the absolute difference between elements of `a` and `b` when pairing them.

2. **Pairing Strategy:**
   - The program iterates through the elements of `a` and `b` to find the optimal pairing that maximizes the total difference `D`.
   - It checks if pairing the current element of `a` with the smallest remaining element of `b` (which is `b[-(n - i)]` in the reversed list) gives a larger difference than pairing it with the next largest element of `b` (which is `b[i]` in the reversed list).
   - If a larger difference is found, it switches to the strategy of pairing `a[i]` with `b[-(n - i)]` from that point onwards.

3. **Calculating the Difference:**
   - The program calculates the absolute difference for each pair and accumulates these differences to get the total difference `D`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements of `a` and `b` for a test case, the program prints the total difference `D`.

The program's logic aligns with the problem's requirement to maximize the total difference `D`. It strategically pairs elements from `a` and `b` to achieve this goal.

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided example:

**Example:**

**Input:**
```

3 5 1 7 2 3
3 4
1 1 1
1 1 1 1
5 5
1 2 3 4 5

```

**Output:**
```
16
0
