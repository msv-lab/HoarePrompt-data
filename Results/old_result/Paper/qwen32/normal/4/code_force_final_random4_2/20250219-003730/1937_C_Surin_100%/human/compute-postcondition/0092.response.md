To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n` and `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `kp` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `v2` is `n-1`

Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, the loop will terminate after `i` reaches `n-1`. Therefore, to execute one more iteration, `i` must be adjusted to the next value in the range, which is not possible since `i` is already `n-1`.

However, if we consider the state right before the last iteration (where `i` would be `n-2`), the state would be:
- `kp` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-2` (adjusted for the next iteration)
- `v2` is `n-1`

So, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the last iteration) would be:
State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-2`, `v2` is `n-1`**

But since `i` is already `n-1` and the loop will terminate, the correct interpretation for the next iteration (which doesn't exist) would be to reflect the state right before the loop terminates:
State: **`kp` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`**

Since the loop will not execute again after `i` is `n-1`, the state does not change further for another iteration.
