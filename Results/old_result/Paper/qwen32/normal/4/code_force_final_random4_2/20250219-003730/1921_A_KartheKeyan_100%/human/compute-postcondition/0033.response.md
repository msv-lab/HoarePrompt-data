Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is 1; `coord` is a list containing four elements `[(original_x1, original_y1), (original_x2, original_y2), (original_x3, original_y3), (x, y)]` where `x` and `y` are the new values read from the input; `res` is 0; `i` is 3; `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[0]` and `coord[1]`; `p2` is the squared Euclidean distance between `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`.**

In simpler terms: After the loop has executed all four iterations, `coord` will contain four coordinate pairs, and `i` will be 3. The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial values. The variables `p1` and `p2` will hold the squared Euclidean distances between the specified pairs of coordinates.
