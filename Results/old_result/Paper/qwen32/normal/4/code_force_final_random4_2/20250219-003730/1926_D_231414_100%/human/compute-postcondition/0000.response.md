Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `times` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `times` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) are not affected by this code snippet.
