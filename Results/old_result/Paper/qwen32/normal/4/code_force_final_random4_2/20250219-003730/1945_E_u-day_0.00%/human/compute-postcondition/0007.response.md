The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`. The value of `arr` is determined by `func_2()`, and `pos` is set to `i` if `arr[i]` equals `k`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `1 <= k <= n`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is `i` if `arr[i]` equals `k`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `i` is `i + 1`**
