Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `minn` is 1, `same` is 3 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num` and 2 otherwise, and `i` is updated to 3 if `ar[i]` is equal to `num` and 4 otherwise.**

In simpler terms, the value of `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` was 2 and `ar[2]` was equal to `num`, then `same` is 3 and `i` becomes 3. If `i` was 2 and `ar[2]` was not equal to `num`, then `same` is 2, `num` is updated to `ar[3]`, and `i` becomes 3. If `i` was already greater than 2, `i` simply becomes `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
