The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several conditions and variable definitions, but these conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement itself. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the results of `func_1`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that differs from `s[0]` and is not equal to -1.
   - `func_1(s[0:])` returns `True`.
   - `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.
   - `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print('YES')` statement is executed regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the results of `func_1`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or the results of the functions, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
