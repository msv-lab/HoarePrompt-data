To determine what will be printed by the `print(dp[m])` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `t`, `n`, and `k` remain the same (though their specific values are not provided).
- `num` is the sum of 1s and 2s based on the comparisons of `c` and `r` over the `k` iterations (though its specific value is not provided).
- `m` is 8.
- `dp` is a list defined as `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`.
- `i` is 9 (though `i` is not used in the print statement).

The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the element at index `m` of the list `dp`. Given that `m` is 8, we need to find the element at index 8 in the list `dp`.

The list `dp` is provided: `[0, 1, 3, 7, 25, 81, 331, 1303, 5937]`.

The element at index 8 is `5937`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(dp[m])` statement is:

Output: **5937**
