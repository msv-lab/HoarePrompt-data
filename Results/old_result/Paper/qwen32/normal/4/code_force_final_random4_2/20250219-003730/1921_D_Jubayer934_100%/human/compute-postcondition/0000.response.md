The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` which is used to iterate over the range of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. Since `_` is just a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state explicitly. However, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value that will allow the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), the loop will execute `t` times. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
