Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`, which are integers representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order (0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30). It also accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). For each test case, it returns a result based on the scores of the players.**
