t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k where 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^9, and 1 <= k <= min(nm, 10^9). Additionally, each test case includes a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
