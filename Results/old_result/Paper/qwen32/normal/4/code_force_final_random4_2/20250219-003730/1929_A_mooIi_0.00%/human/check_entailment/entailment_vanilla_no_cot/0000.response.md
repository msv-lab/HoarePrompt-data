Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program is currently sorting the array and printing it, but it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. To find the maximum beauty, the program should sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i - 1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This version sorts the array, calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, and prints the result for each test case.
