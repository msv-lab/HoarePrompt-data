Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `m` is the second integer from the input; `temp` is 1 if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; otherwise, `temp` remains -1; `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`; `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input; `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `temp` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `temp` remains -1.**
