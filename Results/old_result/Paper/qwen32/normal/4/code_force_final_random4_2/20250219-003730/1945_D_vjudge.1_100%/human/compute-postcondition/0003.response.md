The code snippet updates the `suff` list at index `i` by adding the value of `suff[i + 1]` to `c[i]`. Given that `i` is initially `n - 1`, `suff[i + 1]` refers to `suff[n]`, which is initialized to 0. Therefore, `suff[n - 1]` will be set to `c[n - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 to 10^9; `c` is a list of integers, each of length `n`, where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1`, where `suff[n - 1]` is equal to `c[n - 1]` and all other elements are 0; `i` is `n - 1`.**
