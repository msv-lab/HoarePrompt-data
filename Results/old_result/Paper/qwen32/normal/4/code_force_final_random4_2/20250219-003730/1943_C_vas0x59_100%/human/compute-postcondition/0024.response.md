The code snippet assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `a` was previously assigned the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` will have the same value as `a`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains all the vertices directly connected to vertex `i` in the tree structure; `d` is a list where `d[i]` is the shortest distance from vertex `a` to vertex `i` in the tree; `previous` is a list that contains the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex `a` to each vertex in the tree; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.
