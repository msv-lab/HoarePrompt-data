Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is updated to include `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise `template` is updated to include the uppercase version of `a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
