Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`. If `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains unchanged.**
