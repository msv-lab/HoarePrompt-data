Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`; `match_a_b` retains its initial value; `i` is 1. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i] != template[i]`, then `match_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i] == template[i]`, then `match_c` retains its initial value. If `template[i]` is uppercase and `c[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is False.**
