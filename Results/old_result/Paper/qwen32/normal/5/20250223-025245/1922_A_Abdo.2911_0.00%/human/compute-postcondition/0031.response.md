Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `template` is a list of `n` characters where each character is the lowercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i] != b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False`; `template[i]` is an uppercase letter; either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) matches the lowercase version of `template[i]`**

In this output state, the value of `match_a_b` has been changed to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
