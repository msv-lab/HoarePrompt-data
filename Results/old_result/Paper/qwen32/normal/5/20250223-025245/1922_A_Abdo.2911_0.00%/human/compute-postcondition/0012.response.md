Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`.**
