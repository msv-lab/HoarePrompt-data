You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b

    adhoccoder

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it compares three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length `n`. It constructs a template string where characters from `a` and `b` are compared and matched or uppercased if they differ. The function then checks if the template matches `a` and `b` correctly and does not match `c`. If these conditions are met, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the creation of the template and matching logic for all cases. Specifically, the template creation logic is flawed because it only considers the characters from strings `a` and `b` without ensuring that the template can be constructed in a way that also allows `c` to not match.

Let's consider a specific case to illustrate the issue:

### Test Case:
```
1
2
aa
bb
ab
```

### Expected Output:
```
YES
```

### Explanation:
For this test case, a valid template could be `Ab`. Here, the first character of `a` and `b` are the same (`a`), so the template can be `a` or `A`. The second character of `a` and `b` are different (`a` and `b`), so the template can be `B` (uppercase). This template matches `a` (`aa`) and `b` (`bb`), but does not match `c` (`ab`).

### Program Output:
The program will output `NO` for this test case because the template it constructs will not satisfy the conditions properly.

### Why the Program Fails:
The program constructs the template by iterating through each character of `a` and `b`:
- If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the lowercase version of the character to the template.
- If the characters at position `i` in `a` and `b` are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template.

This logic does not guarantee that the constructed template will match `a` and `b` while not matching `c`. The program does not explore all possible valid templates that could satisfy the conditions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should try to construct a template that matches `a` and `b` while ensuring that `c` does not match. This involves checking all possible combinations of lowercase and uppercase characters for positions where `a` and `b` differ, and ensuring that `c` does not match the constructed template.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
