The code provided assigns a new value to the variable `c` by reading an input string and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace from it. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and the previous value of `c` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is the new input integer; `a` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
