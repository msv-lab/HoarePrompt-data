Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False if either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True. `match_c` is True. `_` is the current value of `_` plus `n` and `_` is less than `t`. `n` must be greater than 0. `a` is the stripped input string. `b` is the stripped input string. `c` is the stripped input string. `template` is a list that includes the character `a[i]` at the end if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise it includes the uppercase character `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`. `template[i]` is not a lowercase character.**
