The code snippet `n = int(input())` is executed, which means `n` is reassigned to the integer value provided by the input. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, but this value is overwritten by the new input. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is the new input integer; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
