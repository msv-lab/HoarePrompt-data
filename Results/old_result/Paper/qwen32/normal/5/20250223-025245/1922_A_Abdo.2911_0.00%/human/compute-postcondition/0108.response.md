Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is a positive integer input by the user; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings input by the user; `match_a_b` is True; `match_c` retains its initial value; `template` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, otherwise `a[i].upper()`.**

Explanation: The value of `match_a_b` has been updated to `True`. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
