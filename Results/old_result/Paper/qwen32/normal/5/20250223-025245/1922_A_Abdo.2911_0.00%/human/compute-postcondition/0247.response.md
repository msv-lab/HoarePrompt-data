The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement it is placed in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True` if the loop completes all `n` iterations without setting `match_a_b` to `False`; `match_c` is `False`; `_` is `current_value_of_ + n` and is less than `t`; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same; `template` remains the same; `i` is 5; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
