Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False and `match_c` is True.** 

Explanation: The if condition `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` means that for the code to enter the if statement, `match_a_b` must be True and `match_c` must be False. However, since the code enters the if statement, it contradicts the initial condition that `match_c` is True. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the if condition is if `match_a_b` is False, and `match_c` remains True as per the precondition. This ensures the if condition is not met, but since we are calculating the postcondition based on the if condition being true, we must account for the contradiction by stating `match_a_b` as False.
