Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, i is n, n is the newly input integer, a is the newly input string, b is the newly input string, c is the newly input string, and l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] for each of the t test cases; otherwise, l is 'NO' for that test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will reflect the result of each of the `t` test cases. For each test case, `l` will be 'YES' if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If no such position exists for a test case, `l` will be 'NO' for that test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be as per the input for each test case.
