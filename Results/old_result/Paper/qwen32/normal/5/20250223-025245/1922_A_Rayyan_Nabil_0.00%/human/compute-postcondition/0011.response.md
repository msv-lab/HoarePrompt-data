The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1. The value of `n` remains the same as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is set to `'YES'`.**
