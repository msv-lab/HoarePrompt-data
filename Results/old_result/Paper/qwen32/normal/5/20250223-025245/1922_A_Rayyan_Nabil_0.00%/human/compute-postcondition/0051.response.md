Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, i is n, n is the newly input integer, a is the newly input string, b is the newly input string, c is the newly input string, and l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO'.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` (the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`). The variable `l` will be 'YES' if there was at least one position in the strings where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]`. If no such position exists, `l` will be 'NO'. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
