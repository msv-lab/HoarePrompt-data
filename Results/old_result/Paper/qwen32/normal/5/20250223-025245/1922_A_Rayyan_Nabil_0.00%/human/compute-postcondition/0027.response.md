Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `n` + 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a newly input string, `b` is a newly input string, `c` is a newly input string, and `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If at the current index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` retains its original value.**
