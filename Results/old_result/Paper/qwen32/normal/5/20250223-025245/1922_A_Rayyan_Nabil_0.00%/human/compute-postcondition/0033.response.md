Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a newly input string, `b` is a newly input string, `c` is a newly input string, and `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, then `l` remains 'YES'. Otherwise, the value of `l` is not changed.**
