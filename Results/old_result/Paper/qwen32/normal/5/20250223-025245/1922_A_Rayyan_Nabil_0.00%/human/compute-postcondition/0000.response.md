The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input value represents the number of test cases. The other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.**
