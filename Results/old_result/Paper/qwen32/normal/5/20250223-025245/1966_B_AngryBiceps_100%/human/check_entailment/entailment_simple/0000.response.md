### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations. The provided program checks two specific conditions to determine if it's impossible to make all squares the same color:

1. If the first row is composed entirely of the same color and the last row is composed entirely of a different color.
2. If the first column is composed entirely of the same color and the last column is composed entirely of a different color.

If either of these conditions is met, the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine if it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color. Here's why:

- **Insufficient Conditions**: The program only checks the first and last rows and columns. It's possible for the rest of the grid to have a configuration that makes it impossible to achieve a uniform color, even if the first and last rows and columns are uniform and the same. For example, consider a grid where the first row is all 'W', the last row is all 'W', but there is a 'B' in the middle that cannot be changed using the allowed operations.

- **Correctness of Conditions**: The conditions checked by the program are necessary but not sufficient. If the first and last rows (or columns) are uniform and different, it's indeed impossible to make the entire grid uniform, but the converse is not true. There could be other configurations that prevent the entire grid from being uniform, which this program does not check.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not account for all possible configurations that could prevent the entire grid from being made uniform. It only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is not enough.

### Correctness: **False**
