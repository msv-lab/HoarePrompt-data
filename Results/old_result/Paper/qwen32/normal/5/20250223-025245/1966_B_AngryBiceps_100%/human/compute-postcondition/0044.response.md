Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the input values, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each of the `n` input values concatenated together, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each of the `n` input values concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations of the loop, `a` will contain all `n` input strings, `first_row` will be a string made up of the first characters of each input string, and `last_row` will be a string made up of the last characters of each input string. The variable `i` will be `n-1`, reflecting the final index of the loop.
