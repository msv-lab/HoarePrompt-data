Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the initial input provided by the user and the second element is the new input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input provided by the user, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input provided by the user, `i` is 1.**

In simple terms, the list `a` now has two elements: the first is the initial input provided by the user, and the second is the new input provided by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
