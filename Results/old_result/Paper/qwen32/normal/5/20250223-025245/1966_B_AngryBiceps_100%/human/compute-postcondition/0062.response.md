The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer from the new input
- `a` is a list containing `input_value`
- `first_row` is the first character of the last element of `a`
- `last_row` is an empty string
- `i` is 0

After executing the code:
- `last_row` is no longer an empty string; it now contains the last character of the last element of `a`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list containing `input_value`, `first_row` is the first character of the last element of `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element of `a`, `i` is 0**.
