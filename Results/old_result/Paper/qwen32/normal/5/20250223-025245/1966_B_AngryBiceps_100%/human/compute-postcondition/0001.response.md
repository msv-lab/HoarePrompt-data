The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer within a specific range, but this variable is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input.**
