The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the input values, `first_row` is the first character of the first input value concatenated with the first character of the second input value, `last_row` is the last character of the first input value concatenated with the last character of the second input value, `i` is 2**
