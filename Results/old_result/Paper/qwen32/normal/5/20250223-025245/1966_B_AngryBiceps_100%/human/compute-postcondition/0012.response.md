The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`. 

Given the initial state, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input provided by the user. After the code execution, `last_row` will be the concatenation of its previous value and the last character of the second element in the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the initial input provided by the user and the second element is the new input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input provided by the user concatenated with the first character of the second element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input provided by the user concatenated with the last character of the second element in the list `a`, `i` is 1.**
