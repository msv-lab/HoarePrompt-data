Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operation. The operation allows us to select two squares of the same color and change all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Key Observations:
1. **Identical Rows:** If all rows are identical, we can use the operation to change the entire grid to the color of any row.
2. **Identical Columns:** Similarly, if all columns are identical, we can use the operation to change the entire grid to the color of any column.
3. **Corner Cases:** If the first and last rows are identical and the first and last columns are identical, but the first row is not the same as the last row, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

### Program Explanation:
The program reads the input for each test case and constructs the grid. It then checks two specific conditions:
1. **First and Last Rows:** It checks if the first and last rows are identical and if they are not, it checks if they are composed of the same single color. If both conditions are true, it prints "NO".
2. **First and Last Columns:** It checks if the first and last columns are identical and if they are not, it checks if they are composed of the same single color. If both conditions are true, it prints "NO".
3. **Otherwise:** If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Identical Rows:** The program correctly checks if all rows are identical or if they are composed of the same single color.
- **Identical Columns:** The program correctly checks if all columns are identical or if they are composed of the same single color.
- **Corner Cases:** The program correctly identifies the corner case where the first and last rows are identical and composed of the same single color, but the first row is not the same as the last row. It also checks the same for columns.

However, the program does not fully cover all possible cases. For example, if the grid has more than two rows or columns, and the first and last rows or columns are not the same but can be made the same through intermediate rows or columns, the program might incorrectly print "NO".

### Counterexample:
Consider a grid like this:
```
WBB
BBW
WBB
```
The first and last rows are not the same, but we can make the entire grid the same color by performing operations on intermediate rows or columns. The program would incorrectly print "NO" for this case.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all cases. It fails to consider scenarios where the grid can be made uniform through intermediate rows or columns.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
