The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`. It will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of these variables.

Here is the reasoning step-by-step:

1. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
2. This statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.
3. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`, but none of these affect the output of the `print` statement.
4. The conditions described in the initial state (e.g., the sizes of character sets in strings) do not influence the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
