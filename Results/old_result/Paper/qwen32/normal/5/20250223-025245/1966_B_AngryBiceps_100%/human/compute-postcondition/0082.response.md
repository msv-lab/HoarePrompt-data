Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, and a grid represented by `n` lines of `m` characters each, where each character is either 'W' (white) or 'B' (black). The function returns the number of white ('W') regions in the grid for each test case.**
