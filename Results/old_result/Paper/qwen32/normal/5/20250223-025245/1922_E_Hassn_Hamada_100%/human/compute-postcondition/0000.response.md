The provided code snippet does not contain any executable statements that modify the initial state. It only includes a docstring describing a function that is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input number. Since no actual operations are performed, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **number is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and sequence is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the required number of increasing subsequences for the corresponding test case.**
