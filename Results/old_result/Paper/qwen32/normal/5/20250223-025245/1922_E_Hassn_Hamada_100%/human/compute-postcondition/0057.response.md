The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, `overlap` is not being iterated over but is used in the range. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and how it changes with each iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `sequence` is a list with an additional element `i + overlap` appended to it.
- The loop condition is `for i in range(size - overlap)`.

Let's break it down:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` had a certain value.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `size - overlap`.

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`sequence` is a list with an additional element `i + overlap` appended to it, `i` is incremented by 1, `size` remains the same, `overlap` remains the same**

Since we are only adjusting the state of objects in the loop head, we need to adjust `i` and keep `size` and `overlap` unchanged.

State: **`sequence` is a list with an additional element `i + overlap` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`**
