To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop condition: `size`, `i`, and `number`. The condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` must be satisfied for the loop to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `size` is `previous_i + 2`
- `value` is `2^(previous_i + 2) - 2^(previous_i - 1)` (not used in the loop condition, so we can ignore it)
- `sequence` is unchanged (not used in the loop condition, so we can ignore it)
- `i` is `previous_i - 1`
- `number` must be at least `(7/2) * 2^(previous_i)`

Let's analyze the loop condition with the given states:
- `size` = `previous_i + 2`
- `i` = `previous_i - 1`
- The condition becomes: `(1 << (previous_i + 2 + 1)) - (1 << (previous_i - 1)) <= number`
- Simplifying: `(1 << (previous_i + 3)) - (1 << (previous_i - 1)) <= number`
- This translates to: `2^(previous_i + 3) - 2^(previous_i - 1) <= number`

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the above condition must be true. Given that `number` must be at least `(7/2) * 2^(previous_i)`, we need to check if this value is sufficient to satisfy the condition.

Let's verify:
- `2^(previous_i + 3) - 2^(previous_i - 1) = 8 * 2^(previous_i) - 0.5 * 2^(previous_i) = 7.5 * 2^(previous_i)`
- For the loop to execute, `7.5 * 2^(previous_i) <= number`
- Since `number` must be at least `(7/2) * 2^(previous_i) = 3.5 * 2^(previous_i)`, it is not sufficient to guarantee the loop can execute again. We need `number` to be at least `7.5 * 2^(previous_i)`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `number` to be at least `7.5 * 2^(previous_i)`.

State: **`size` is `previous_i + 2`, `value` is `2^(previous_i + 2) - 2^(previous_i - 1)`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`, `number` must be at least `7.5 * 2^(previous_i)`**
