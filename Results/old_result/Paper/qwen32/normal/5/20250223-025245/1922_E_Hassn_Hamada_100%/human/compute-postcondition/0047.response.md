The code snippet updates the value of the variable `value` based on the bitwise left shift operation. Here's how the new value of `value` is calculated:

- The original `value` is `2^(previous_i + 2) - 2^(previous_i - 1)`.
- The new `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`.
- Given `size` is `previous_i + 3` and `i` is `previous_i - 1`, we can substitute these into the new value equation:
  - `1 << size` is `1 << (previous_i + 3)` which is `2^(previous_i + 3)`.
  - `1 << i` is `1 << (previous_i - 1)` which is `2^(previous_i - 1)`.
- Therefore, the new `value` is `2^(previous_i + 3) - 2^(previous_i - 1)`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` is `previous_i + 3`, `value` is `2^(previous_i + 3) - 2^(previous_i - 1)`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`, `number` must be at least `7.5 * 2^(previous_i)`**.
