The code increments the `size` variable by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `size` is `previous_i + 3`.

Output State: **`size` is `previous_i + 3`, `value` is `2^(previous_i + 2) - 2^(previous_i - 1)`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`, `number` must be at least `7.5 * 2^(previous_i)`**.
