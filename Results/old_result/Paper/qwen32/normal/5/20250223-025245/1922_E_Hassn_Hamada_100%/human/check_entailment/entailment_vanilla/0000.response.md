To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze if it correctly solves the problem described. The problem requires constructing an array with exactly X increasing subsequences, or determining that it's impossible to do so.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are in strictly increasing order.
   - We need to find an array such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The array length must be at most 200.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the integer X.
   - It then calls `func_1(n - 1, result)`, where `n` is the input X, and `result` is an initially empty list.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the sequence based on the input number.
   - After generating the sequence, the program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1` Explanation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a number and a list to populate with the sequence.
   - It starts by checking if the number is zero. If so, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - It then iterates over possible sizes of subsequences, calculating the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed.
   - It tries to find the largest subsequence size that fits within the remaining number of subsequences.
   - It appends the calculated values to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` seems to be attempting to solve the problem by generating a sequence that corresponds to the number of increasing subsequences.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not directly generate the sequence in a way that guarantees exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The logic of the function is not straightforward and does not provide a clear mapping from the number of subsequences to the array elements.
   - The function also does not handle the case where it's impossible to construct such an array, which should result in `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1` does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly X increasing subsequences, and it does not handle cases where it's impossible to construct such an array.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
