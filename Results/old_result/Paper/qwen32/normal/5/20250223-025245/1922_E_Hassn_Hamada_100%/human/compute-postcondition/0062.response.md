To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the loop and the given initial conditions.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(size - overlap):
    sequence.append(i + overlap)
```

From the given initial state, we know:
- `size` is the first element of `size_overlap`.
- `overlap` is the second element of `size_overlap`.
- The condition `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number` is valid, which helps determine how many times the loop will execute.

The loop runs for `size - overlap` iterations. In each iteration, `i` ranges from `0` to `size - overlap - 1`, and `i + overlap` is appended to the `sequence` list.

Let's break down the given output states for the first few iterations:
- **After 1 iteration**: `sequence` has one element `overlap`.
- **After 2 iterations**: `sequence` has elements `overlap` and `1 + overlap`.
- **After 3 iterations**: `sequence` has elements `overlap`, `1 + overlap`, and `2 + overlap`.

Following this pattern, after `size - overlap` iterations, the `sequence` list will contain elements from `overlap` to `(size - overlap - 1) + overlap`.

In other words, the `sequence` list will contain elements from `overlap` to `size - 1`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`sequence` is a list containing integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`.**

In natural language, this means the `sequence` list will have all integers starting from `overlap` up to `size - 1` inclusive.
