The value of `value` is updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given `size` is 4 and `i` is 1, the calculation becomes `(1 << 4) - (1 << 1)`, which is `16 - 2`, resulting in `14`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`number` must be at least 14, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18), `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is 4, `i` is 1, `value` is 14**.
