To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` is `True`. Let's break down the condition:

- `1 << size + 1` is equivalent to `2^(size + 1)`
- `1 << i` is equivalent to `2^i`
- The condition becomes `2^(size + 1) - 2^i <= number`

Given the initial state:
- `size` is `previous_i`
- `value` is `2^(previous_i - 1)`
- `sequence` is unchanged
- `i` is `previous_i - 1`

Substituting the values of `size` and `i` into the condition, we get:
- `size` is `previous_i`
- `i` is `previous_i - 1`

So the condition becomes:
- `2^(previous_i + 1) - 2^(previous_i - 1) <= number`

To ensure the loop can execute, we need:
- `2^(previous_i + 1) - 2^(previous_i - 1) <= number`

Let's simplify the left-hand side:
- `2^(previous_i + 1) = 2 * 2^(previous_i)`
- `2^(previous_i - 1) = 2^(previous_i) / 2`
- Therefore, `2 * 2^(previous_i) - 2^(previous_i) / 2 = 2^(previous_i) * (2 - 1/2) = 2^(previous_i) * (3/2) = (3/2) * 2^(previous_i)`

So the condition becomes:
- `(3/2) * 2^(previous_i) <= number`

To ensure the loop can execute, `number` must be at least `(3/2) * 2^(previous_i)`.

Thus, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `number` is at least `(3/2) * 2^(previous_i)`.

State: **`size` is `previous_i`, `value` is `2^(previous_i - 1)`, `sequence` is unchanged, `i` is `previous_i - 1`, `number` must be at least `(3/2) * 2^(previous_i)`**
