Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `0`; `leftZero` is increased by 1.**

In simple terms, the variable `leftZero` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
