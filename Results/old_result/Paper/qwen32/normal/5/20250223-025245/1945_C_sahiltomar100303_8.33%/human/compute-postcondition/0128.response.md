To determine what will be printed by the `print(right)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and identify any specific values or conditions related to the variable `right`.

From the initial state, we have the following information:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is 2.
- `s` is "00".
- `mid` is 1.
- `left` is not 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `leftMove` is 0.
- `rightZero` is 1.
- `trightZero` is 0.
- `rightOne` is 0.
- `trightOne` is 0.
- `leftZero` is 0.
- `leftOne` is 0.
- `right` is not equal to 2.
- The absolute difference between `mid` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `mid` and `right`.

The only specific value given for `right` is that it is not equal to 2. However, no other specific value is provided for `right`. Therefore, the exact numerical value of `right` cannot be determined from the given information. The only thing we know is that `right` is some integer not equal to 2.

Thus, the output of the `print(right)` statement will be the value of `right`, which is an integer other than 2.

Output: **right (where right is an integer not equal to 2)**
