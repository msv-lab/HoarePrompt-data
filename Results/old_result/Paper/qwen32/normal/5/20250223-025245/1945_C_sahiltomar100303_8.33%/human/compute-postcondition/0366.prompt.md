Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is adjusted based on the characters moved; `leftOne` is adjusted such that `leftOne` is consistent with `leftZero`; `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is the count of '0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`; `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is the count of non-'0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is adjusted based on the characters moved, minus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is adjusted such that `leftOne` is consistent with `leftZero`; `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is '0', otherwise 0; `trightZero` is the count of '0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`, minus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is '0'; `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`, plus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is not '0'; `trightOne` is the count of non-'0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`, minus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is not '0'; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is `mid + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is adjusted based on the characters moved, minus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is adjusted such that `leftOne` is consistent with `leftZero`; `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is adjusted such that `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2`; if `s[right] == '0'`, then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1; `trightZero` is the count of '0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`, minus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is '0'; `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`, plus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is not '0'; `trightOne` is adjusted such that `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`; if `s[right] != '0'`, then `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is adjusted such that `right < n` and `right` is now `right + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2`; `rightZero` is adjusted based on the characters moved, minus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is adjusted such that `leftOne` is consistent with `leftZero`; `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2`; `tleftZero` is adjusted such that `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2`, and if `s[right] == '0'`, `tleftZero` is now `tleftZero + 1`; `trightZero` is the count of '0' characters from position `mid` to `n-1`, minus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is '0', and if `s[right] == '0'`, `trightZero` is now `trightZero - 1`; `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`, plus 1 if the character at position `right` in `s` is not '0', and if `s[right] != '0'`, `tleftOne` is now `tleftOne + 1`; `trightOne` is adjusted such that `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`, and if `s[right] == '0'`, `trightOne` is now `trightOne - 1`; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is adjusted such that `right < n` and `right` is now its original value before the adjustment.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
