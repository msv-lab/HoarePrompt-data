Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t`; `n` is an integer greater than `mid`; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `mid`; `leftZero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `rightZero` is `0`; `leftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `rightOne` is `0`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is `0`; `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0' characters in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is `0`; `left` is `0`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is the final value when the loop stops. Additionally, the character at position `i` in `s` is '0'.**
