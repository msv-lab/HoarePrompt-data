Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 1; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is either 3 or 4; `trightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is either 0 or 1; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is -2; `leftOne` is either 0 or -1`. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 4 and `leftZero` is -2. Otherwise, `rightOne` is 1 and `leftOne` is -1.**

The value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
