Output State: **`i` is `mid`; `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0; `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged, with `i` still being equal to `mid` and `mid` still being equal to `n // 2` and greater than 0.
