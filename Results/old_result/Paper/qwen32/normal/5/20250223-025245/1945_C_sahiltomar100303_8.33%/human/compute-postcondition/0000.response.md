Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses. This is followed by a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**

In simple terms, the variable `t` has been assigned the number of test cases, while the other conditions regarding the test cases (the values of `n` and the string `a`) remain unchanged.
