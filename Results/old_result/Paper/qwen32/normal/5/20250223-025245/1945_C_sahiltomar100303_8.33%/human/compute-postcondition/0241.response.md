Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the final count of '0's in the first half of `s` after the loop; `rightZero` is the final count of '0's in the second half of `s` after the loop; `leftOne` is the final count of '1's in the first half of `s` after the loop; `rightOne` is the final count of '1's in the second half of `s` after the loop; `tleftZero` is at least `(right + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` after the loop; `tleftOne` is at least `(n // 2 + 1) // 2 - tleftZero`; `trightOne` is at least `(n - right + 1) // 2`; `left` is `0`; `leftMove` is `0`; `right` is the final value when the loop stops and `right` is equal to `n`. Additionally, `left` is currently `0` and `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`.**
