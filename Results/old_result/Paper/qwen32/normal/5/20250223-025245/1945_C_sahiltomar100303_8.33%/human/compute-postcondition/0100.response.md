Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is 2; `s` is "00"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 0; `i` is 2; `leftMove` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; `leftZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0; `right` is 1; `tleftZero` is 2`.**

Natural language: The value of `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
