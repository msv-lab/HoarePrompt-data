The value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged. Since `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, this condition still holds true after the code execution. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `mid`; `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0; `leftZero` is `leftZero + 1`**.
