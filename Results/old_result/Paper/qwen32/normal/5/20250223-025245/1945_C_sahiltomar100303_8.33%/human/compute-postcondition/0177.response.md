The code snippet `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. The initial value of `trightOne` is given as `1` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `0`. Since we are incrementing `trightOne` by 1, its new value will be `2` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is `0`; `rightZero` is `2` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `0`; `leftOne` is `0`; `rightOne` is `3` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `1`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightZero` is `1` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `0`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `trightOne` is `2` if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `1`; `i` is `mid + 1`**.
