Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is 2.
- `s` is "00".
- `mid` is 1.
- `left` is not 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `leftMove` is 0.
- `rightZero` is 1.
- `trightZero` is 0.
- `rightOne` is 0.
- `trightOne` is 0.
- `leftZero` is 0.
- `leftOne` is 0.
- `right` is not equal to 2.
- The absolute difference between `mid` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `mid` and `right`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(left)
```

### Analysis:
From the initial state, we know that `left` is explicitly mentioned as "not 0". However, it does not provide a specific value for `left`. Since the exact value of `left` is not specified, we can only describe it as "not 0".

### Output:
The print statement will output the value of `left`, which is described as "not 0".

Output: **left (where left is not 0)**
