Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is now `t - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `mid`; `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1`; `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the number of test cases `t` remains `t - 1`, `n` is still greater than 0, `s` remains the string input by the user, `mid` is still `n // 2`, `i` is still `mid`, `leftOne` is incremented by 1, and `tleftOne` is also incremented by 1.
