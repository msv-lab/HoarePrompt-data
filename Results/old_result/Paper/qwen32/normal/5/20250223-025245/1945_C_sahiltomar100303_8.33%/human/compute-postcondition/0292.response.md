The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `mid`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `mid`; `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0; `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1`; `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `mid`; `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0; `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1`; `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`**.
