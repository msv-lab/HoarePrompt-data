Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the conditions under which each player can make a move. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - In each turn, a player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will make the best possible move to win.
   - The key to the game is the total number of coins (a + b).
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win.

3. **Explanation of the Winning Conditions**:
   - Consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always leave an odd number of coins for Bob after her turn. Bob, playing optimally, will then leave an even number of coins for Alice, and so on. Eventually, Bob will be left with the last coin and Alice will be unable to make a move, making Bob the winner.
   - Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always leave an even number of coins for Bob. Bob will then leave an odd number of coins for Alice, and so on. Eventually, Alice will be left with the last coin and Bob will be unable to make a move, making Alice the winner.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It calculates the sum of the coins (a + b).
   - It checks if the sum is even or odd using the modulus operator.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Correctness: **True**
