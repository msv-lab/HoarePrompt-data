You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the conditions under which each player can make a move. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns.
   - In each turn, a player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After choosing, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will make the best possible move to win.
   - The key to the game is the total number of coins (a + b).
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win.

3. **Explanation of the Winning Conditions**:
   - Consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always leave an odd number of coins for Bob after her turn. Bob, playing optimally, will then leave an even number of coins for Alice, and so on. Eventually, Bob will be left with the last coin and Alice will be unable to make a move, making Bob the winner.
   - Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always leave an even number of coins for Bob. Bob will then leave an odd number of coins for Alice, and so on. Eventually, Alice will be left with the last coin and Bob will be unable to make a move, making Alice the winner.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It calculates the sum of the coins (a + b).
   - It checks if the sum is even or odd using the modulus operator.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
