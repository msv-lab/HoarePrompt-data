The code snippet provided splits the string `s` into a list of substrings, then converts the second substring (at index 1) to an integer and assigns it to `b`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `s` is the new string input provided; `a` is the integer value of the first substring of the new `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second substring of the new `s`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**

In simpler terms: The value of `b` is updated to be the integer value of the second substring of `s`. All other variables retain their previous values.
