Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided, and 1 <= `t` <= 1000; the loop has executed `t` times; `i` is equal to `t` after the loop has finished; for each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the string `s` was provided, `a` was the integer value of the first substring of `s`, `b` was the integer value of the second substring of `s`, and the program printed 'Bob' if `a + b` was even, otherwise it printed 'Alice'.**

In simpler terms, the loop has finished executing `t` times. For each of those times, the program took an input string `s`, split it into two integers `a` and `b`, and printed 'Bob' if their sum was even, or 'Alice' if their sum was odd. The loop counter `i` is now equal to `t`, reflecting that the loop has completed all its iterations.
