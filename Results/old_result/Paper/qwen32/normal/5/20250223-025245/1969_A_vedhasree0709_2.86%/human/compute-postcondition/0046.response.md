To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must still be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given that `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 2. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop condition.

State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.
