Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of without changing any variables. Otherwise, `j` remains 0, `i` remains 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, with `l` unchanged.**
