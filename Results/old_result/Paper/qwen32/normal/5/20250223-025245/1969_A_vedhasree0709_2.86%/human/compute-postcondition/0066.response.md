Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `l` is a new list of integers read from the input, with the first element of `l` being 2 and the second element of `l` being 1, if the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is true. Otherwise, `j` remains 0, `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `l` is a new list of integers read from the input.**
