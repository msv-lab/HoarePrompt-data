The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so the new value of `i` is 1. The other variables (`j`, `n`, and `l`) remain unchanged. The condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is not re-evaluated in this snippet, so the values of `j`, `i`, `n`, and `l` are as they were before the increment, except for `i` which is now 1.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the current value of `l[i]` is `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1` if the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is true. Otherwise, `j` remains 0, `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input without any changes.**
