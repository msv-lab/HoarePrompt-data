Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is either 2 or 3 if `balance` was less than 0 before the if-else block, otherwise `count` is 1; `balance` is incremented by 1 if `char` is '+', and `balance` is decremented by 1 if `char` is '-' and `balance` was not less than 0; `char` is the next character in `expression`.**

In simple terms, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, `balance`, and `char`) remain unchanged.
