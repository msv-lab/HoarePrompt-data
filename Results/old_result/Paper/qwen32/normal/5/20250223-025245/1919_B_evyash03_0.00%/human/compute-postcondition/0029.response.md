Postcondition: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is 1 if `balance` was not less than 0 before the if-else block, `count` is 2 if `balance` was less than 0 before the if-else block, and `count` is 3 if `balance` was less than 0 and the if part was executed; `balance` is 0 if the if part was executed, otherwise `balance` remains unchanged; `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
