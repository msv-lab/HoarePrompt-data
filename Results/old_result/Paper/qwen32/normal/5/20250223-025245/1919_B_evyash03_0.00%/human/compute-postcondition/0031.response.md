Output State: **The program returns the number of times `balance` was negative and reset to 0, plus 1 if `balance` is currently greater than 0.**

This output state reflects that the return value is the sum of `count` (which tracks how many times `balance` went negative and was reset) and a boolean value (1 if `balance` is greater than 0, 0 otherwise).
