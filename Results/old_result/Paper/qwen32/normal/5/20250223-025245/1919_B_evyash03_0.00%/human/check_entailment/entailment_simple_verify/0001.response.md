### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to split the string `s` (consisting of `+` and `-`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to get the minimum penalty.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the code and the annotations to understand why.

1. **Splitting the String:**
   ```python
   parts = expression.split('-')
   result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
   ```
   This part of the code splits the string `expression` by `-` and sums the lengths of the resulting parts. This does not help in calculating the minimum penalty because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array. The `result_length` variable is not used in the function call `func_1(expression, result_length)`, so this step is redundant and incorrect for solving the problem.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(expression, length):
       count = 0
       balance = 0
       for char in expression:
           if char == '+':
               balance += 1
           elif char == '-':
               balance -= 1
           if balance < 0:
               count += 1
               balance = 0
       return count + (balance > 0)
   ```
   This function is intended to count the number of times the balance (the sum of the subarray) goes negative and adds an extra count if the balance is positive at the end. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. It does not consider the length of the subarrays or the absolute value of their sums.

   The annotations state:
   ```python
   #State: expression is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length `length`; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is the number of times `balance` was negative and reset to 0; `balance` is 0.
   return count + (balance > 0)
   #The program returns the number of times `balance` was negative and reset to 0, plus 1 if `balance` is currently greater than 0.
   ```
   This description is accurate but does not reflect the correct logic for minimizing the penalty. The function `func_1` does not account for the length of the subarrays or their absolute sums, which are crucial for calculating the penalty.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm. The idea is to find the optimal way to split the array such that the sum of penalties is minimized. This involves considering the balance of the subarrays and their lengths.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
