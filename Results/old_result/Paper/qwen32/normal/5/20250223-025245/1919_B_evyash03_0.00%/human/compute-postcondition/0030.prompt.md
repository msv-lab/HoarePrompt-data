Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: expression is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters, and length is a positive integer representing the length of the string expression such that length == len(expression); count is 0; balance is 0.
Code of the loop:
for char in expression:
    if char == '+':
        balance += 1
    elif char == '-':
        balance -= 1
    if balance < 0:
        count += 1
        balance = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1, `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`, `count` is 1 if `balance` was less than 0, otherwise `count` remains 0, and `balance` is 0 if `balance` was less than 0 and `char` is '-', otherwise `balance` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is either 1 or 2 if `balance` was less than 0 before the if-else block, otherwise `count` remains 0; `balance` is 0 if `balance` was less than 0 before the if-else block, otherwise `balance` is incremented by 1 if `char` is '+', and if `char` is '-' and `balance` was not less than 0, `balance` is decremented by 1, otherwise `balance` remains 0; `char` is the next character in `expression`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is 1 if `balance` was not less than 0 before the if-else block, `count` is 2 if `balance` was less than 0 before the if-else block, and `count` is 3 if `balance` was less than 0 and the if part was executed; `balance` is 0 if the if part was executed, otherwise `balance` remains unchanged; `char` is the next character in `expression`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
