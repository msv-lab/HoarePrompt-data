The code snippet `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, `balance`, and `char`) are not affected by this operation.

Given that `count` was either 0 or 1 before this operation (depending on the condition `balance < 0` before the if-else block), after the increment, `count` will be either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1; `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`; `count` is either 1 or 2; `balance` is incremented by 1 if `char` is '+', and if `char` is '-' and `balance` was not less than 0, `balance` is decremented by 1, otherwise `balance` remains 0; `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
