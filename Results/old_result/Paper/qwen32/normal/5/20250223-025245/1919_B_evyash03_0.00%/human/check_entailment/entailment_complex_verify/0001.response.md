### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to determine if it correctly solves the given problem. The goal is to find the minimum penalty when splitting the array derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task involves transforming the string `s` into an array `a` where each `+` corresponds to `1` and each `-` corresponds to `-1`. The objective is to split this array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Splitting the String:**
   ```python
   parts = expression.split('-')
   result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
   ```
   - This part of the code splits the string `expression` by `-` and sums the lengths of the resulting parts. This operation does not contribute to the calculation of the minimum penalty. It appears to be a misstep in the logic, as it does not consider the optimal way to split the array.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(expression, length):
       count = 0
       balance = 0
       for char in expression:
           if char == '+':
               balance += 1
           elif char == '-':
               balance -= 1
           if balance < 0:
               count += 1
               balance = 0
       return count + (balance > 0)
   ```
   - This function iterates through the string `expression`, maintaining a `balance` that increases with `+` and decreases with `-`.
   - When `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count` plus 1 if `balance` is positive at the end.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations confirm that `count` keeps track of how many times `balance` went negative and was reset to 0, and `balance` is 0 at the end of the function.
- The function returns the number of times `balance` was negative and reset to 0, plus 1 if `balance` is positive at the end.

### Correctness of the Program:
The provided program does **not** correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

- **Incorrect Approach:**
  - The program uses a method that counts the number of times the balance goes negative and resets it, which does not account for the length of subarrays or the absolute value of their sums.
  - The program does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which involves more sophisticated logic such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach.

- **Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach:**
  - To solve this problem correctly, one would need to use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal splits that minimize the total penalty.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
