The only variable in the loop head is `char`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression` string. Since the loop iterates over each character in `expression`, at the start of the next iteration, `char` will be the next character in the string.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1.
- `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`.
- `count` is 1 if `balance` was less than 0, otherwise `count` remains 0.
- `balance` is 0 if `balance` was less than 0 and `char` is '-', otherwise `balance` remains unchanged.

To execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in `expression`. Since we do not have the specific value of `char` at the end of the previous iteration, we can only say that `char` will be the next character in the sequence.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length at least 1, `length` is a positive integer such that `length == len(expression)`, `count` is 1 if `balance` was less than 0, otherwise `count` remains 0, and `balance` is 0 if `balance` was less than 0 and `char` is '-', otherwise `balance` remains unchanged, `char` is the next character in `expression`**
