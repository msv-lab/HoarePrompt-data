Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for each test case. The logic in `func_1` is not designed to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. Instead, it counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the balance is positive at the end, which does not account for the penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.

To solve the problem optimally, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy that considers the penalty of each possible split is required. The current implementation does not achieve this and thus is incorrect.
