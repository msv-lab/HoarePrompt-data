Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list where each index `j` contains the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `ul` is the sum of 2 for each time `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` occurred up to the point where the loop breaks or all iterations are completed, `ur` is 0, `res` contains all elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, `k` is either a non-zero integer (if the if part was executed) or retains its value (if the else part was executed, which is not applicable here as there is no else part), `re` is the count of elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, and `i` is the last index that was processed, which is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, or the index where `re` equals `k`.**
