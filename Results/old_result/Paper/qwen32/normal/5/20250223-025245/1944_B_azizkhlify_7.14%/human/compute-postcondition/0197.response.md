Output State: **`ul` is equal to `ur`; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is incremented by 1; if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is incremented by 2 and `ul` is also incremented by 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or if statement. As a result, `ul` and `ur` become equal. The values of `n` and the increment of `i` by 1 remain unchanged. If the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true, both `ur` and `ul` would have been incremented by 2, but since we are breaking out of the loop or if statement, this increment does not occur in the output state.
