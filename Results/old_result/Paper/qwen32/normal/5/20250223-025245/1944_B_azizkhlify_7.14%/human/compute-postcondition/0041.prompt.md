Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: - `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `k` remains the second integer read from the input.
- `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input.
- `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`.
- `re` remains 0.
- `ul` remains 0.
- `ur` remains 0.
- `res` remains an empty list.

In simpler terms, the list `r` will have its elements incremented based on the values in the second half of the list `a` (from index `n` to `2*n - 1`), while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` remains the second integer read from the input, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `re` remains 0, `ul` is 2 if `ul == k * 2`, otherwise `ul` remains 0, `ur` remains 0, and `res` remains an empty list. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` remains the second integer read from the input, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `re` remains 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` or if `ul` was already `k * 2`, otherwise `ul` remains 0, `ur` remains 0, and `res` remains an empty list. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `i` is `n-1`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` remains the second integer read from the input, `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input, `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`, `re` remains 0, `ur` remains 0, and `res` remains an empty list. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `ul` is not equal to `k * 2`, no changes are made to the state of the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
