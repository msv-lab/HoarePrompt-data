The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, to start the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again from its current value. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Given that `ul` equals `ur` does not affect the loop's iteration control but rather the flow within the loop, it does not influence the state of `i` or `n` for the next iteration.

State: **`r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is the same as before**.

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `x + 1` at the start of the next iteration. So, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

State: **`r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can represent the state as:

State: **`r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is the same as before**.
