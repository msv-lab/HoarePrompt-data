Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
2. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
3. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.
4. `l` is a list where each index `j` contains the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.
5. `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
6. `ul` and `ur` are both initialized to 0.
7. `res` is an empty list.
8. `k` is the second integer from the input.
9. `re` is initialized to 0.
10. `i` is initialized to 0.
11. `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, which means the element at index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Given that `i` is initialized to 0, the statement effectively prints `a[0]` twice, separated by a space, and does not print a newline at the end.

### Determining the Value of `a[0]`:
From the initial state, we know that `l[a[0] - 1]` is 2. This means that the value `a[0]` appears twice in the list `a`. However, the exact value of `a[0]` is not specified in the initial state, only that it appears twice.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact value of `a[0]` is not known, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[0]`.

Output: **a[0] a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list `a`)**
