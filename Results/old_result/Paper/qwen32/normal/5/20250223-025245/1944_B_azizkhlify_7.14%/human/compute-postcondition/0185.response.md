Output State: **`ul` is equal to `ur`; `n` is a non-negative integer; if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ur` is increased by 2, and the current value of `ul` and `ur` is the same; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `ul` and `ur` remain equal, `n` remains a non-negative integer, and the condition involving `r[a[i] - 1]` and the increase of `ur` by 2 still holds if applicable. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
