The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an index within the bounds of `a`, and it has been incremented from its previous value. Since the loop runs from `n` to `2 * n`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since `n` does not change within the loop, it remains the same.

State: **`r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.

Given that we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`r` is a list, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `n` is the same as before**.
