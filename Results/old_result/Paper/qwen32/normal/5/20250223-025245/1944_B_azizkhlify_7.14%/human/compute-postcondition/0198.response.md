Postcondition: **`ul` is equal to `ur` if the if condition was met and the loop or if statement was broken out of. `n` is a non-negative integer. `i` is incremented by 1. If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is incremented by 2, and if the if condition was met, `ul` is also incremented by 2. If the if condition was not met, `ul` remains unchanged.**
