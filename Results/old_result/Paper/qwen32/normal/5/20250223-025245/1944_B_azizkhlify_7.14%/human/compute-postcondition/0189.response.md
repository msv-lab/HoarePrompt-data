Output State: **`ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the if condition was met and the loop or if statement was broken out of, in which case `ul` and `ur` are equal. `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ur` is increased by 2. `i` is `i + 1`. `ur` is increased by 2.**

Natural Language: The value of `ur` is increased by 2. All other conditions and variable states remain the same as in the initial state, except for the updated value of `ur`.
