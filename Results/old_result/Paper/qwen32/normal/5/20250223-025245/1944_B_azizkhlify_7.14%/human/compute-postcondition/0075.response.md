To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Key Variables and Their Context:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This likely represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly relevant to the current print statement.
2. **`n`**: The first integer read from the input, representing the number of elements in the list `a`.
3. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers read from the input.
4. **`l`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`. Essentially, `l` counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` when considering 1-based indexing.
5. **`r`**: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`. This implies that `r` counts occurrences of elements in the second half of `a` (if `a` had `2*n` elements, but the description suggests `a` has `n` elements, so `r` might be a typo or misinterpretation).
6. **`ul`**: Either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations. This variable seems to be related to the loop's behavior.
7. **`ur`**: Remains 0. This variable seems to be unused or irrelevant for the current print statement.
8. **`res`**: A list containing at least one element. This list seems to store some results or indices.
9. **`k`**: Updated to `2 * k - ul` if non-zero. This variable seems to be used in some loop or calculation.
10. **`re`**: The number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed. This variable counts specific occurrences in `l`.
11. **`i`**: The next element in `res`. This is the variable that will be printed.

### Analysis:
The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the current value of `i` from the `res` list, followed by a space. The exact value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values in `res`. However, based on the context, `i` is an element from `res`, which is a list that holds some results.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `res` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variable `i` from the list `res`.

Output: **i (where i is an element from the res list)**
