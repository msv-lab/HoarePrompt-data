To determine the output of the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the value of `a[i]` at the point where the print statement is executed. Let's break down the given initial state and the relevant parts of the code.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Variables and Lists:**
   - `ul`: Calculated as `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `ul` is `2 * n`.
   - `ur`: Initialized to 0.
   - `re`: Incremented by 1 if `l[a[4] - 1] == 1`; otherwise, remains unchanged.
   - `n`: A positive integer.
   - `k`: A non-zero integer, updated as `2 * k - ul`.
   - `a`: A list of integers read from input.
   - `l`: A list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`.
   - `r`: A list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
   - `res`: A list containing `a[4]` if `l[a[4] - 1] == 1`; otherwise, remains unchanged.
   - `i`: Initialized to 5.
   - `re` is used to exit the loop if `re` equals `k`.

2. **Relevant Code:**
   - The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`.

### Analysis:
- The value of `i` is explicitly given as 5.
- The print statement will output the element at index 5 of the list `a`.

### Conclusion:
The output of the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement is the element at index 5 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[5] (where a[5] is the element at index 5 of the list `a`)**
