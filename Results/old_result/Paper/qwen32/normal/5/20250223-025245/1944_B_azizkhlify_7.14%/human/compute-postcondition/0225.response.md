Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `ul`, `ur`, `re` are all set to 0.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input.
- `l` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each index `j` contains the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in `a` from index `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
- `i` is 0.
- `res` is an empty list.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

### Analysis:
- `i` is initialized to 0, so `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.
- The condition `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2 indicates that the number `a[0]` (the first element of `a`) appears exactly 2 times in the list `a`.
- The print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and will not move to a new line after the print statement (due to `end=' '`).

### Output:
Since `a[i]` is `a[0]` and `l[a[0] - 1]` is 2, it means the first element of the list `a` appears exactly 2 times in the list. However, the specific value of `a[0]` is not given, so we can only describe it as `a[0]`.

Output: **a[0] a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list `a`)**
