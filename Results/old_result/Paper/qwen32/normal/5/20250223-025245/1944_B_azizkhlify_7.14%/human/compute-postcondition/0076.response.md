To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')
```
The loop iterates over each element in the list `res` and prints it. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `res`.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
- `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged.
- `res` contains elements that are printed in each iteration.
- `k` is updated based on `ul` if it's non-zero.
- `re` counts the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1.

The loop will execute until all elements in `res` have been processed. Therefore, after all iterations, `res` will be empty because each element is processed and removed from the list during each iteration.

The final output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` remains the first integer read from the input.
- `a` remains the list of `n` integers read from the input.
- `l` remains a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in `a`.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `a[i]` in the range from `a[n]` to `a[2*n - 1]`.
- `ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop broke or less than `k * 2` if the loop completed all iterations.
- `ur` remains 0.
- `res` is an empty list because all elements have been processed.
- `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` if non-zero, based on the last iteration.
- `re` is the number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed.

Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n remains the first integer read from the input, a remains the list of n integers read from the input, l remains a list of n integers where each element at index a[i] - 1 is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of a[i] in a, r is a list of n integers where each element at index a[i] - 1 has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of a[i] in the range from a[n] to a[2*n - 1], ul is either k * 2 if the loop broke or less than k * 2 if the loop completed all iterations, ur remains 0, res is an empty list, k is updated to 2 * k - ul if non-zero, re is the number of times l[a[i] - 1] was equal to 1 before the loop broke or until all iterations were completed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `res` will be empty, and all other variables will remain in their states as described, with `k` updated if it was non-zero.
