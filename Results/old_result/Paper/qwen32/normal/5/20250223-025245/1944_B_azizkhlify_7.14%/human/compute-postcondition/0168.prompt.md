Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list where each index `j` contains the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `ul` is the sum of 2 for each time `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` occurred up to the point where the loop breaks or all iterations are completed, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `k` is a non-zero integer (`k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not equal to 0), `re` is 0, `i` is the index at which the loop stopped.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and if `re` is equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `re` and `res` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` includes `a[2]`. Otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
