To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the variables involved. The loop iterates over the elements in the list `res` and prints each element. 

Given the loop:
```python
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')
```

The loop will continue until all elements in `res` have been processed. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, `k`, and `re` remain unchanged during the loop execution as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will take on the value of each element in `res` in sequence.

Let's summarize the final state:

1. **t**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
2. **n**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
3. **a**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
4. **l**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
5. **r**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
6. **ul**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
7. **ur**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
8. **res**: Contains the elements that will be printed. It remains unchanged in terms of its contents during the loop but is iterated over.
9. **k**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
10. **re**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.
11. **i**: Takes on the value of each element in `res` during the loop iterations. After the loop completes, `i` will be the last element of `res`.

The loop will print each element of `res` separated by a space. After all elements in `res` have been printed, the loop terminates.

**Output State:** **t remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a is a list of integers read from the input, l is a list where each index j contains the count of how many times j+1 appears in a, r is a list of n zeros with the value at index a[i] - 1 incremented by 1 for each i from n to 2 * n - 1, ul is the sum of 2 for each time l[a[i] - 1] == 2 occurred up to the point where the loop breaks or all iterations are completed, ur is 0, res contains all elements a[i] for which l[a[i] - 1] == 1 up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, k is either a non-zero integer (if the if part was executed) or retains its value (if the else part was executed, which is not applicable here as there is no else part), re is the count of elements a[i] for which l[a[i] - 1] == 1 up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, i is the last element in res.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, all elements in `res` will have been printed, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, `k`, and `re` will retain their initial values. The variable `i` will be set to the last element of `res`.
