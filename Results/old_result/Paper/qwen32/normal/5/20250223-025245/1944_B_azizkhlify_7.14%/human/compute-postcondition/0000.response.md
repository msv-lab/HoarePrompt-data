The for loop provided is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head contains the variable `_` and the function `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a certain number of times. The number of times the loop will execute is determined by the integer value provided by `int(input())`.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, it indicates that there are `t` test cases. For the loop to execute, the input to `int(input())` must be `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that the input function `input()` returns `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `input()` returns `t`**
