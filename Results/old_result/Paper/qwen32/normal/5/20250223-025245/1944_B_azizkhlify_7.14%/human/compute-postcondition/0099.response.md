Postcondition: **`t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `l` remains the same, `r` remains the same, `ul` is either less than `k * 2` or equal to `ur` (which is 0), `ur` remains 0, `res` remains an empty list, `k` remains the same if `ul` is not zero, `re` remains the same.**
