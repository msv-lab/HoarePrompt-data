To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variable `t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
2. **Variable `n`**: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
3. **List `a`**: A list of integers read from the input.
4. **List `l`**: A list where each index `j` contains the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`.
5. **List `r`**: A list of `n` zeros with the value at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
6. **Variable `ul`**: The sum of 2 for each time `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` occurred up to the point where the loop breaks or all iterations are completed.
7. **Variable `ur`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **List `res`**: Must contain at least one element.
9. **Variable `k`**: Assigned a non-zero integer if the if part was executed (no else part mentioned).
10. **Variable `re`**: The count of elements `a[i]` for which `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes.
11. **Variable `i`**: The next element in `res`.

The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

Given the initial state and the description of the variables, the value of `i` is the next element in the list `res`. Since the exact content of `res` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`. However, we know that `i` is an element of `res`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement will be the next element in the list `res`.

Output: **i (where i is the next element in the list `res`)**
