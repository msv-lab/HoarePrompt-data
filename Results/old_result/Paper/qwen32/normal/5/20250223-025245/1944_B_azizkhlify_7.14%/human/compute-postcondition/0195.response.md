The value of `ur` is incremented by 2. The values of `ul`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the if condition was met and the loop or if statement was broken out of, in which case `ul` and `ur` are equal. `n` remains a non-negative integer, and `i` remains incremented by 1.

Output State: **`ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the if condition was met and the loop or if statement was broken out of, in which case `ul` and `ur` are equal; `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is incremented by 1; `ur` is incremented by 2.**
