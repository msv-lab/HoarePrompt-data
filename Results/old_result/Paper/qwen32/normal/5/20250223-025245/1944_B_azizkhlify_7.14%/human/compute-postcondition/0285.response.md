Postcondition: **`ul` is `k * 2` if `k * 2` is reached before `n` iterations; otherwise, `2 * n`. `ur` is 2 if the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 2; otherwise, `ur` is 0. `re` is the number of unique elements with count 1 found in `a` up to `k` or `n` iterations. `ul` equals `ur`. `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `res`, and `i` are unchanged.**
