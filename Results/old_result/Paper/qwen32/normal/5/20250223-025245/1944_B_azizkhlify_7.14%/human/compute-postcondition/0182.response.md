`ur` is incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.
Output State: **`ul` is not equal to `ur`; `n` is a non-negative integer; `r[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2; `ur` is increased by 2.**
