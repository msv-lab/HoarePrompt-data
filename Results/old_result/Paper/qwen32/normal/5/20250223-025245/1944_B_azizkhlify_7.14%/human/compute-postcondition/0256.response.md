To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the relationships and values of the variables involved.

1. **Variable `a`**: The problem states that `a` is a list of integers read from input. However, the specific values in the list `a` are not provided. Therefore, we can only refer to the element at index `i` in the list `a` as `a[i]`.

2. **Variable `i`**: The problem explicitly states that `i` is 4. Therefore, we need to determine the value of `a[4]`.

3. **Print Statement**: The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `i` (which is 4) of the list `a`, followed by a space.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[4]`. However, we know that `a[4]` is the element at index 4 in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the element at index 4 of the list `a`, followed by a space.

Output: **a[4] ** (where `a[4]` is the element at index 4 in the list `a`)
