To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This variable is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than or equal to 1. This variable also does not directly influence the provided code snippet.
3. **`i`**: An integer with an explicit value of 2.
4. **`re` and `res`**: These variables are mentioned in the context of a loop or condition (if `re` equals `k`, the loop or if statement is broken out of, and `re` and `res` remain unchanged). However, they are not directly used in the provided code snippet.
5. **`a`**: This is an array or list, and the code snippet prints the element at index `i`, which is 2.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```
- `a[i]`: This accesses the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
- `end=' '`: This specifies that after printing the element, a space should be added instead of a newline.

### Determining the Output:
From the initial state, we know that `i` is 2. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Since the exact contents of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical value that will be printed. However, we know that the output will be the element at index 2 of the list `a`, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list `a`)**
