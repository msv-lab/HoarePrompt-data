t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case and contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 500) followed by a list of n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 <= x_i <= 500). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
