Let's analyze the code snippet and its impact on the variables.

Given:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input.
- `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500.

The code snippet:
```python
a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
```

This line of code updates the `i`-th element of list `a` by setting it to the sum of the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` and the `(i-1)`-th element of `x`.

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `a` is a list where the `i`-th element is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains the same. The value of `n` is still greater than 1. The list `x` remains unchanged as it is the user's input. The list `a` is updated such that the `i`-th element of `a` is now the sum of the previous element in `a` and the previous element in `x`.
