The provided loop in the task is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head only contains the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The underscore `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's state. The loop will execute based on the integer input, which is not modified within the loop itself.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide any specific information about the loop control variable (since it is `_`), and the loop runs a fixed number of times determined by the input, we do not need to adjust any variables in the loop head for the next iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as the specified number of iterations has not been reached.

Since the loop head does not contain any variables that need adjustment and the state of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `a` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be modified.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration with respect to the loop head.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of length `n` where `a[0]` is 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`.**
