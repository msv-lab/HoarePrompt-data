The provided code snippet updates the list `a` by setting `a[i]` to the value of `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500.

The code modifies the list `a` by updating each element starting from the second element (index 1) up to the `n`-th element. Specifically, `a[i]` is set to the sum of the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the corresponding element in `x`, `x[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.**

In simpler terms, the first element of `a` remains 500, and each subsequent element of `a` is calculated as the sum of the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`.
