To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the list `a` is constructed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the number of elements in the list `x`.
- `x` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list of length `n` where:
  - `a[0]` is initialized to 500.
  - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is calculated as the cumulative sum of the previous element of `a` and the corresponding element of `x`. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
    \[
    a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]
    \]

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The first element of `a` is explicitly set to 500.
2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` in the list `a` (starting from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`), the value is computed by adding the previous element in `a` (`a[i-1]`) to the corresponding element in `x` (`x[i-1]`).

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `n = 4` and `x = [10, 20, 30]`.
- The list `a` would be constructed as follows:
  - `a[0] = 500` (initial value)
  - `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + 10 = 510`
  - `a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = 510 + 20 = 530`
  - `a[3] = a[2] + x[2] = 530 + 30 = 560`
- Therefore, the list `a` would be `[500, 510, 530, 560]`.

### General Case:
For any given `n` and `x`, the list `a` is constructed by starting with 500 and then iteratively adding each element of `x` to the cumulative sum.

### Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **500, a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1] (where each a[i] is the cumulative sum of a[i-1] and x[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1, starting with a[0] = 500)**
