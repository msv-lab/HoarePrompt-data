You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 500
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of the user's input for each test case, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input for each test case, and `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n - 1`) is the cumulative sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`, starting with `a[0] = 500`. The loop processes each test case independently, and for each test case, it prints the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it constructs a list `a` of length `n` starting with `a[0] = 500`. Each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. It then prints the list `a` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always produce an array `a` that satisfies the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. 

Let's examine why the code is incorrect by considering a test case:

Input:
```
2
3
1 1
3
2 3
```

Expected Output:
For the first test case, a valid output could be:
```
2 3 4
```
Explanation: 
- `3 % 2 = 1`
- `4 % 3 = 1`

For the second test case, a valid output could be:
```
3 5 8
```
Explanation:
- `5 % 3 = 2`
- `8 % 5 = 3`

However, the provided code will output:
```
500 501 502
500 502 505
```
Explanation:
- `501 % 500 = 1` (correct for the first test case)
- `502 % 501 = 1` (correct for the first test case)
- `502 % 500 = 2` (correct for the second test case)
- `505 % 502 = 3` (correct for the second test case)

While the code happens to work for these specific cases, it does not guarantee that it will work for all possible inputs. The logic in the code is to simply add `x[i-1]` to `a[i-1]` to get `a[i]`, which does not necessarily result in the correct `a_i mod a_{i-1}` being equal to `x_i`.

Let's consider another test case where the code will fail:
Input:
```
2
3
1 2
3
2 1
```

Expected Output:
For the first test case, a valid output could be:
```
2 3 5
```
Explanation:
- `3 % 2 = 1`
- `5 % 3 = 2`

For the second test case, a valid output could be:
```
3 5 7
```
Explanation:
- `5 % 3 = 2`
- `7 % 5 = 2` (incorrect, should be `7 % 5 = 2` but we need `7 % 5 = 1`)

The provided code will output:
```
500 501 503
500 502 503
```
Explanation:
- `501 % 500 = 1` (correct for the first test case)
- `503 % 501 = 2` (correct for the first test case)
- `502 % 500 = 2` (correct for the second test case but incorrect logic, should be `502 % 500 = 2` but we need `502 % 500 = 2` and `503 % 502 = 1`)

Thus, the code is not guaranteed to work for all inputs, and therefore it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
