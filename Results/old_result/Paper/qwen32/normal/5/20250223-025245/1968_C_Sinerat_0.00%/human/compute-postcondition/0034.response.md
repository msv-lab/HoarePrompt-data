The code snippet updates the `i`-th element of list `a` by adding the `(i-1)`-th element of list `a` to the `(i-1)`-th element of list `x`. Given `i` is 2, the 2nd element of `a` (`a[2]`) is updated to be the sum of the 1st element of `a` (`a[1]`) and the 1st element of `x` (`x[1]`).

Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the user's input, `a` is a list where the 2nd element is updated to `a[1] + x[1]`, `i` is 2.**
