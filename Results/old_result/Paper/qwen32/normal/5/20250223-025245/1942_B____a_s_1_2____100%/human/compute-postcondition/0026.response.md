Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements remain `-1`; `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`; `i` is decremented by 1**

In this output state, the value of `p[i]` has been updated to `mex - a[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions, with `i` being decremented by 1.
