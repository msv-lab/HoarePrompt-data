The given code snippet updates the list `a` by reading a new list of integers from the input. The initial state of `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, but this line of code will overwrite it with a new input list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `mex`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where each `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` at the time of its calculation, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step; `mex` is the smallest value in the list `p`.**
