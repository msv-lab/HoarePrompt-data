Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers with `p[0]` updated to `mex - a[0]` and all other elements initialized to -1; `mex` is the minimum of `n`, `n - a[0]`, and `p[0]`; `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `mex` is recalculated to be the minimum of its previous value and `p[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `p[i]` is `p[0]`, which is `mex - a[0]`. Therefore, `mex` is now the minimum of `n`, `n - a[0]`, and `mex - a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
