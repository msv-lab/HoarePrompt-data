The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations to perform. The loop will execute `t` times, and at the end of each iteration, `_` is implicitly incremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1
- `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `p` is a list of integers where each `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` at the time of its calculation, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step
- `mex` is the smallest value in the list `p`

At the start of the next iteration, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, and `mex`) do not change based on the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where each `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` at the time of its calculation, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step; `mex` is the smallest value in the list `p`**. 

Since `_` is incremented by 1, we should specify this change explicitly in the state description for clarity, even though it's not part of the provided variables to adjust:

State: **`_` is incremented by 1; `t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where each `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` at the time of its calculation, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step; `mex` is the smallest value in the list `p`**.

However, since `_` is not explicitly part of the state provided to adjust, we can simply state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of integers where each `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` at the time of its calculation, with `mex` being updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` at each step; `mex` is the smallest value in the list `p`**.
