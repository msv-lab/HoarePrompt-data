Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` from an array `a` of length `n` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

### Key Concepts:
- **MEX (Minimum EXcluded Value):** The smallest non-negative integer not present in the given list.
- **Permutation:** An arrangement of numbers from `0` to `n-1` without repetition.

### Approach Analysis:
The program uses a reverse construction approach to determine `p` from `a`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the largest possible value that can be the MEX of a permutation of length `n`.
   - `p` is initialized to an array of `-1` values of length `n`.

2. **Reverse Construction:**
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Reverse Construction Logic:** The reverse construction logic seems flawed. The MEX should be determined by the elements already placed in `p` up to that point, not by a pre-calculated `mex` value. The provided program does not correctly compute the MEX at each step as it should be based on the constructed part of `p` so far.
- **MEX Calculation:** The MEX calculation in the program is not correctly reflecting the MEX of the constructed part of `p`. The MEX should be recalculated based on the elements already assigned in `p` up to the current index, not just by decrementing the `mex` value.
- **Example Validation:** Let's validate with the first example:
  - Input: `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - Expected `p`: `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
  - The program calculates `p` as `[2, 0, 4, 3, 1]` which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. The reverse construction logic and MEX calculation are not correctly implemented.

**Correctness: False**
