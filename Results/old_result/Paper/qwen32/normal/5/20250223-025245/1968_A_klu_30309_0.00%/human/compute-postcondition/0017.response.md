The code snippet assigns the value of `y` to `max_val`. This does not affect the conditions or the return statement mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the conditions `x` is greater than 2, and `y` is one less than its original value, remain valid. Additionally, the return statement condition `if 2 * y >= x` is not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 2, `y` is one less than its original value, and `max_val` is equal to `y`.**
