Given the conditions:
- `x` must be greater than 2.
- `max_val` is 1.
- `x` is divisible by `y`.
- `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`.

The code snippet:
```
return y
```

Based on the provided conditions, the program returns the value of `y`. `y` is a divisor of `x` such that `2 * y >= x` and `x > 2`.

Output State: **The program returns `y`, which is a divisor of `x` satisfying `2 * y >= x` and `x > 2`.**
