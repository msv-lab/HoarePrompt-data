The only variable in the loop head is `y`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `y` is greater than 1 and less than `x - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` was some value, and it will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Given that `x` must be greater than 2, and `y` is currently some value that allows the loop to continue, we need to adjust `y` to be one less than its current value for the next iteration.

State: **`x` must be greater than 2, `max_val` is `y` if `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y` is less than `x`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains 1, `y` is `y - 1`**
