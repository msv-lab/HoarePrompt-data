To determine if the provided program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic and the functions provided. The task is to distribute the bets in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

Let's break down the problem and the program:

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of outcomes.
     - `k`: A list of multipliers for each outcome.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, output either:
     - `-1` if no valid distribution of bets is possible.
     - `x`: A list of bets such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Key Requirements:
- The total bet must be less than the return for each winning outcome.
- If a solution exists, it should be output in the form of a list of bets.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The provided program includes two functions:
1. **`func_1(a, b)`**: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
2. **`func_2(numbers)`**: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers.

However, the program does not actually compute the bets. The functions provided (`func_1` and `func_2`) are related to finding the LCM, which could be useful for finding a common multiple of the multipliers, but they do not directly solve the problem of distributing the bets.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem, we need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet is less than the return for each winning outcome. One simple and effective strategy is to set each bet `x_i` to `LCM(k) // k_i - 1`, where `LCM(k)` is the least common multiple of all multipliers. This ensures that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Correctness of the Provided Program:
The provided program does not implement the logic to compute and output the bets. It only computes the LCM of the multipliers, which is a step towards solving the problem but does not complete it.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is not correct because it does not output the required bets for each test case. It only computes the LCM of the multipliers, which is a part of the solution but not the complete solution.

**Correctness: False**
