Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is `'05'`, `h1` is `'05'` and `time` is `'AM'`. Otherwise, if `h` is any value from `'06'` to `'12'`, `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is `'AM'`. If `h` is any value from `'13'` to `'23'`, `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format with `'PM'` as `time`. If `h` is `'00'`, `h1` is `'12'` and `time` is `'PM'`. If `h` does not match any of the specified values, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.**
