Correctness: **False**

The provided program is not correct because it incorrectly handles the conversion of the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. Specifically, the program incorrectly assigns "PM" to "00:00" and does not handle the "AM" designation correctly for hours from "00" to "11". Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect AM/PM assignment for "00:00":** The program assigns "PM" to "00:00", which should be "12:00 AM".
2. **Incorrect handling of hours from "00" to "11":** The program should assign "AM" to all hours from "00" to "11", except for "00", which should be "12 AM".
3. **Redundant code:** The program uses multiple `if-elif` statements to map hours from "00" to "23" to their 12-hour format equivalents. This can be simplified using arithmetic operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = input().split(':')
        h = int(h)
        period = 'AM'
        if h == 0:
            h1 = 12
        elif h > 12:
            h1 = h - 12
            period = 'PM'
        elif h == 12:
            h1 = 12
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h
            
        print(f"{h1:02}:{m} {period}")

func()
```

This corrected version handles the conversion correctly:
- It converts "00:00" to "12:00 AM".
- It correctly assigns "AM" to hours from "01" to "11".
- It correctly assigns "PM" to hours from "13" to "23".
- It ensures that the hour is always printed with two digits using `f"{h1:02}"`.
