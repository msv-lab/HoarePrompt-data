To determine the output, let's break down the code and the given initial state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
- `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input `s`.
- `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input `s`.
- `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s` (which is the same as `m`).
- `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h`:
  - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '01' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '12', `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'PM'.
  - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is '01' to '11' respectively and `time` is 'PM'.

### Code to Execute:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extracting `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - `s` is a string in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the first two characters of `s` (representing the hour).
   - `m` is the last two characters of `s` (representing the minute).

2. **Determining `h1` and `time`:**
   - Based on the value of `h`, `h1` and `time` are set according to the rules provided.
   - For example, if `h` is '14', `h1` will be '02' and `time` will be 'PM'.

3. **Printing the Output:**
   - The `print` statement concatenates `h1`, ':', `m`, ' ', and `time` without any separator (due to `sep=''`).

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `s` is "14:30":
- `h` = '14'
- `m` = '30'
- Since `h` is '14', `h1` = '02' and `time` = 'PM'.
- The `print` statement will output: `02:30 PM`.

### General Case:
Given the initial state and the rules, the output will be in the format `h1:m time` where `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h`.

### Final Output:
Output: **h1:m time (where h1 and time are determined based on the value of h and m is the minute part of the input string s)**

However, to provide a more concrete example based on the format provided in the task:
If `s` is "14:30":
Output: **02:30 PM**
