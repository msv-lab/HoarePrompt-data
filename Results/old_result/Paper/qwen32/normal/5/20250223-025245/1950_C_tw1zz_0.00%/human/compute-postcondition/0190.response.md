Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `s`. If `h` is `'10'`, `h1` is `'10'` and `time` is `'AM'`. If `h` is `'11'`, `h1` is `'11'` and `time` is `'AM'`. If `h` is `'12'`, `h1` is `'12'` and `time` is `'AM'`. If `h` is `'13'`, `h1` is `'01'` and `time` is `'PM'`. If `h` is `'14'`, `h1` is `'02'` and `time` is `'PM'`. If `h` is any other value between `'15'` and `'23'`, `h1` is the corresponding hour in 12-hour format with `'PM'` as `time`. If `h` is `'00'`, `h1` is `'12'` and `time` is `'PM'`. Otherwise, `h1` and `time` remain empty strings.**
