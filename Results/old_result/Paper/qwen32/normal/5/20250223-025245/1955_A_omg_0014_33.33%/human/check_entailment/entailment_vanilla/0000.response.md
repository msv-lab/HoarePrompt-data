Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts where:
- The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The cost of two yogurts under promotion is `b` burles.

The goal is to determine the minimum cost based on these prices.

### Program Analysis

Let's walk through the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Variable Mapping**: 
   - The program reads `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`, but according to the problem statement, the correct variables should be `(n, a, b)`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts under promotion.
   - Therefore, the correct line should be `(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d = c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the context of the problem. The correct variable to use here should be `b` (the price for two yogurts).
   - Therefore, the correct line should be `d = b / 2`.
   - However, `d` is not the correct approach. Instead, we should calculate the number of pairs of two yogurts and the remaining single yogurt separately.

3. **Incorrect Conditional Logic**:
   - The conditional logic `if a * b < a * d` does not make sense in this context. Instead, we need to compare the cost of buying yogurts in pairs versus buying them individually.
   - The logic should be to calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then add the cost of the remaining single yogurt if necessary.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly:
- Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought: `num_pairs = n // 2`.
- Calculate the number of single yogurts that will be bought: `num_singles = n % 2`.
- Calculate the total cost: `total_cost = num_pairs * b + num_singles * a`.

### Correct Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        num_pairs = n // 2
        num_singles = n % 2
        total_cost = num_pairs * b + num_singles * a
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to incorrect variable mapping, calculation, and conditional logic.

**Correctness: False**
