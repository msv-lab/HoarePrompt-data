You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, calculates `d` as `c / 2`, and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on the condition `a * b < a * d`. The function processes each test case independently and outputs a result for each one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

The program reads `n` test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers: `a` (number of yogurts), `b` (price for one yogurt), and `c` (price for two yogurts on promotion). The program then calculates `d` as `c / 2` (which is not used correctly), and it checks if `a * b < a * d`. This comparison does not make sense in the context of the problem.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is not used correctly in the comparison. Instead, `d` should be used to determine how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The comparison `a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many yogurts are left to be bought at the regular price.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The program outputs `a * b` or `round(a * d)`, which is not the correct minimum cost. The correct minimum cost should be calculated based on the number of pairs of yogurts bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts bought at the regular price.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the number of yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price
        remaining = n % 2
        # Calculate the total cost
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum cost by determining how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many yogurts are left to be bought at the regular price.
