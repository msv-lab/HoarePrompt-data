Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

The program reads `n` test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers: `a` (number of yogurts), `b` (price for one yogurt), and `c` (price for two yogurts on promotion). The program then calculates `d` as `c / 2` (which is not used correctly), and it checks if `a * b < a * d`. This comparison does not make sense in the context of the problem.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is not used correctly in the comparison. Instead, `d` should be used to determine how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The comparison `a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many yogurts are left to be bought at the regular price.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The program outputs `a * b` or `round(a * d)`, which is not the correct minimum cost. The correct minimum cost should be calculated based on the number of pairs of yogurts bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts bought at the regular price.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the number of yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price
        remaining = n % 2
        # Calculate the total cost
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum cost by determining how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many yogurts are left to be bought at the regular price.
