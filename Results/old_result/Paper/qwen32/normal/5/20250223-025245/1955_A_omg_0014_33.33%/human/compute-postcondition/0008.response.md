Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input, `d` is `c / 2`. If `a * b < a * d`, then `a * b` is less than `a * d`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a * b < a * d`.**
