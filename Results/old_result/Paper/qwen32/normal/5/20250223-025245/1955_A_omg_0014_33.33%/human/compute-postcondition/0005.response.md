Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their constraints:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers derived from the input.
   - `d` is defined as `c / 2`.
   - The condition `a * b < a * d` is given.

2. **Expression to be printed:**
   - The print statement is `print(a * b)`, so we need to determine the value of `a * b`.

3. **Analyzing the condition:**
   - The condition `a * b < a * d` can be rewritten using the definition of `d`:
     - `a * b < a * (c / 2)`
     - This simplifies to `a * b < a * c / 2`
     - If `a` is not zero, we can divide both sides by `a`:
       - `b < c / 2`
       - This implies that `b` is less than half of `c`.

4. **Determining the output:**
   - The output will be the value of `a * b`.
   - Since `a` and `b` are integers derived from the input, and `b < c / 2`, the exact numerical value of `a * b` cannot be determined without the specific values of `a` and `b`.
   - However, we know that `a * b` is a product of two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is less than half of `c`.

Given the constraints and the condition, the output will be the product of `a` and `b` as specified in the initial state.

Output: **a * b (where a and b are integers such that b < c / 2)**
