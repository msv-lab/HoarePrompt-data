The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state specifies the ranges for `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. After the code execution, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the first two integers from the input, and `c` is assigned the third integer from the input. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input.**
