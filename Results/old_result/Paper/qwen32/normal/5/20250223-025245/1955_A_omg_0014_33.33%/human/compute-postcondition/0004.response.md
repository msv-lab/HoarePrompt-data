Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `c` is the third integer from the input, `d` is `c / 2`, and `a * b < a * d`. The current value of `d` is half of `c`, and `a * b` is less than `a * d`.**
