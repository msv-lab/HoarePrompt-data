The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. This changes the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the input, but the values of `t`, `n`, `d`, and the condition `a * b < a * d` are not updated by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`. If `a * b < a * d`, then `a * b` is less than `a * d`. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a * b < a * d`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
