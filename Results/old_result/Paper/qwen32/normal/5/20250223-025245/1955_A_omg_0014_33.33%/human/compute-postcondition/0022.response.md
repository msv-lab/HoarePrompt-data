The function `func` accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the function receives three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints are that `1 <= t <= 10^4` and for each test case, `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.
