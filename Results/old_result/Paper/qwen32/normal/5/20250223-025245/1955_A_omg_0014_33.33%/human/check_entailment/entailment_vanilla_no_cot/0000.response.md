Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a` is the number of yogurts, `b` is the price for one yogurt, and `c` is the price for two yogurts on promotion.
3. It then calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is not used correctly.
4. The program then checks if `a * b < a * d`. This condition is incorrect because:
   - `a * b` is the cost if Maxim buys all yogurts individually.
   - `a * d` is not a valid calculation for the cost when buying in pairs. The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying all yogurts individually (`a * b`) and the cost of buying as many pairs as possible plus any remaining single yogurt.
5. The program prints `a * b` if the condition is true, otherwise it prints `round(a * d)`, which is incorrect as explained.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought with the promotion price (`n // 2`).
- Calculate the cost for these pairs (`pairs * c`).
- Calculate how many yogurts are left after buying pairs (`n % 2`).
- Add the cost of the remaining yogurts (`remaining * b`).
- Print the total cost.

Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * c + remaining * b
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected version will give the correct minimum cost for each test case.
