The code snippet sets `s` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`start` is the first input integer minus 1, `end` is the second input integer minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is unchanged, `d2` contains accumulated `s` values, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1.**
