The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (which we don't know specifically, but it is less than `m` for the loop to have executed), and `m` is greater than `0`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1.

State: **`start` is the first integer from input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` is greater than `0`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged. If `start < end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can denote the new state of `i` as `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. However, for the sake of the template, we can simply state that `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`start` is the first integer from input minus 1, `end` is the second integer from input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration, `d1` remains unchanged, `d2` has entries for each `start` position from `len(lst) - 1` to `1`, `m` is greater than `0`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged.**
