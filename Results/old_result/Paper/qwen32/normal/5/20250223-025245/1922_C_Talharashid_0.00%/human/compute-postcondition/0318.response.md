The code snippet `d2[start] = s` assigns the value of `s` to the key `start` in the dictionary `d2`. 

The variables `i`, `end`, `inc`, `d1`, `lst`, `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `mini` also remains unchanged unless it was updated in the previous conditional logic, but that is not part of the given code snippet. The variable `start` and `s` are used to update `d2`.

Output State: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `start + inc`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` is updated with `d2[start] = s`; `mini` is `min(mini, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains `11111111`; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
