Output State: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `0`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` has keys from `len(lst) - 2` to `0` with corresponding `s` values; `mini` holds the minimum absolute difference calculated during the last iteration; `s` is the cumulative sum of the absolute differences or increments; `lst` remains unchanged; `m` is an input integer; `t` and `n` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the only change is that `m` is now assigned the value of an integer input by the user. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
