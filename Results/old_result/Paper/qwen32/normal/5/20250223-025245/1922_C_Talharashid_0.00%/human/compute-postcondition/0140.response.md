Postcondition: **`start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0, `mini` is `min(11111111, abs(lst[0] - lst[1]))` if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains 11111111, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input with more than one element.**
