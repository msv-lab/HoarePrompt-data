The value of `end` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Since `end` was initially the second integer from the input minus 1, after the decrement, `end` becomes the second integer from the input minus 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 2, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `s` is 0. If the first integer from the input is less than the second integer from the input, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
