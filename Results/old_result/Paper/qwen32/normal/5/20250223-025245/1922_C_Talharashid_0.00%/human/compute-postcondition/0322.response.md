Postcondition: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `1`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` is updated with `d2[start] = s`; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[1] - lst[2])` and `11111111` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains `11111111`; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
