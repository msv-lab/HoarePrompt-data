Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is either 0 or 1 plus `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `mini` is the minimum of `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`, and `d2[start]` is `s`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `s` is updated to its previous value plus the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. The values of `start`, `end`, `inc`, `mini`, `d1`, and `d2[start]` remain as given in the initial state, except for `s` and `d2[start]` which now reflect the updated value of `s`.
