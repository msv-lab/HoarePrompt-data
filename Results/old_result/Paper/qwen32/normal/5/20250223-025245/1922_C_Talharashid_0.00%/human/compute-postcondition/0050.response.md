Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `s` is the accumulated sum of absolute differences as calculated by the loop; `mini` is the minimum difference found in the last iteration; `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`.**

In natural language: The value of `inc` has been changed to -1. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `s`, `mini`, and `d1`) remain unchanged.
