The only variable in the loop head is `start` and `end`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `start` and `end`. If `start` is not equal to `end`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `end` is `0` and `start` is `start + inc`, where `inc` is `-1`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `start` should not be equal to `end`. Since `inc` is `-1`, `start` should be `1` (or any positive value) at the end of the previous iteration to make sure `start` is not equal to `end` (which is `0`).

So, we need to adjust `start` to be `1` (or any positive value) at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` must be `1`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` is updated with `d2[start] = s`; `mini` is `min(mini, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains `11111111`; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
