Postcondition: **`i` remains `m + 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `d1` has keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding `s` values; `d2` remains a defaultdict with default int value of `0`; `mini` is `min(11111111, abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]))` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, otherwise `mini` remains `11111111`; `s` is `0`; `lst` remains unchanged; `m`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
