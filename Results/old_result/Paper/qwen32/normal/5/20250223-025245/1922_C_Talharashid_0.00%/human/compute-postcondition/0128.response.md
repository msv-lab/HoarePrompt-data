The code snippet provided initializes `d1` as a `defaultdict` with `int` as the default factory. This means `d1` will now be a dictionary that returns `0` for any key that does not exist in the dictionary.

Output State: **`start` is the first input integer of the last iteration minus 1, `end` is the second input integer of the last iteration minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `d2` contains accumulated `s` values, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`.**
