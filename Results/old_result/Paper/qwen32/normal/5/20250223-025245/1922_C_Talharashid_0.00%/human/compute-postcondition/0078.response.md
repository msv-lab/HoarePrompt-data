The `while` loop condition is `start != end`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `start` and `end` such that `start` is not equal to `end`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 4`
- `end` is `0`

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end`. Since `end` is `0`, we can adjust `start` to be any value other than `0`. 

However, considering the context of the loop and the provided state, a logical adjustment would be to decrement `start` by `inc` (which is `-1`), as this seems to be the intended behavior based on the loop's logic.

Adjusting `start` to `start - inc` (which is `len(lst) - 4 - (-1) = len(lst) - 3`), we get:

State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `mini` is the minimum of `mini` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged, `s` remains either 0 or 1 plus `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` and values representing the accumulated `s` at each `start`, `d2[start]` is `s`**
