The code snippet provided initializes a variable `start` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `d1`, `d2`, `lst`) are modified by this code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Given the initial state, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ `a_1` < `a_2` < ... < `a_n` ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x_i`, `y_i` ≤ `n` and `x_i` ≠ `y_i`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `start` is 0.**
