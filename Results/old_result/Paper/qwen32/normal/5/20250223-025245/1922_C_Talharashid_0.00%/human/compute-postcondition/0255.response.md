Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `start` and `end` are the values from the last iteration, `s` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `mini` is unchanged, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int value of 0, `m`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` are unchanged.**

Natural Language: The value of `d2` has been reset to a new defaultdict with default integer values of 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
