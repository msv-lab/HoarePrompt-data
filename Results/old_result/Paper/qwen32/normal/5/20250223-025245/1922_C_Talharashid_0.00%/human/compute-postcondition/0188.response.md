Postcondition: **`start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is `0`, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, and `lst` is a list of integers from the input. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`**
