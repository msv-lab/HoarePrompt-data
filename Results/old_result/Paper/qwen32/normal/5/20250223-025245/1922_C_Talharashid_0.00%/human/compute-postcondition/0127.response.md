The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since `inc` is -1, but it does not affect the loop condition directly, only the loop body). However, the loop condition is based on `i` being less than `t`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `t` for the loop to continue.

Given that `i` is currently equal to `m`, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be `m + 1` and `t` should be greater than `m + 1`.

State: **`start` is the first input integer of the last iteration minus 1, `end` is the second input integer of the last iteration minus 1, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum difference in the last iteration, `d1` is unchanged, `d2` contains accumulated `s` values, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`**
