The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is `0`, `inc` is `-1`, `s` is `1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with keys from `1` to `len(lst) - 1` and corresponding values of `0`, `d2` is a defaultdict with int as the default factory, `m` is the same as the input integer, `i` is equal to `m + 1`, `t` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`**.
