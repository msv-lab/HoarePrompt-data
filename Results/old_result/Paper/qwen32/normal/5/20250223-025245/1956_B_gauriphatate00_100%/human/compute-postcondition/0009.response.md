The code snippet `count_a[num] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `num` in the dictionary `count_a`. This means that the entry for `num` in `count_a` is now set to `1`. The values of `a` and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `num` is the next integer in the list `a` after the previously processed one, `count_a[num]` is 1**.
