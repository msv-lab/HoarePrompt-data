To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it updates the `max_score` based on the `count_a` dictionary.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we see that:
- The loop iterates from `num = 1` to `num = n`.
- For each `num` in this range, if `num` is a key in `count_a` and its value is 2, `max_score` is incremented by 1.
- `count_a` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `n` is the upper limit of the loop and must be greater than 0.

The loop will iterate `n` times, checking each number from 1 to `n` to see if it is in `count_a` and if its count is 2. If so, it increments `max_score`.

Therefore, the final `max_score` will be the total number of unique integers in `count_a` that have a count of 2.

**Output State: **`count_a` remains the same as the initial state, and `max_score` is the total number of unique integers in `count_a` that have a count of 2.**

In simpler terms, `max_score` will be the count of numbers that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.
