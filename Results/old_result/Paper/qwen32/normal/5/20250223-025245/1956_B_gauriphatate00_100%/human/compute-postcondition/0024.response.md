The code snippet `max_score += 1` increments the value of `max_score` by 1. The initial state specifies that `max_score` is either 0 or 1, depending on the conditions related to `count_a` and `num`. After the increment, if `max_score` was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 2. The other variables (`count_a`, `n`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a`, then the initial value of `max_score` was 1 if `count_a[num]` is 2, otherwise `max_score` was 0. `n` is greater than 0. `num` is the value from the previous iteration incremented by 1. `max_score` is incremented by 1.**
