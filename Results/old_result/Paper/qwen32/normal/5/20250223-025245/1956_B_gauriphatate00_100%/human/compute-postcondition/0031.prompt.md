Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`; `max_score` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in range(1, n + 1):
    if num in count_a:
        if count_a[num] == 2:
            max_score += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a`, then `max_score` is 1 if `count_a[num]` is 2, otherwise `max_score` remains 0. `n` is greater than 0. If `num` is not in `count_a`, `max_score` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `n` is greater than 0. `num` is the value from the previous iteration incremented by 1. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is 2, then `max_score` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `max_score` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. `n` is greater than 0. `num` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `num` is a key in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, then `max_score` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `max_score` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
