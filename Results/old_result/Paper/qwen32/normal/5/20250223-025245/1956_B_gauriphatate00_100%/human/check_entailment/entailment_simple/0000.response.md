### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally. The key point to consider is that Nene's strategy is to maximize her score and minimize yours. 

The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of points you can get based on the initial distribution of cards. It does this by counting the occurrences of each card in your hand and then calculating how many pairs of cards (where each pair consists of the same integer) you have. Each pair can potentially give you one point if Nene hasn't already placed a card of that integer on the table.

However, the function `func_1` does not account for the strategic play by Nene. It simply counts the pairs you have and assumes that you will always get one point for each pair, which is not necessarily true given Nene's optimal play. Nene will try to prevent you from scoring points whenever possible.

For example, if you have two cards with the number `1`, and Nene has the other two cards with the number `1`, Nene can play one of her `1` cards before you can play yours, thus preventing you from scoring a point for that pair. 

Therefore, the function `func_1` does not correctly account for the strategic interactions between you and Nene, and it does not provide the correct maximum number of points you can get under optimal play by both players.
