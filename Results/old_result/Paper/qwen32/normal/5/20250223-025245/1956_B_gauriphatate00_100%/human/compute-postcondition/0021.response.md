Postcondition: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `count_a[num]` is 2, then `max_score` is 1; otherwise, `max_score` remains 0. `n` is greater than 0 and `num` is in `count_a`.**
