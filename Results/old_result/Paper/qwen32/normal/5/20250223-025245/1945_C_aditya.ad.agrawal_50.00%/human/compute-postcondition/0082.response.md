The code snippet provided is `z_l += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `z_l` by 1. The other variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `i`, `pos`) are not affected by this operation.

Given that `z_l` is incremented, the output state will reflect this change. The other variables retain their initial states as described.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with at least one integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` with at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1, `z_l` is incremented by 1.**
