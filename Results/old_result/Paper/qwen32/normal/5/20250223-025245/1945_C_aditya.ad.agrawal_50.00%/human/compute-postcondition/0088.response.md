The code calculates `b_d` as the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`. No other variables are modified in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is an input string that can be converted to a list with at least one integer, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` with at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`**.
