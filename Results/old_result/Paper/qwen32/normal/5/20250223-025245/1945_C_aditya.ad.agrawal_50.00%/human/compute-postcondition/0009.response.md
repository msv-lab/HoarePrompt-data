The code snippet initializes `z_l` to 0. No other variables are affected. The values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, and `o_r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting a character from `input_string` to an integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 0.**
