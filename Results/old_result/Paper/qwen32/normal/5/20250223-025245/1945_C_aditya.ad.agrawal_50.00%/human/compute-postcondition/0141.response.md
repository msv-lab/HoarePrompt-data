Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least two elements, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 1 if `i` was 0, otherwise `z_l` is 2, `o_l` is 2 if `i` was 0, otherwise `o_l` is 1, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr` minus 2, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr` minus 2, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is 3, `i` is the next element in `arr`.**

The value of `pos` is incremented by 1, so `pos` is now 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
