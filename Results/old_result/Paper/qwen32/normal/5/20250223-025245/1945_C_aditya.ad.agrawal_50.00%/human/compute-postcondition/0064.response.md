Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is updated to the input string; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 0; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`;**

The value of `b_d` has been updated to be equal to `dist`, which is `abs(n / 2)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
