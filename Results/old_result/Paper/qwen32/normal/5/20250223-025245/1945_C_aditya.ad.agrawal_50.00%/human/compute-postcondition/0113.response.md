The code snippet reassigns values to `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`. Given that `n` is the new input integer, `dist` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2)`. The variables `ans` and `pos` are both set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the new input integer, `input_string` is the new input string, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `b_d` is the minimum distance to the midpoint where the conditions are met.**
