The code snippet converts each character in `input_string` to an integer and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `input_string` remain unchanged, while `arr` is newly created.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting a character from `input_string` to an integer.**
