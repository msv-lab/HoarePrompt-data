Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is the result of converting a character from `input_string` to an integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is equal to `o`.**

In this output state, the value of `o_r` has been set to the value of `o`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
