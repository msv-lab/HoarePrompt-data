Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is an input string with at least one character; `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one integer; `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`; `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`. `i` is the next element in `arr`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1. `pos` is increased by 1; `o_r`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `dist`, `b_d`, and `ans` remain as per their definitions based on the new value of `i`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is equal to `pos` and `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, `ans` and `b_d` remain as per their previous definitions.**
