To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means that the only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace
- `input` holds the entire input string
- `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`
- `T` is an integer value greater than 0
- `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`
- `n` must be at least 2
- `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`
- `last_year` is equal to `next_year`
- `i` is `n`
- `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n]) // a[n] * a[n]`

The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start with `i` equal to 1 and will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since the loop has just ended, the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration was `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to the starting value of the loop, which is 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` set to 1. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted because it defines the upper limit of the loop and has not changed.

State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `i` is 1, `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n]) // a[n] * a[n]`**
