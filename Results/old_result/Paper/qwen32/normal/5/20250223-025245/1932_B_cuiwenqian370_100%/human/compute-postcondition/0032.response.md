The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Since the loop is currently running with `i` starting from 1, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2, and `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is an integer value greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `i` is 2; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.**
