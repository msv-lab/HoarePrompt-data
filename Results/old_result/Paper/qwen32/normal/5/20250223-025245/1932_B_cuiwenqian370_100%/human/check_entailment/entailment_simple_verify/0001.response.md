Reasoning: The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and reasoning. Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure everything aligns with the problem description and the annotations.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` to `a[0]`, which is the first sign's periodicity.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year the sign can occur using the formula:
     ```
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the formula:
     - `last_year + 1` ensures that we are looking for the next occurrence after `last_year`.
     - `a[i] - 1` is added to ensure that we round up to the next multiple of `a[i]`.
     - The entire expression `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` effectively calculates the ceiling of `(last_year + 1) / a[i]` and multiplies it by `a[i]` to get the next multiple.

3. **Updating the Last Year:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results for each test case.

The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code describe the state of the program accurately and confirm the logic used for calculating the next year for each sign. The formula used is correct and ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur by ensuring each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The formula used to calculate the next occurrence of each sign is correct, and the program handles multiple test cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
