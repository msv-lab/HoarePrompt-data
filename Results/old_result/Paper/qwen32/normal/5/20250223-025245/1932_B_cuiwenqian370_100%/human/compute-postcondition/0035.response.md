The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is an integer value greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `i` is 3; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2]`.**
