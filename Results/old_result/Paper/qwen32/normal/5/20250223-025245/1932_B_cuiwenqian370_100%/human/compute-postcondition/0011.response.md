The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `last_year`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `last_year` is `a[0]`.**
