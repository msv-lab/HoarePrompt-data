### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the function summary to ensure that the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
The Chaya tribe has `n` signs of the apocalypse, each occurring periodically every `a_i` years. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning the `i+1`-th sign can only occur after the `i`-th sign. The task is to determine in which year the `n`-th sign will occur.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates the year in which each sign occurs sequentially. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs on the next multiple of `a[i]` after `last_year + 1`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it stores the year of the `n`-th sign in the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints all results.

#### Correctness Verification:
Let's verify if the program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

- **Single Sign (n=1):**
  - If there is only one sign, the year of the apocalypse is simply `a[0]`.
  - The program correctly handles this case since `last_year` is initialized to `a[0]`.

- **Multiple Signs:**
  - For multiple signs, the program correctly calculates the year of each sign based on the previous sign's occurrence.
  - The formula used ensures that each sign occurs on the next multiple of its periodicity after the previous sign.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `a = [1, 1, 1]`), the program correctly calculates the year as `n` (since each sign occurs every year).
  - If the periodicities are different, the program correctly calculates the year based on the sequential occurrences.

#### Formula Analysis:
The formula used to calculate `next_year` is:
\[
\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
\]
This can be simplified to:
\[
\text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + a[i]}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
\]
This formula effectively computes the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `6, 3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Calculation:
    - `last_year = 3`
    - `next_year = (3 + 2) // 2 * 2 = 4`
    - `next_year = (4 + 4) // 4 * 4 = 8`
    - `next_year = (8 + 5) // 5 * 5 = 10`
    - `next_year = (10 + 9) // 9 * 9 = 18`
    - `next_year = (18 + 18) // 18 * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36` (correct)

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `5, 1 2 3 4 5`
  - Calculation:
    - `last_year = 1`
    - `next_year = (1 + 2) // 2 * 2 = 2`
    - `next_year = (2 + 3) // 3 * 3 = 3`
    - `next_year = (3 + 4) // 4 * 4 = 4`
    - `next_year = (4 + 5) // 5 * 5 = 5`
  - Output: `5` (correct)

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `5, 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Calculation:
    - `last_year = 1`
    - `next_year = (1 + 1) // 1 * 1 = 2`
    - `next_year = (2 + 1) // 1 * 1 = 3`
    - `next_year = (3 + 1) // 1 * 1 = 4`
    - `next_year = (4 + 1) // 1 * 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5` (correct)

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - Input: `6, 50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Calculation:
    - `last_year = 50`
    - `next_year = (50 + 30) // 30 * 30 = 60`
    - `next_year = (60 + 711) // 711 * 711 = 771`
    - `next_year = (771 + 200) // 200 * 200 = 900`
    - `next_year = (900 + 503) // 503 * 503 = 1006`
    - `next_year = (1006 + 1006) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012` (correct)

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and edge cases.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all described scenarios, including edge cases. It follows the problem description accurately and calculates the year of the `n`-th sign correctly for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
