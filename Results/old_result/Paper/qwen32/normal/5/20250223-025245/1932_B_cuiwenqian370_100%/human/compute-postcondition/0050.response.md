The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n-1 + 1`, which is `n`.

State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `i` is `n`, `next_year` is `((last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`**.
