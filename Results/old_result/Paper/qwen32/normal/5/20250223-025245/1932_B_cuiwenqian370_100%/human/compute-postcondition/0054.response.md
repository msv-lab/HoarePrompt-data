The given code snippet modifies the value of `next_year`. Let's break down the changes:

Initial State:
- `data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace
- `input` holds the entire input string
- `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`
- `T` is an integer value greater than 0
- `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`
- `n` must be at least 2
- `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`
- `last_year` is equal to `next_year`
- `i` is 1
- `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n]) // a[n] * a[n]`

The code snippet:
```python
next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
```

This simplifies to:
```python
next_year = (last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]
```

Since `last_year` is equal to `next_year` before this line, the new value of `next_year` is:
```python
next_year = (next_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]
```

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `i` is 1, `next_year` is `(next_year + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`.**

In natural language, the only change is that `next_year` is now calculated as `(next_year + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`, while all other variables retain their initial state.
