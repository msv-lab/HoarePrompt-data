Given the initial state and the code snippet, we can determine the output state as follows:

The code modifies the value of `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Simplifying the formula, we get `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.

Since `i` is `n`, and `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `a[i]` is the same as `a[n]`.

Thus, the new value of `next_year` becomes `(last_year + a[n]) // a[n] * a[n]`.

The other variables remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace, `input` holds the entire input string, `index` is `index + 2*n + 1`, `T` is an integer value greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` and `last_year`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + a[n-1]) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `i` is `n`, `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n]) // a[n] * a[n]`**.
