Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing all the input values split by whitespace; `input` holds the entire input string; `index` is `index + n`; `T` is an integer value greater than 0 and is decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is the final calculated year after all iterations; `i` is `n - 1`; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, so it now points to the position right after the last element of the list `a`. All other variables retain their previous values.
