The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which iterates over the elements of the list `arr`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `num` and how it relates to the list `arr`.

Given that the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, the state at the start of the next iteration will involve `num` taking on the value of the next element in the list. The other variables (`arr`, `k`, and `frequency_table`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.

Since `num` is the only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in the list `arr`.

Assuming the current value of `num` is the `i`-th element of `arr`, the next value of `num` will be the `(i+1)`-th element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and has at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key. If `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then the value of `frequency_table[num]` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged, `num` is the next element in `arr`**.
