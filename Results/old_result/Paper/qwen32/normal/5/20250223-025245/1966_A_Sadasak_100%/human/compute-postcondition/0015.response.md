Output State: **The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from the list `arr` and each value is the minimum of the count of that number in `arr` and `k`.**

This means that for each unique number in the list `arr`, the dictionary `frequency_table` will have that number as a key, and the value will be the lesser of how many times that number appears in `arr` and the integer `k`.
