Reasoning: 
The provided code does not correctly compute the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. The logic in `func_1` and the main loop is flawed.

1. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number in the list `arr` but incorrectly caps the frequency at `k`. This does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left. The frequency should be used to determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed and how many cards will remain after these operations.

2. **Decision Making**: The main loop uses the result from `func_1` to determine the output, but it does so incorrectly. It checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table, which is not a valid condition to determine the minimum number of cards left.

3. **Logic for Minimum Cards**: The correct approach involves calculating the remainder of the division of each frequency by `k` (i.e., `freq % k`), summing these remainders, and ensuring that the final result is at least 1 (since no operations can reduce the number of cards to 0 if there are any cards left).

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
