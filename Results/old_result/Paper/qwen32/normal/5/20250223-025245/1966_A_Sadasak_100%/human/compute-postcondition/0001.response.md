The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is used to iterate over the elements in the list `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element. The state of `k` and `frequency_table` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so we do not need to adjust them for the loop to start executing.

Given the constraints:
- `1 <= len(arr) <= 100`
- `2 <= k <= 100`
- `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary

We only need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards and must have at least 1 element, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**
