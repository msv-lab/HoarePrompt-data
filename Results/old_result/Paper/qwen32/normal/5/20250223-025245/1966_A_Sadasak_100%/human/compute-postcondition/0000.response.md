The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. This dictionary is intended to store the frequency of each integer in the list `arr`. The other variables, `arr` and `k`, are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and `k` is an integer representing the number of cards to exchange in each operation such that 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**
