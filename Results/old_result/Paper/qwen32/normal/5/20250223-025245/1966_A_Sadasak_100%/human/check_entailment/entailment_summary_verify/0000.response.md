### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect based on the problem description and the function summary:

1. **Incorrect Frequency Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to limit the frequency of each card to `k`. This is incorrect because the frequency of each card should be counted accurately without any upper limit. The logic in `func_1` does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values and then prints `k - 1` or `n` based on that condition. This is flawed. The correct approach is to calculate the remaining cards after performing the allowed exchanges. Specifically, for each unique card number, the program should:
     - Calculate how many times it can perform the exchange operation (`freq // k`).
     - Determine the remaining cards (`freq % k + 1` if `freq % k != 0`).

3. **Missing Core Logic**:
   - The core logic to minimize the number of cards is missing in the provided program. The corrected version of the program accurately counts the frequency of each card, calculates the number of exchanges possible, and determines the minimum number of cards left after all possible exchanges.

### Corrected Version:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += count // k
        if count % k != 0:
            min_cards += 1
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. The corrected version of the program accurately counts the frequency of each card, calculates the number of exchanges possible, and determines the minimum number of cards left after all possible exchanges.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
