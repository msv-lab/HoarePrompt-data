#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the stick lengths.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, and `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the second to the `t+1`-th element of `arr`, and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in those positions.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers where the first element represents the number of test cases, and the subsequent elements represent stick lengths. It calculates the sum of how many complete sets of three can be formed from each unique stick length and returns this sum.
