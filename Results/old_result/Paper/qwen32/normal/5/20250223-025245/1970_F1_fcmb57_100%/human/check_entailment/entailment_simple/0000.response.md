### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization of the Field and Entities:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field `N` and `M`.
   - It initializes dictionaries for `players` and `goals` and a dictionary for `mouvements` that maps direction characters to coordinate changes.
   - It initializes the scores for both teams (`pointsb` for blue and `pointsr` for red) to 0.
   - It then iterates through the field to populate the `players` and `goals` dictionaries, correctly identifying the positions of players and goals.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of moves `T`.
   - For each move, it splits the input into a list `mo`.
   - If the action is a movement (`'U'`, `'D'`, `'L'`, `'R'`), it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
   - If the action is a throw (`'T'`), it checks if the player's current position is in the opposing team's goal and updates the score accordingly, printing the appropriate message.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly updates the player's position based on the direction provided. It takes the current position `(x, y)` and a movement `(dx, dy)`, and returns the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
   - The comment in the code states that the function returns a tuple with concatenated strings, which is incorrect. The function actually returns a tuple of integers representing the new coordinates.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the score events and the final score as required.

### Issues Identified:
- The comment for `func_1` is incorrect. It states that the function returns a tuple of concatenated strings, but it actually returns a tuple of integers.
- The code does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. Instead of checking if the player's position is in the opposing team's goal, it should check if the player's position is in the opposing team's goal and if it is not in their own goal.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not fully meet the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: False**
