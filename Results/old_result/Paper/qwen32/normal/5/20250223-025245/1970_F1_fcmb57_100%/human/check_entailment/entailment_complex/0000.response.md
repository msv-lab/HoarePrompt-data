Reasoning:  
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem. Here are the main issues:

1. **Incorrect `func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the new coordinates of a player after a movement. However, the current implementation concatenates the string representations of the coordinates instead of adding the numerical values. This will result in incorrect coordinate updates.

2. **Incorrect Goal Checking**: The program checks if the player's position is in the list of goals. However, it does not handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal, which should result in a point for the opposing team.

3. **Incorrect Movement Handling**: The program does not correctly update the Quaffle's position when a player catches or throws it. The Quaffle should move to the player's position when caught and return to the center of the field when thrown.

4. **Incorrect Goal Scoring Logic**: The program does not handle the case where the Quaffle is thrown into a goal. It only checks the player's position, which is incorrect because the Quaffle's position is the one that determines if a goal is scored.

5. **Incorrect Output Format**: The program does not correctly format the output for goal events and the final score.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle = None

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quaffle = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[0] == '.Q':
        if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
            quaffle = (quaffle[0] + mouvements[mo[1]][0], quaffle[1] + mouvements[mo[1]][1])
    elif mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = (players[mo[0]][0] + mouvements[mo[1]][0], players[mo[0]][1] + mouvements[mo[1]][1])
        if quaffle == players[mo[0]]:
            quaffle = players[mo[0]]
    elif mo[1] == 'C' and mo[2] == '.Q' and quaffle == players[mo[0]]:
        quaffle = players[mo[0]]
    elif mo[1] == 'T' and quaffle == players[mo[0]]:
        if quaffle in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        elif quaffle in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        elif quaffle in goals['B'] and mo[0].startswith('R'):
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
        elif quaffle in goals['R'] and mo[0].startswith('B'):
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        quaffle = ((m + 1) // 2 - 1, (n + 1) // 2 - 1)

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
