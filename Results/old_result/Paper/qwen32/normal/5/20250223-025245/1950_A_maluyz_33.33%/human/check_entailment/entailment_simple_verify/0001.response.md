Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if three digits form a "STAIR" (a < b < c), "PEAK" (a < b > c), or "NONE" (neither).

### Program Code Recap:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Annotations Recap:
The annotations describe the program's state at key points:
- The program reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if true.
- It checks if `a == b == c` and prints "NONE" if true.
- It checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` and prints "PEAK" if true.
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

### Evaluation of the Program:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - **Condition for "STAIR":** The program checks if `a < b < c`. This is correct because it correctly identifies a stair.
   - **Redundant Condition for "NONE":** The program checks if `a == b == c` and prints "NONE". This condition is indeed unnecessary. If `a == b == c`, the program will correctly fall into the "NONE" else clause because neither `a < b < c` nor `max(a, b, c) == b` will be true. However, the presence of this condition does not affect the correctness of the program; it just adds an unnecessary check.
   - **Condition for "PEAK":** The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b`. This is correct for identifying a peak, as it ensures that `b` is the largest number and `a < b > c`.
   - **Default Case:** If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE". This is correct because it handles all other cases where neither a stair nor a peak is formed.

### Conclusion:
The program is functionally correct despite the unnecessary condition `elif a == b == c:`. The presence of this condition does not affect the correctness of the output for any valid input.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
