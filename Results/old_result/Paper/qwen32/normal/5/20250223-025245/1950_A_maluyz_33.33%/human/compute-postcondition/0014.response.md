Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input. It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. If `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `c`, then all three variables are equal. Otherwise, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, and if `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`, then `b` is the maximum value; otherwise, the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`.**
