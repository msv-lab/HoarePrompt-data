Given the initial state, we know that `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided by the user input, with the condition that `a < b < c`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('STAIR')
```

This statement directly prints the string 'STAIR' without referencing any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Therefore, the output will simply be the string 'STAIR'.

Output: **STAIR**
