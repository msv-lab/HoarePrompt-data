The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`. The values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are described in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on these variables.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. The variable `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
2. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input, with the condition that `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `c`.
3. The `print` statement outputs the string `'NONE'`.

Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output `'NONE'`, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not influence the output.

Output: **NONE**
