Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` equals `b` equals `c`, the program behaves as described in the if part. Otherwise, regardless of whether `max(a, b, c) == b` is true or false, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the increment of `i` remain unchanged.**
