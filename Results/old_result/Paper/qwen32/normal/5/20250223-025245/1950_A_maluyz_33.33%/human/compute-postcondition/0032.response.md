Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is incremented by 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, separated by spaces. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, the if block executes. Otherwise, the else block executes. In both cases, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as initially described.**
