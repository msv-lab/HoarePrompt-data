Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('NONE')` statement directly prints the string `'NONE'`. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
Since the `print` statement explicitly outputs the string `'NONE'`, the output will be:

Output: **NONE**
