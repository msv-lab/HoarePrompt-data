To determine what will be printed by the `print('PEAK')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

However, none of these variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`) are used in the `print('PEAK')` statement. The statement simply prints the string 'PEAK' as it is.

Therefore, the output will be the string 'PEAK' without any modification or influence from the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`.

Output: **PEAK**
