Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 1000; `i` is incremented by 1; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, separated by spaces. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, the condition `a < b < c` holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, but the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
