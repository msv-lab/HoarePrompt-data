Postcondition: **`t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the user input. If `a < b < c`, then the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then `a = b = c`. If they are not all equal, and `b` is the maximum among `a`, `b`, and `c`, then `b` is the maximum value; otherwise, the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`.**
