The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input. This integer represents the number of test cases, and it is specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case are not affected by this input statement because they are not mentioned in the code snippet. Therefore, the only variable that changes is `t`, which is assigned the value of the input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.**
