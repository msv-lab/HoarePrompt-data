Output State: **`input` is assigned the entire input data as a single string; `data` is a list of strings where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent elements are the integers `n` and strings `s` for each test case, all as strings; `t` must be greater than 1 and will be decremented by 1; `index` is 7; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`; `s` is `data[6]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[6]`.**

Explanation: The variable `count_u` is updated to be the number of occurrences of the character 'U' in the string `s`, which is `data[6]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
