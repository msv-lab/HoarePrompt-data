Reasoning:
The problem revolves around determining the winner of a game based on the number of "U" (facing up) coins in a circular arrangement. The key insight is that the game's outcome can be determined by the parity (odd or even) of the count of "U" coins. If the count of "U" coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win.

The provided program reads multiple test cases, counts the number of "U" coins for each test case, and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if the count is even. This aligns with the problem's requirement based on the game's rules and optimal play strategies.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the count of "U" coins. The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the program, further supporting its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
