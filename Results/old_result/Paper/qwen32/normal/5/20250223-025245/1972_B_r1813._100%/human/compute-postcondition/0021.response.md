Postcondition: **`input` is assigned the entire input data as a single string; `data` is a list of strings where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent elements are the integers `n` and strings `s` for each test case, all as strings; `t` must be greater than 0 and decremented by 1; `index` is 5; `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`; `s` is `data[4]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. Regardless of whether `count_u` is odd or even, the state of `input`, `data`, `t`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes that the if-else block does not alter the values of the variables `input`, `data`, `t`, `index`, `n`, `s`, or `count_u` based on the condition `count_u % 2 == 1`.
