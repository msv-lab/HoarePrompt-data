The code snippet `s = data[index + 1]` assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `s`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `s` will be assigned the value of `data[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`input` is assigned the entire input data as a single string; `data` is a list of strings where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent elements are the integers `n` and strings `s` for each test case, all as strings; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `s` is `data[2]`.**
