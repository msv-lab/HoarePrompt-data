Postcondition: **`input` is assigned the entire input data as a single string; `data` is a list of strings where the first element is the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent elements are the integers `n` and strings `s` for each test case, all as strings; `t` is greater than 1 and will be decremented by 1; `index` is 7; `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`; `s` is `data[6]`; `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `data[6]`. The value of `count_u` determines whether the code executes the if block or the else block, but the state of all variables remains unchanged after the execution of either block.**
