The provided code snippet only reads the input from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `input`. It does not process or modify any other variables or perform any operations on the input data. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the `input` variable, which now holds the entire input data as a single string.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. `input` is assigned the entire input data as a single string.**
