Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up ('U') coins. The key insight is that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win, and if it is even, Bob will always win. This is because each move flips two coins, effectively changing the parity of the number of facing-up coins, and the player who faces an odd number of facing-up coins can always make a move, while the player who faces an even number will eventually be unable to make a move. The program counts the number of 'U's in the string and checks if this count is odd or even to determine the winner.
