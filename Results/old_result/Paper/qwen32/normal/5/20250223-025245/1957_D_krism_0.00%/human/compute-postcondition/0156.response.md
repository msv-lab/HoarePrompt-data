To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes, we need to understand the context and the calculations involved in the given initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization and Definitions:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100,000.
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `arr_i` is between 1 and 1,000,000,000.
   - `prefix` is a list with `n+1` elements. The first element is 0, and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`.
   - `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers. These integers are updated based on the bits of all `prefix[i]` values.
   - `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers. These integers are updated based on the bits of all `prefix[i]` values.
   - `i` is set to `n + 1`.
   - `cur` is set to `prefix[0]`, which is 0.
   - `j` is set to 32.
   - `ans` is the accumulated sum of products of the counts of 0s and 1s in the `pre` and `suf` lists for each relevant bit position.

2. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is calculated by iterating over each bit position from 0 to 31 (since integers are typically represented using 32 bits).
   - For each bit position `k` (0 <= k <= 31), the value of `ans` is updated by adding the product of the counts of 0s and 1s in the `pre` and `suf` lists for that bit position.
   - Specifically, `ans` is incremented by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed.

Given the problem's context, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without the specific values of `arr` and the subsequent computations of `prefix`, `pre`, and `suf`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated sum of products of the counts of 0s and 1s in the `pre` and `suf` lists for each relevant bit position)**
