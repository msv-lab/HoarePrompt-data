Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except each `pre[i][0]` for i in range(32) which is 1, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers where `suf[j][1]` is the number of times the `j`-th bit was `1` across all `prefix[i]` values from `prefix[n]` to `prefix[1]` minus 1 for `j`-th bit of `prefix[1]`, and `suf[j][0]` is the number of times the `j`-th bit was `0` across all those values, `i` is 1, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 1, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[1]`. `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the `suf[j][1]` value has been decremented by 1, reflecting that the `j`-th bit of `prefix[1]` has been removed from the count of `1`s in the suffix list for that bit position. All other variables remain unchanged.
