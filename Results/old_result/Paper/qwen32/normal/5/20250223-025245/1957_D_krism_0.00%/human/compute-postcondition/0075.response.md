To determine the output of the `print(suf)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the `suf` list is constructed.

### Initial State Breakdown
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly used in the provided snippet.
2. **`n`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
3. **`arr`**: A list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies \(1 \leq arr_i \leq 10^9\).
4. **`prefix`**: A list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`.
5. **`pre`**: A list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros except each `pre[i][0]` for `i` in range(32) which is 1. This list is not directly used in the provided snippet.
6. **`suf`**: A list of 32 sublists, each containing two integers where `suf[j][1]` is the number of times the `j`-th bit was `1` across all `prefix[i]` values from `prefix[n]` to `prefix[1]`, and `suf[j][0]` is the number of times the `j`-th bit was `0` across all those values.
7. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **`cur`**: Initialized to `prefix[0]`, which is `0`.
9. **`j`**: Initialized to 32.

### Construction of `suf`
The `suf` list is constructed by analyzing the cumulative XOR values in the `prefix` list. Specifically, for each bit position `j` (from 0 to 31), `suf[j][1]` counts the number of times the `j`-th bit is `1` in the `prefix` values from `prefix[n]` to `prefix[1]`, and `suf[j][0]` counts the number of times the `j`-th bit is `0`.

### Output Analysis
Given the initial state, the `suf` list is fully determined by the `prefix` list. Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `suf`. However, we can describe the structure and the meaning of `suf` based on the given information.

- `suf` is a list of 32 sublists.
- Each sublist `suf[j]` contains two integers:
  - `suf[j][0]`: The number of times the `j`-th bit is `0` in the `prefix` values from `prefix[n]` to `prefix[1]`.
  - `suf[j][1]`: The number of times the `j`-th bit is `1` in the `prefix` values from `prefix[n]` to `prefix[1]`.

### Conclusion
The output will be a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist contains the count of `0`s and `1`s for each bit position across the `prefix` values from `prefix[n]` to `prefix[1]`.

Output: **suf (where suf is a list of 32 sublists, each containing the count of 0s and 1s for each bit position across the prefix values from prefix[n] to prefix[1])**
