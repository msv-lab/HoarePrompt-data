Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except each `pre[i][0]` for i in range(32) which is 1, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except for each `j` in range(32), `suf[j][1]` is 1 if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is 1, `i` is 30, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 0, and the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1**
