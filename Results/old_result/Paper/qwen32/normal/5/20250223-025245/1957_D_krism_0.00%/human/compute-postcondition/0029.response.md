The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since the range of the loop is from 0 to 31 (inclusive), the loop will execute again if `j` is less than 32. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except each `pre[i][0]` for i in range(32) which is 1, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, `i` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 1. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, then `suf[0][1]` is 1. Otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is 1**
