To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop is defined as:

```
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop iterates from `n` down to `1`, decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9
- `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`
- `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except each `pre[i][0]` for i in range(32) which is 1
- `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except for each `j` in range(32), `suf[j][1]` is 1 if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is 1
- `i` is 31
- `cur` is `prefix[31]`
- `j` is 32

Since the loop decrements `i` by `1` in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `30`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `suf`, `cur`, and `j`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `arr_i` satisfies 1 <= `arr_i` <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements where the first element is `0` and each subsequent element at index `i` (1 <= i <= n) is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except each `pre[i][0]` for i in range(32) which is 1, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, except for each `j` in range(32), `suf[j][1]` is 1 if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is 1, `i` is 30, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 32**
