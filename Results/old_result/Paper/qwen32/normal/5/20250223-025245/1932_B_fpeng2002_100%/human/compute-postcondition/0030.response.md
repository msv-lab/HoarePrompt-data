Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is at least 0; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the integers in the `nums` list.**

In this output state, the value of `num_tests` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
