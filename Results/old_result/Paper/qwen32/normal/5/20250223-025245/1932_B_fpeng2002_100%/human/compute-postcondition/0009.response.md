The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `nums`. Since `x` is the loop variable and `nums` is the list being iterated over, we need to adjust `x` for the next iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was 0, so for the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1.

The state of `nums` does not need to be changed because it is the list being iterated over and does not change within the loop head.

Now, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `x` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be 1.
- `nums` remains the same because it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is a positive integer and is now reduced by 1 from its initial value; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers and must have at least 1 integer; `start_year` is `nums[x]`; `x` is 1**
