You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is 0; `n` is the input integer from the last iteration; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers from the last iteration; `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the integers in the `nums` list from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and check if it adheres to the problem description for every potential case.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. There are `n` signs of the apocalypse.
2. The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.
3. The signs must occur sequentially.
4. If the i-th sign occurs in year `x`, the tribe starts waiting for the (i+1)-th sign from year `x+1`.
5. We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs using a loop that iteratively computes the next occurrence year for each sign.

### Logic in the Code:
- `start_year` is initialized to 0.
- For each sign, the next occurrence year is calculated as `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.

### Verification:
Let's verify the code with the provided example and check for any potential edge cases.

#### Example Verification:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
   - Calculation:
     - Start Year = 0
     - First Sign: `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Second Sign: `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - Third Sign: `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - Fourth Sign: `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - Fifth Sign: `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - Sixth Sign: `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
   - Output: `36` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Calculation:
     - Start Year = 0
     - First Sign: `(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - Second Sign: `(1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
     - Third Sign: `(2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Fourth Sign: `(3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
     - Fifth Sign: `(4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - Start Year = 0
     - First Sign: `(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - Second Sign: `(1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
     - Third Sign: `(2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
     - Fourth Sign: `(3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
     - Fifth Sign: `(4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
   - Calculation:
     - Start Year = 0
     - First Sign: `(0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
     - Second Sign: `(50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
     - Third Sign: `(60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
     - Fourth Sign: `(711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
     - Fifth Sign: `(800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
     - Sixth Sign: `(1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
   - Output: `2012` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs for the provided examples and adheres to the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases that the program does not handle correctly based on the logic provided.

**Correctness: True**. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens for every potential case based on the problem description.
