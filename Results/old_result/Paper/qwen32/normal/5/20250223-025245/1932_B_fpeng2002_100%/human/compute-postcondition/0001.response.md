Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `num_tests` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value of the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as an integer within the range of 1 to 1000.
