### Reasoning:

Let's thoroughly analyze the problem, the program, and the function summary provided to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
The Chaya tribe believes that the apocalypse will happen when a sequence of signs occur sequentially, with each sign occurring every `a_i` years. The task is to determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicity of each sign.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of signs `n`.
2. Reads the periodicities of the signs into a list `nums`.
3. Initializes `start_year` to 0, representing the year from which we start waiting for the first sign.
4. Iterates over each sign's periodicity in `nums`:
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of the sign's periodicity that is greater than the current `start_year`.
   - This is done using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which computes the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.
5. After processing all signs, it prints the final `start_year`, which represents the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse happens.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that the function calculates and prints the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list for each test case. However, this statement is not accurate based on the program's behavior. The program does not compute the LCM of the entire list of periodicities. Instead, it calculates the next occurrence year for each sign sequentially, ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

#### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Example Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Example Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

- For the first test case:
  - The first sign occurs in year 3.
  - The second sign occurs in year 4.
  - The third sign occurs in year 8.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 10.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 18.
  - The sixth sign occurs in year 36.
  - This matches the expected output.

- For the second test case:
  - The first sign occurs in year 1.
  - The second sign occurs in year 2.
  - The third sign occurs in year 3.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
  - This matches the expected output.

- For the third test case:
  - Since all signs occur every year, the n-th sign will occur in year 5.
  - This matches the expected output.

- For the fourth test case:
  - The first sign occurs in year 50.
  - The second sign occurs in year 60.
  - The third sign occurs in year 711.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 911.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 1414.
  - The sixth sign occurs in year 2012.
  - This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It calculates the year in which the last sign occurs and the apocalypse happens for each test case by ensuring each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The function summary is inaccurate, but the program's behavior is correct.

Final: **True**
