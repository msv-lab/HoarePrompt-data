The variable `start_year` is reassigned the value `0`. The other variables (`t`, `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `num_tests` is at least 0; `n` is the input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `start_year` is 0.**
