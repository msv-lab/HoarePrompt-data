The code snippet `sequence.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `sequence`. The values of `number` and `size` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The only change is in the `sequence` list, which now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` now includes `i` at the end, `size` remains unchanged and is the largest integer such that \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\) and `size` is greater than 0.**
