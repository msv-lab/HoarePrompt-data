To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition. The loop condition is:

```
while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
```

This can be rewritten as:

```
while (2^(size + 1)) - 1 <= number:
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `size` is increased by 2.
- `number` must be at least `2^(size + 1) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(2^(size + 1)) - 1 <= number` must be true. 

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Current State Analysis:**
   - `size` is increased by 2 from its previous value.
   - `number` is at least `2^(size + 1) - 1` based on the given condition.

2. **Next Iteration Requirement:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `number` must be at least `2^(size + 2) - 1` after `size` is increased by 2.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `size` is already increased by 2, we need to ensure that `number` is at least `2^(size + 2) - 1` for the loop to execute again.

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `number` to be at least `2^(size + 2) - 1`.

State: **`size` is increased by 2 and `number` must be at least `2^(size + 2) - 1`**
