The function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input integer `number` and appends the generated sequence to the `sequence` list. It returns the size of the generated sequence. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it constructs the sequence by recursively breaking down the problem and modifying the `sequence` list in place.
