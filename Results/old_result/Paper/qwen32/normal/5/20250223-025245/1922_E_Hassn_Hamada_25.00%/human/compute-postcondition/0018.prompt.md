Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: - `number` remains unchanged.
- `sequence` remains unchanged.
- `size` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\).

In natural language, the final output state is that `number` and `sequence` remain the same as they were initially, and `size` is the largest integer for which \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1\) is less than or equal to `number`.

Output State:
Code of the loop:
for i in range(size):
    sequence.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `number` remains unchanged, `sequence` now includes `i` at the end, `size` remains unchanged and is the largest integer such that \(2^{(\text{size} + 1)} - 1 \leq \text{number}\) and `size` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes the last `i` from the previous iteration and the newly incremented `i`, `size` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes the last `i` from the previous iteration and the newly incremented `i`, `size` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
