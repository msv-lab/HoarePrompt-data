You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences for an array can be calculated using combinations of its elements, especially when the array consists of repeated elements.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by generating a sequence of numbers based on the input number (X-1) using a recursive function `func_1`. The idea seems to be to construct an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

#### Key Points:
1. **Base Case**: If `number == 0`, the function returns 0, indicating no more elements are needed.
2. **Recursive Case**: The function calculates the size of the sequence needed to reach the given number of increasing subsequences. It then recursively builds the sequence by appending elements and adjusting them based on the results of the recursive call.
3. **Output**: The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

### Correctness Check:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the provided examples:

1. **X = 2**: The output is `1\n0`, which is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.
2. **X = 5**: The output is `3\n0 1 0`, which is correct because the array `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [1], [0, 1], [1, 0]`.
3. **X = 13**: The output is `5\n2 2 3 4 2`, which is correct because the array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
4. **X = 37**: The output is `7\n-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, which is correct because the array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

The program seems to correctly generate sequences that meet the required number of increasing subsequences for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct in generating an array with the required number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
