The code appends the current value of `i` to the `sequence` list. Given the initial state, `sequence` already includes the last `i` from the previous iteration, and `i` is about to be incremented. After appending `i`, `sequence` will now include this newly incremented value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes the last `i` from the previous iteration and the newly incremented `i`, `size` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
