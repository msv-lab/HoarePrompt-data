To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(size):`, which means the variables `i` and `size` are the only ones we can adjust.

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: This variable is the loop iterator. Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly defined because it is initialized by the `range(size)` function. Therefore, we do not need to set an initial value for `i` before the loop starts.
2. **`size`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `size` must be greater than 0.

### Adjustments:
- **`size`**: It must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- **`i`**: No initial value needs to be set for `i` as it is handled by the `range(size)` function.

### State:
The state should be adjusted to ensure `size` is greater than 0. The other variables (`number`, `sequence`, `result`) do not affect the execution of the loop directly and can remain as they are.

### Final Answer:
State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1`, `size` must be greater than 0, `result` is assigned the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**
