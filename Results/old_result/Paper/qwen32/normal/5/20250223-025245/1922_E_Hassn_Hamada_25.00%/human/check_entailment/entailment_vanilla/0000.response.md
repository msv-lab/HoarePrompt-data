Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences. The number of increasing subsequences for an array can be calculated using combinations of its elements, especially when the array consists of repeated elements.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve this problem by generating a sequence of numbers based on the input number (X-1) using a recursive function `func_1`. The idea seems to be to construct an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences.

#### Key Points:
1. **Base Case**: If `number == 0`, the function returns 0, indicating no more elements are needed.
2. **Recursive Case**: The function calculates the size of the sequence needed to reach the given number of increasing subsequences. It then recursively builds the sequence by appending elements and adjusting them based on the results of the recursive call.
3. **Output**: The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

### Correctness Check:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the provided examples:

1. **X = 2**: The output is `1\n0`, which is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.
2. **X = 5**: The output is `3\n0 1 0`, which is correct because the array `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [1], [0, 1], [1, 0]`.
3. **X = 13**: The output is `5\n2 2 3 4 2`, which is correct because the array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
4. **X = 37**: The output is `7\n-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, which is correct because the array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

The program seems to correctly generate sequences that meet the required number of increasing subsequences for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct in generating an array with the required number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
