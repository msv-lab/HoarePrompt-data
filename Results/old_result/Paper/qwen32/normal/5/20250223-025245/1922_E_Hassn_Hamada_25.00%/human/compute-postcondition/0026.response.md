To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change with each iteration. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `number` remains unchanged.
   - `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1`.
   - `size` remains unchanged.
   - `result` is assigned the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `size` iterations.
   - In each iteration `i`, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.

3. **Output State after Each Iteration**:
   - After 1 iteration: The element at index `-result - 0 - 1` is incremented by `result` once.
   - After 2 iterations: The element at index `-result - 1 - 1` is incremented by `result` once, and the element at index `-result - 0 - 1` is incremented by `result` twice.
   - After 3 iterations: The element at index `-result - 2 - 1` is incremented by `result` once, the element at index `-result - 1 - 1` is incremented by `result` twice, and the element at index `-result - 0 - 1` is incremented by `result` three times.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - After `size` iterations, each element at index `-result - i - 1` for `i` from `0` to `size - 1` will have been incremented by `result` exactly `i + 1` times.
   - `number` remains unchanged.
   - `size` remains unchanged.
   - `result` remains the same value as assigned initially.

Putting this into the required format:

Output State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1` with the element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result` exactly `i + 1` times for each `i` from `0` to `size - 1`, `size` remains unchanged, `result` remains the same value as assigned initially.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the `number` and `size` remain the same. The `result` also remains unchanged. The `sequence` will have its elements incremented based on the specific pattern described.
