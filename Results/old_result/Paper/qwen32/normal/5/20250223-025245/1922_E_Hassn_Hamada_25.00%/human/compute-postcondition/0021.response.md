The code modifies the `sequence` list by incrementing the element at the index `-result - i - 1` by the value of `result`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, the `sequence` list includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1`, and `result` is the output of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. The specific value of `result` and `i` are not provided, but we can describe the change to the `sequence` list.

The element at the index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` list is incremented by `result`. This means the value at that specific position in the list is increased by `result`.

Output State: **`number` remains unchanged, `sequence` includes all integers from `0` to `size - 1` with the element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result`, `size` must be greater than 0, `result` is assigned the value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**.
