The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `cnt` was initially an empty list, after this operation, `cnt` will contain the single element `k`.

The values of `cur`, `M`, `S`, and the current value of `M[k]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is the highest value in `N` that does not cause a break condition, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of all values in `M`, `cnt` is a list containing the element `k`, and the current value of `M[k]` is 1.**
