Postcondition: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` that have a value of 1 (which is currently an empty list since `M` is empty), `T` remains unchanged, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`**
