Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is `N[N.index(num_next) + 1]`, `cur` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the value of `cur` is increased by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
