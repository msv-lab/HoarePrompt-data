Postcondition: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `cur` remains unchanged.**
