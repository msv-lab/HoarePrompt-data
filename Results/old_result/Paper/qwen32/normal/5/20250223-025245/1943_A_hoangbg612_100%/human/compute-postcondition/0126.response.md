Output State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `N`, `T`, `S`, `num`, and `cur` remain as described, with `cur` incremented by 1, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
