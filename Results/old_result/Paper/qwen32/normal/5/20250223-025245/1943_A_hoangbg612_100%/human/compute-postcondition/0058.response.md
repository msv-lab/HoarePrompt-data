The code snippet sets the variable `cur` to -1. This does not affect the values of `M`, `S`, `cnt`, `T`, or `N`. Therefore, the only change is that `cur` is now -1.

Output State: **`cur` is -1, `M` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` contains all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k] == 1`, if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input.**
