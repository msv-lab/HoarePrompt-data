The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which is the variable being iterated over from the list `N`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `num` for the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is a list containing at least one element.
- `T` remains unchanged.
- `S` is the input integer.
- `num` is the next element in `N`.
- If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in the list `N`. Since `num` is the current element being processed, the next iteration will naturally take the next element from `N`.

State: **`N` is a list containing at least one element, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is the input integer, `num` is the next element in `N`**. 

Note: The states of `cur` and `M[cur]` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted here. They are updated within the loop body based on the value of `num`.
