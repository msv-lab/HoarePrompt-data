The given code snippet is `M[cur] += 1`. This line increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1.

Let's break down the possible scenarios based on the provided initial state:

1. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur] = 1`.
2. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is a dictionary with the key -1 having a value of 1.

Given that `M[cur] += 1` is executed, it means that `cur` must have already been a key in the dictionary `M` because you cannot increment a value of a key that does not exist in a dictionary.

Let's consider the two scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: `num` is greater than `cur`. In this case, `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is initialized to 1. The next line `M[cur] += 1` would then increment `M[cur]` to 2.
- **Scenario 2**: `cur` remains -1. In this case, `M[cur]` is already 1 (as per the initial state). The line `M[cur] += 1` would then increment `M[cur]` to 2.

In both scenarios, the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` is incremented by 1.

Given these scenarios, the output state would be:

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is `num_next`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur] = 2`. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M[-1] = 2`.**
