The given code snippet contains only a `break` statement, which means it will terminate the innermost loop or if statement it is placed in. However, it does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `T`, `n`, `a`, `S`, `N`, `num`, `cur`, and `M` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is `num_next`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur] = 1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is a dictionary with the key -1 having a value of 1. `cur` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
