Output State: **`cur` is the last number in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`; otherwise, `cur` remains the last number in `N`. `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the input integer, `cnt` is a list containing `k` if `M[k] == 1`; otherwise, `cnt` now includes `k`. `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer, `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the current `k`.**

In simple terms: The list `cnt` now includes the key `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
