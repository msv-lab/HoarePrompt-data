The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which iterates over the elements of the list `N`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `N` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`cur`, `M`, `S`, `cnt`, and `T`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cnt` is an empty set, `T` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer**
