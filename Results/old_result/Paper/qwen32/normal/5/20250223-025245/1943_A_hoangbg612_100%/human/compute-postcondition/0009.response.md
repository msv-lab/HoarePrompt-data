Postcondition: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element. The current value of `cur` is -1, and `num` is greater than `cur`. Additionally, `num` is greater than `cur + 1` (i.e., `num` is at least 0). `M` is an empty dictionary.**
