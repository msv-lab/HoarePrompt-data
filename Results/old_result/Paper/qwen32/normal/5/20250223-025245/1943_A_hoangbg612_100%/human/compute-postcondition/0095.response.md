Postcondition: **`cur` is the last number in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`; otherwise, `cur` remains the last number in `N`. `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the input integer. If `M[k]` is equal to 1, `cnt` is a list containing the key `k`; otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list. `T` remains unchanged, and `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input and must have at least one integer.**
