The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `S`. The values of `T`, `n`, and the array `a` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer.**
