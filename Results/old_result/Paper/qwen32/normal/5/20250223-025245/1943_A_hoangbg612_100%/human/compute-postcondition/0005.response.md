The code snippet only assigns the value `-1` to the variable `cur`. None of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `a`, `S`, `N`) are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), `a` is an array of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is -1.**
