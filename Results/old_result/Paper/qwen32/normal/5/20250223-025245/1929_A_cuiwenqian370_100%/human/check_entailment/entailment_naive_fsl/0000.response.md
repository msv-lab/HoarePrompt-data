Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to find the maximum beauty of an array `a` by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).

### Program Analysis:

**Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
- The function sorts the array.
- It then calculates the beauty of the sorted array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the key to achieving the maximum beauty.

**Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
- This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
- For each test case, it reads the array, calls `func_1` to compute the beauty, and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Analysis:

The approach taken by the program is correct. Sorting the array ensures that the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which is the optimal way to achieve the maximum beauty. Here's why:

- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the smallest element is first, the largest is last, and the intermediate elements are in between. This arrangement maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.
- **Beauty Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted array and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements, the program correctly computes the beauty of the array.

### Verification with Example Cases:

Let's verify the program with the provided example cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 1 3`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: \(|2-1| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\)

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `69 69 69`
   - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: \(|69-69| + |69-69| = 0 + 0 = 0\)

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: \(|54-43| + |80-54| + |90-80| + |100-90| = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: \(|3-3| + |3-3| + |4-3| = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: \(|2-1| = 1\)

All the example cases are handled correctly by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and calculating the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since it handles all the provided example cases correctly and the logic is sound, we can conclude that the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**.
