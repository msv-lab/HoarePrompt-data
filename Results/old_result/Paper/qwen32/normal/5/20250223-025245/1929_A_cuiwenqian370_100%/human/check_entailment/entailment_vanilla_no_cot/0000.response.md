Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect for determining the maximum beauty of the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The current implementation sorts the array and then calculates the beauty, which does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty.

To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the largest and smallest elements are placed alternately. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then interleaving the smallest and largest elements.

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    n = len(array)
    beauty = 0
    # Interleave smallest and largest elements
    for i in range(n // 2):
        beauty += array[n - 1 - i] - array[i]
    if n % 2 == 0:
        beauty += array[n // 2] - array[n // 2 - 1]
    return beauty
```

However, a simpler and more effective approach is to sort the array and then compute the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which is actually the same as the original `func_1`. But to achieve the maximum beauty, we need to consider the absolute differences between the smallest and largest elements directly.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1` to achieve the maximum beauty:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    return sum(array[i] - array[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(array)))
```

This is actually the same as the original `func_1`, but the logic behind achieving the maximum beauty is different. The original `func_1` is correct in terms of calculating the beauty of the sorted array, but the problem requires maximizing the beauty, which is achieved by sorting and summing the differences as described.

Given that the original `func_1` is indeed calculating the beauty correctly for a sorted array, which is the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty, the original program is correct.

Therefore, the correct response is:

Correctness: **True**
