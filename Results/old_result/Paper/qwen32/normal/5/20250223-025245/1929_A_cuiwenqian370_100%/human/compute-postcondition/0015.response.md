The code snippet `array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` updates the `array` variable by converting the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers. This means `array` now holds the integer values from the specified slice of `data`.

The other variables (`input`, `data`, `t`, `index`, `results`, `n`, `result`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

So, the Output State is:
Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer, `t` is 1, `index` is `index + 1`, `results` is a list containing `result`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**.
