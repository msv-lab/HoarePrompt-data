### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze whether the program correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array after rearranging its elements.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - To maximize this beauty, we need to arrange the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - The optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty is to sort the array in either ascending or descending order.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the elements of the array.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the array as an argument.
   - `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The beauty is printed for each test case.

3. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - Sorting the array in ascending (or descending) order ensures that the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - The program correctly calculates the beauty as the sum of these differences.
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating through the input data and processing each test case independently.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to compute the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
