The code snippet provided increments the `index` variable by 1. This change does not affect the values of other variables directly. The `index` variable is used to navigate through the `data` list, but since it is only incremented, the current value of `array`, `input`, `data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is 2; `index` is `index + 2 + n`; `results` is a list containing two `result` values; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**.

In simpler terms, the `index` is incremented by 1, so it now points to the next element in the `data` list compared to its previous state. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
