The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Given that `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, we need to ensure that `data` has at least one element and that this element can be converted to a positive integer.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
