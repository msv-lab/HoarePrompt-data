To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the code snippet on the variables. The code snippet calls a function `func_1` with `array` as an argument and assigns the result to the variable `result`. This operation does not change the values of `array`, `input`, `data`, `t`, `index`, or `results`. It only introduces a new variable `result` with the value returned by `func_1`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state will be:

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `index` is `index + n`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is `int(data[1])`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`.**
