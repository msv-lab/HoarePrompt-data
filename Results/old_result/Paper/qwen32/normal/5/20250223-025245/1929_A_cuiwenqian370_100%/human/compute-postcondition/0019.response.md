The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable in the `for` loop and does not affect the state in the way other variables do, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, which means the loop has already executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be incremented.

However, based on the provided information, `t` is set to 1 and does not change within the loop. Therefore, the loop is designed to run exactly once. If we were to adjust the state to allow for another iteration, we would need to increment `t`.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is 2; `index` is `index + 1 + n`; `results` is a list containing two `result` values; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**

Note: This state assumes that we are intentionally modifying `t` to allow for another iteration, which is not the original behavior of the loop as described.
