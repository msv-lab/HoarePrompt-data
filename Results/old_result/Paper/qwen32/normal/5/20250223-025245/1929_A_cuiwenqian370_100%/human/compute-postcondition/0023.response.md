The code snippet `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is 2; `index` is `index + 2 + n + n`; `results` is a list containing two `result` values; `n` is `int(data[index - n - 2 - n])`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**.

In simpler terms, `index` is increased by `n`, so the new value of `index` is its previous value plus `n`. All other variables retain their previous values.
