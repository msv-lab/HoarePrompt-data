Reasoning: 
The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is maximized when the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. Sorting the array in either ascending or descending order guarantees that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated version to ensure the correctness:

1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - The function sorts the array, which ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The annotation confirms that the array is sorted and the beauty is calculated correctly by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the elements of the array.
   - It then calls `func_1(array)` to compute the maximum beauty for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed after processing all test cases.
   - The annotation confirms that the input is read correctly, the array is processed, and the results are printed as expected.

The logic in both functions aligns with the problem description. The program reads the input, sorts the array to maximize the beauty, computes the beauty, and outputs the results correctly for each test case.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
