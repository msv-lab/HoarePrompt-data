Reasoning: 

The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after potentially rearranging the array. The function `func_1` sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the absolute difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array will always yield the maximum possible sum, `func_1` correctly computes the maximum beauty for a single test case.

Function `func_2` handles the input for multiple test cases, reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the array size and the array elements. It then calls `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each test case and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases. This function correctly orchestrates the processing of multiple test cases and utilizes `func_1` to compute the required result.

Since both functions work together to correctly solve the problem as described, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
