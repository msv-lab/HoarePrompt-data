The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial state of the other variables (`array`, `input`, `data`, `t`, and `index`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n where 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
