You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a result using the `func_1` function and prints the result. The overall effect is to process each test case individually and output the corresponding result.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning: 
The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, where beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order. This is because the sum of differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the differences themselves are maximized, which occurs when the array is sorted in one of these orders.

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, the absolute differences are simply the differences (as the array is either non-decreasing or non-increasing). This function correctly calculates the maximum beauty for a given array.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and uses `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty for each test case. It then prints the results.

The logic in both functions is correct and aligns with the problem description. The program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by sorting the array and computing the beauty, and outputs the results correctly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
