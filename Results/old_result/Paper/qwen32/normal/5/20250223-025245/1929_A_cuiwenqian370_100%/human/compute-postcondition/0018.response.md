The code snippet provided appends the `result` to the `results` list. Based on the initial state, the value of `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`, and `results` already contains `result`. After executing the code, `results` will have two elements: the original `result` and the newly appended `result`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `input` is assigned the `sys.stdin.read` function; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element where the first element is a positive integer; `t` is 1; `index` is `index + 1 + n`; `results` is a list containing two `result` values; `n` is `int(data[index])`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(array)`**.
