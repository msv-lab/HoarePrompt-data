s is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and n is an integer initialized to 0, ans is an integer initialized to 0. The relationship is that n counts the number of '1's encountered in the string s up to the current index, and ans accumulates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0'.
