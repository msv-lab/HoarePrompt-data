The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop uses `t` in a `range` function, `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**
