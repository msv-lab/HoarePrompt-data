### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for sorting the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to confirm this:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of each cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The task is to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted order.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` attempts to calculate the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0'.
   - For each '0' encountered after some '1's, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost, where `n` is the count of '1's before that '0'.
   - However, this logic does not correctly account for the minimum cost of sorting the string. It overestimates the cost in cases where multiple '0's are encountered after multiple '1's.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - **Input:** `101011`
     - `n` becomes 1 after the first '1'.
     - When encountering the first '0', `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - `n` becomes 2 after the second '1'.
     - When encountering the second '0', `ans` becomes `2 + 3 = 5`.
     - `n` becomes 3 after the third '1'.
     - `n` becomes 4 after the fourth '1'.
     - When encountering the third '0', `ans` becomes `5 + 5 = 10`.
     - When encountering the fourth '0', `ans` becomes `10 + 5 = 15`.
     - **Output:** `15` (Incorrect, should be `5`).

   - **Input:** `01101001`
     - `n` becomes 1 after the first '1'.
     - When encountering the first '0', `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - `n` becomes 2 after the second '1'.
     - `n` becomes 3 after the third '1'.
     - When encountering the second '0', `ans` becomes `2 + 4 = 6`.
     - `n` becomes 4 after the fourth '1'.
     - When encountering the third '0', `ans` becomes `6 + 5 = 11`.
     - When encountering the fourth '0', `ans` becomes `11 + 5 = 16`.
     - **Output:** `16` (Incorrect, should be `11`).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle all cases correctly. The logic overestimates the cost in certain scenarios, leading to incorrect outputs.
