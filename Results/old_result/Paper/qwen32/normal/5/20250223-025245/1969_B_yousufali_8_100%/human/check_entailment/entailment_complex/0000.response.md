Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here's a breakdown of their functionality:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads a binary string `s`.
   - Initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - Iterates through each character in the string:
     - Increments `n` if the character is '1'.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because encountering a '0' after one or more '1's means that each '1' before this '0' needs to be shifted past this '0', incurring a cost of `n + 1` for each such '0'.
   - Prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case, effectively processing each binary string independently.

The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string based on the described cyclic shift operation. Specifically, it accounts for the cost incurred each time a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's by shifting those '1's past the '0'. The cost for each such shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's encountered before the '0'.

The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

Therefore, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
