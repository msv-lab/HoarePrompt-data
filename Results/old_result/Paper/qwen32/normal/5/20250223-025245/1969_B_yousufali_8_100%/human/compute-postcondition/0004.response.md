To provide a specific output state, we need to know the definition of the function `func_1()`. Since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, I will assume that `func_1()` does not modify any variables or return any value. If `func_1()` does not affect the variables in the initial state, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
