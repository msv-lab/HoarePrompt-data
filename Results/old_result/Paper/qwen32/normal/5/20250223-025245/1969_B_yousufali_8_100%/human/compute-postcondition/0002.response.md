To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. Since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we can only assume that it might modify the variable `t` or have other side effects. However, based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables inside `func_1()`. Therefore, we will consider the general case where `func_1()` could potentially change the value of `t` or introduce new variables.

Given the initial state only specifies that `t` must be greater than 0, and without knowing the specifics of `func_1()`, we can only say that `t` could be modified or other variables could be introduced.

Since we have no further information, let's assume that `func_1()` does not change `t` and does not introduce any new variables. If it does change `t`, we would need more information about how it changes.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**. 

If `func_1()` modifies `t` or introduces new variables, we would need that additional information to provide a more accurate output state.
