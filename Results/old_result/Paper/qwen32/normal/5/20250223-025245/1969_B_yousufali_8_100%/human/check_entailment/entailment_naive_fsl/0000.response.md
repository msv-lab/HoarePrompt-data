Let's analyze the given program and see if it meets the problem description for all potential cases.

### Analysis of the Program

The problem requires us to compute the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of a cyclic shift of a substring is the length of that substring.

The provided code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function reads a single binary string, computes the minimum cost to sort it, and prints the result.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

#### Function `func_1()`

Here is the function `func_1()` in detail:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```
This function iterates through the string `s`. It keeps track of the number of '1's encountered so far in the variable `n`. Whenever it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the answer `ans`.

### Correctness of the Program

Let's analyze whether this logic correctly computes the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

The key observation here is that the cost to sort the string can be computed by counting the number of '1's encountered before each '0' and summing up the costs accordingly. Specifically, for each '0' encountered after some '1's, the cost to move those '1's before the '0' is the number of '1's plus one (the length of the substring involved in the cyclic shift).

Let's consider the example cases provided in the problem description:

1. **Input:** `10`
   - `n` becomes 1 when encountering the first '1'.
   - When encountering the '0', `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - **Output:** `2` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `0000`
   - No '1's are encountered, so `ans` remains 0.
   - **Output:** `0` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `11000`
   - `n` becomes 2 when encountering the first two '1's.
   - When encountering the first '0', `ans` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - When encountering the second '0', `ans` becomes `3 + 3 = 6`.
   - When encountering the third '0', `ans` becomes `6 + 3 = 9`.
   - **Output:** `9` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `101011`
   - `n` becomes 1 when encountering the first '1'.
   - When encountering the first '0', `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `n` becomes 2 when encountering the second '1'.
   - When encountering the second '0', `ans` becomes `2 + 3 = 5`.
   - `n` becomes 3 when encountering the third '1'.
   - `n` becomes 4 when encountering the fourth '1'.
   - When encountering the third '0', `ans` becomes `5 + 5 = 10`.
   - When encountering the fourth '0', `ans` becomes `10 + 5 = 15`.
   - **Output:** `15` (Incorrect, should be `5`)

5. **Input:** `01101001`
   - `n` becomes 1 when encountering the first '1'.
   - When encountering the first '0', `ans` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `n` becomes 2 when encountering the second '1'.
   - `n` becomes 3 when encountering the third '1'.
   - When encountering the second '0', `ans` becomes `2 + 4 = 6`.
   - `n` becomes 4 when encountering the fourth '1'.
   - When encountering the third '0', `ans` becomes `6 + 5 = 11`.
   - When encountering the fourth '0', `ans` becomes `11 + 5 = 16`.
   - **Output:** `16` (Incorrect, should be `11`)

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for some test cases. Specifically, it overestimates the cost in cases where multiple '0's are encountered after multiple '1's.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle all cases correctly, as demonstrated by the incorrect outputs for the test cases `101011` and `01101001`.
