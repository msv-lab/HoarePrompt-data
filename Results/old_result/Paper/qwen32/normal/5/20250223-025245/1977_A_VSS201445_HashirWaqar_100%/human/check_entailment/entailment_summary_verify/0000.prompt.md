You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference (`n - m`) is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly 1 cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- For each test case, output "Yes" if possible, "No" otherwise.

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `n >= m`:** 
   - This condition checks if the number of moves `n` is at least as many as the number of cubes `m` we want in the final tower. This is necessary because if `n < m`, we can't possibly have `m` cubes after `n` moves since we can only add or remove one cube at a time.
   - **Correctness:** This part of the condition is correct.

2. **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`:**
   - This condition checks if the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is even. This is necessary because adding or removing one cube changes the number of cubes by 1, which is an odd number. To end up with an exact number of cubes `m` after `n` moves, the number of "net additions" (or removals) must be even.
   - **Correctness:** This part of the condition is also correct.

However, there is a missing edge case in the provided program:
- The program does not account for the scenario where `n < m`. Although the condition `n >= m` handles this, the logic `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is not applicable in this case. When `n < m`, the only way to have `m` cubes is if `n` is large enough to make up the difference, but the logic should handle this directly.

### Correctness Check:
- The program handles the cases where `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` correctly.
- However, the program should handle the case where `n < m` separately. If `n < m`, the program should check if `(m - n) % 2 == 0` to determine if it is possible to reach `m` cubes by adding cubes.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the test case:
- Input: `1\n3 1`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add 1 cube and then remove 2 cubes to end up with 1 cube after 3 moves).
- Actual Output: `NO` (The program incorrectly outputs `NO` because `n < m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is not checked).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n < m` correctly.

**Correctness: False**. 

The program should be modified to handle the case where `n < m` by checking if `(m - n) % 2 == 0`.
