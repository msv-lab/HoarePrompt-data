Let's analyze the problem and the given solution.

The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move. The question is whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. 

For it to be possible:
1. The number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because if `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes (since each removal can only decrease the number of cubes).
2. The difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must be even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, so the net effect of an even number of moves can be an even number of cubes (either added or removed).

The given program checks these two conditions:
- `n >= m`: Ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach `m` cubes.
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: Ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, which means the net effect of the moves can result in exactly `m` cubes.

The program correctly prints "YES" if both conditions are met and "NO" otherwise. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
