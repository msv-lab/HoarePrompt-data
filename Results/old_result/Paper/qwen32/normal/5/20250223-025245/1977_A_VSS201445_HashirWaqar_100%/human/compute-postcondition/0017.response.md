Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each of the `t` iterations, two integers `n` and `m` were provided, and the program printed 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference (`n - m`) is even, otherwise it printed 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing all iterations.**

In simpler terms: After the loop has run for all `t` iterations, the program will have checked each pair of `n` and `m` values, printing 'YES' if `n` is at least `m` and their difference is even, or 'NO' otherwise. The initial value of `t` and the subsequent pairs of `n` and `m` remain the same after the loop completes.
