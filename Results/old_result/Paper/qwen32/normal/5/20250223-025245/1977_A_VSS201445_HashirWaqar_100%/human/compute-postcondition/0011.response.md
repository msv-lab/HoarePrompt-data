Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input function. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference (`n - m`) is even, the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition does not hold, and the else part executes, but the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.**
