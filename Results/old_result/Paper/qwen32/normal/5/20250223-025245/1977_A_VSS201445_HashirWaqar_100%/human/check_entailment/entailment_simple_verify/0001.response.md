### Reasoning:

Let's evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description, the program code, and the annotated version.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can make `n` moves, where each move is either adding or removing exactly one cube.
- We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The conditions for a valid scenario are:
  1. `n` must be at least `m` because each removal move can't result in a positive number of cubes if we start from 0 and can't go below 0.
  2. The difference `n - m` must be even because each pair of an "add" and a "remove" move cancels out to a net change of 0, and any remaining moves must be balanced to reach `m`.

#### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Annotations:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
- If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment correctly identifies that `n` must be at least `m` and that the difference `n - m` must be even.
- It also correctly notes that since `1 ≤ m ≤ 100`, `m` can never be 0, so the condition `n >= m` is valid.

#### Evaluation:
- The conditions `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` are necessary and sufficient to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The program correctly implements these conditions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly checks the necessary and sufficient conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
