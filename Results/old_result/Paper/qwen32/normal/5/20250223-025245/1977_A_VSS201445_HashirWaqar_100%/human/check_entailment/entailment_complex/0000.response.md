### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. The key insight is that the difference between the number of moves (`n`) and the number of cubes (`m`) must be even for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change, and any remaining moves must be additions or removals that balance out to an even number.

The given program correctly implements this logic by checking if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `n - m` is even. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Let's verify this with the example provided:
1. For the first test case (n=3, m=3):
   - `n >= m` is true (3 >= 3)
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is true (0 % 2 == 0)
   - The output is "YES", which is correct.

2. For the second test case (n=2, m=4):
   - `n >= m` is false (2 < 4)
   - The output is "NO", which is correct.

3. For the third test case (n=5, m=3):
   - `n >= m` is true (5 >= 3)
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is true (2 % 2 == 0)
   - The output is "YES", which is correct.

Since the program correctly handles the given examples and the logic is sound, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
