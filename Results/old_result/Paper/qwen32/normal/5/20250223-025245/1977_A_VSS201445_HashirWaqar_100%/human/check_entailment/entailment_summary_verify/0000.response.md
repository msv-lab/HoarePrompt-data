Let's carefully analyze the given program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description and function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikita can either add or remove exactly 1 cube per move.
- We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- For each test case, output "Yes" if possible, "No" otherwise.

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Function Summary:
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each of the next `t` lines, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference (`n - m`) is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program checks if `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. However, it incorrectly states that the program does not handle the case where `n < m` correctly. Let's re-evaluate this.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Condition `n >= m`:**
   - This condition ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as many as the number of cubes `m` we want in the final tower. This is necessary because if `n < m`, we can't possibly have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - **Correctness:** This part is correct.

2. **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`:**
   - This condition checks if the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` is even. This is necessary because adding or removing one cube changes the number of cubes by 1, which is an odd number. To end up with an exact number of cubes `m` after `n` moves, the number of "net additions" (or removals) must be even.
   - **Correctness:** This part is correct.

3. **Handling the Case `n < m`:**
   - If `n < m`, it means we need more moves than the number of cubes we want. However, the program correctly handles this scenario by checking `n >= m`. If `n < m`, the condition `n >= m` will fail, and the program will print 'NO'.
   - **Correctness:** This part is also correct because if `n < m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves if `n` is less than `m` and the difference is not even (which is always the case when `n < m`).

### Counterexample Re-evaluation:
The original assessment provides a counterexample:
- Input: `1\n3 1`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (Nikita can add 1 cube and then remove 2 cubes to end up with 1 cube after 3 moves).
- Actual Output: `NO` (The program incorrectly outputs `NO` because `n < m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is not checked).

However, let's re-evaluate this:
- For `n = 3` and `m = 1`, we need to check if it's possible to have 1 cube after 3 moves.
- We can add 1 cube and then remove 2 cubes, which is possible because `3 - 1 = 2` and `2 % 2 == 0`. The condition `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is satisfied.
- Therefore, the program should output `YES`.

The original assessment is incorrect in stating that the program does not handle the case `n < m` correctly. The program does handle it correctly by checking `n >= m`.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and function summary.

**Final: True**
