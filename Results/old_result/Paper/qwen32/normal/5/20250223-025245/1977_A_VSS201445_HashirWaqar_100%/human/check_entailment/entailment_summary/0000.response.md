Reasoning: The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the key points are:

1. Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move.
2. We need to determine if after `n` moves, the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.

The solution checks if `n` (the number of moves) is at least `m` (the desired number of cubes). If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes we can add is `n`. 

Additionally, the solution checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. This condition ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, so to end up with a specific number of cubes, the number of additions and subtractions must balance out to an even difference.

For example:
- If `n = 3` and `m = 3`, `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is `True`, so the output is "YES".
- If `n = 2` and `m = 4`, `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is `False`, and `n` is less than `m`, so the output is "NO".
- If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is `True`, so the output is "YES".

The execution summary aligns with the problem's requirements and correctly describes the program's behavior.

Correctness: **True**
