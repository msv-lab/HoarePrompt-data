The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes conditions related to the variables `t`, `n`, and `m`, but these conditions do not influence the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement is static and will always output `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer with a value between 1 and 100, inclusive. This variable is not used in the `print` statement.
2. The variables `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input function. The initial state specifies that either `n` is less than `m` or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even. These conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
