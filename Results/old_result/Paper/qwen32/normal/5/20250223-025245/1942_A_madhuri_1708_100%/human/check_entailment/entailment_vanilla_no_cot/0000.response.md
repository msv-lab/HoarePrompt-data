Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Sorted Array Definition**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next one.
2. **Cyclic Shifts**: For an array `a` of length `n`, a cyclic shift `x` is defined as `[a_x, a_{x+1}, ..., a_n, a_1, ..., a_{x-1}]`.
3. **Task**: For given integers `n` (length of the array) and `k` (number of sorted cyclic shifts), find an array `a` such that exactly `k` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted. If no such array exists, return `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program handles different cases based on the value of `k`:
- If `k >= 2`:
  - If `n == k`, it prints an array of length `n` where every element is `k`. This array will have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts because all elements are the same and thus every cyclic shift is sorted.
  - If `n != k`, it prints `-1`. This is a correct approach because having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `n != k` is not feasible for `k >= 2` (as it implies some non-trivial ordering that can't be achieved with all elements being the same).
- If `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`):
  - It prints an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself), which satisfies the condition.

### Correctness Check:
- **Case 1: `k >= 2` and `n == k`**:
  - The program correctly outputs an array of length `n` with all elements equal to `k`. This array has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
- **Case 2: `k >= 2` and `n != k`**:
  - The program correctly outputs `-1`. It's not possible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `n != k` and `k >= 2`.
- **Case 3: `k == 1`**:
  - The program correctly outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
