You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10³. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10³. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10³.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: a sequence of printed results for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number of test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a sequence of numbers based on the conditions: if `k` is at least 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times; if `k` is at least 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`; if `k` is less than 2, it prints numbers from 1 to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid array for certain values of `n` and `k` that should have a solution. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Case when `k == 1`**:
   - The program correctly generates an array `[1, 2, ..., n]` which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself).
   - Example: For `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the output is `1 2 3`, which is correct.

2. **Case when `k >= 2` and `k == n`**:
   - The program correctly generates an array with all elements equal to `k`, which results in all cyclic shifts being sorted.
   - Example: For `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the output is `3 3 3`, which is correct.

3. **Case when `k >= 2` and `k < n`**:
   - The program outputs `-1` for these cases, which is incorrect.
   - There are valid arrays that can have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k < n`.
   - Example: For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `-1`, but a valid array would be `[1, 2, 1]` which has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`.

To summarize, the program does not handle the case where `k >= 2` and `k < n` correctly. It should be able to generate an array that satisfies the conditions for these cases, but it currently outputs `-1` for them, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
