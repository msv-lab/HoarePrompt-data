To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
n, k = map(int, s.split())
```

This line of code splits the string `s` into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively.

Given the initial state, `s` is assigned from the second line onwards in each iteration of the loop. However, the specific value of `s` is not provided, so we can only describe the transformation in terms of `s`.

The transformation is:
- `s` is split into two parts.
- The first part of the split is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`.
- The second part of the split is converted to an integer and assigned to `k`.

Since the value of `s` is not specified, we can denote the split parts as `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` and `s2` are the first and second parts of `s` after splitting.

Thus, `n` will be `int(s1)` and `k` will be `int(s2)`.

The precondition that there are at least two lines in the input file remains valid, and `t` must still be at least 2.

Output State: **`n` is `int(s1)`, `k` is `int(s2)`, and there are at least two lines in the input file, meaning `t` is at least 2.**
