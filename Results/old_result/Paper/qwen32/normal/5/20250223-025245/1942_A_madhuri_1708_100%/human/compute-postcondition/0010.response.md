Postcondition: **`n` is `int(s1)`, `k` is `int(s2)`, and there are at least two lines in the input file (meaning `t` is at least 2). If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then `n` is equal to `k` if initially `n` was equal to `k`; otherwise, `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k` is less than 2, then the condition `k < 2` holds true.**
