The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `inf`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these variables. If `i` is less than `inf`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `inf` is 200001. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. Since `inf` is 200001, the loop can continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 200001.

The states `t`, `values`, and `sum_value_digits` are not part of the loop head, so they should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[1]` which is `t`, `i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is `t`**
