To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a variable that is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `inf` is a constant set to 200001.
   - `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, except for `values[200000]` which is `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000.
   - `value` is an input integer.

2. **Understanding `values` List:**
   - The list `values` is initialized with 200001 zeros.
   - `values[200000]` is set to a specific value which is `t` plus the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000.

3. **Cumulative Sum of Digits:**
   - We need to calculate the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000.
   - This involves iterating through each number from 1 to 200000, breaking it down into its individual digits, and summing these digits.

4. **Value of `values[value]`:**
   - The `print` statement outputs `values[value]`.
   - If `value` is any number between 0 and 199999, the output will be `0` because all elements in `values` from index 0 to 199999 are initialized to 0.
   - If `value` is `200000`, the output will be `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000.

Given that we do not have a specific value for `t` or `value`, we can describe the output based on these conditions.

**Output Explanation:**
- If `value` is between 0 and 199999, the output will be `0`.
- If `value` is `200000`, the output will be `t` plus the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000.

Since the exact value of `t` and `value` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **0 if `value` is between 0 and 199999, otherwise `t + sum_of_digits` (where `sum_of_digits` is the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000)**
