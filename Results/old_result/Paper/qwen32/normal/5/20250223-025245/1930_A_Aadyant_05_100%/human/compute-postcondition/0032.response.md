The code snippet `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of words using whitespace as the delimiter. This will change the value of `list1`, making it a list of substrings from `b`.

Given the initial state, here are the changes and the resulting output state:

- `list1` is initially an empty list. After the execution of `list1 = b.split()`, `list1` will contain the substrings of `b` split by whitespace.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user (new value); `list2` is an empty list; `num` is `num + 1`; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace.**
