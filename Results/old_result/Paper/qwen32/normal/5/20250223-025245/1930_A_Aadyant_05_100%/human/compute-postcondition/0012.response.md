The code appends the integer value of `str` to `list2`. Given that `str` is the next substring in `list1`, and `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace, the integer value of `str` is added to `list2`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50
- `a` is a string input by the user
- `final` is an empty list
- `s` is 0
- `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `n`
- `b` is a non-empty string input by the user that contains at least one substring separated by whitespace or is a single non-empty substring
- `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace and must have at least one element
- `str` is the next substring in `list1`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is an empty list; `s` is 0; `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `n` and the integer value of `str`; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user that contains at least one substring separated by whitespace or is a single non-empty substring; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace and must have at least one element; `str` is the next substring in `list1`**

In simpler terms, `list2` now contains two elements: the initial integer value of `n` and the integer value of `str`. All other variables remain unchanged.
