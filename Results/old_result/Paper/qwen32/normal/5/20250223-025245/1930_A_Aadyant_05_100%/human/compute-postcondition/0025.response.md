The code snippet appends the value of `s` to the `final` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `list2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `final` now contains the value of `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is the sum of the integers at even indices in `list2`; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace.**
