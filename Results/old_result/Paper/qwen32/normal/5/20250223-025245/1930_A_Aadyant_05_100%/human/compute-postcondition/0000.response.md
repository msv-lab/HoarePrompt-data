The code snippet `n = input()` will read an input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. Since the input function returns a string, `n` will be a string representation of the integer input provided by the user. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, but after the code execution, `n` will be a string. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**
