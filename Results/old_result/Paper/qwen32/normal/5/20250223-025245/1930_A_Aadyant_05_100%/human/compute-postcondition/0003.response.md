The code snippet provided initializes a variable `s` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `final`) are modified by this statement. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `final` is an empty list; `s` is 0.**
