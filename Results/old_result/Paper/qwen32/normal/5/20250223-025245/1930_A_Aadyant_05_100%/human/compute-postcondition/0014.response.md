Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, `a` is a string input by the user, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `n` and the integer value of `str`, `b` is a non-empty string input by the user that contains at least one substring separated by whitespace or is a single non-empty substring, `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace and must have at least one element, `str` is the next substring in `list1`**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `str` to `list2`. Therefore, `list2` now contains the integer value of `n` and the integer value of `str`. All other variables remain unchanged.
