The code snippet sets `list2` to an empty list. This affects the variable `list2` only, while all other variables retain their previous values and states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50; `a` is a string input by the user; `final` is a list containing the value of `s`; `s` is 0; `b` is a non-empty string input by the user; `list2` is an empty list; `num` is `num + 1`**.
