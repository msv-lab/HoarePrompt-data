The code snippet `s = s + int(list2[i])` modifies the variable `s` by adding the integer value of `list2[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code.

Given the initial state, `s` is the integer value of `list2[i]`. After the code execution, `s` becomes the sum of its previous value and the integer value of `list2[i]`. This means `s` effectively doubles its value if `list2[i]` is the same as the initial `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is a string representation of an integer input by the user such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 50, `a` is a string input by the user, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`, `s` is the integer value of `list2[i]` plus the previous value of `s`, `b` is a non-empty string input by the user, `list2` is a sorted list containing the integer values of all substrings from `b` split by whitespace and must have at least one element, `num` is `num + 1`, `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` split by whitespace, `i` is `i + 2`**.
