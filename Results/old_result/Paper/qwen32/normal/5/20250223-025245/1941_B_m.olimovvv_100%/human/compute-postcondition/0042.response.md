Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the new state after the code executes.

Initial State:
- `a` is at least 2
- `i` is 1
- `b[0]` is 0
- `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]` (which simplifies to `b[1]` because `b[0]` is 0)
- `b[2]` is `b[2] + 3 * b[0] - 2 * b[1]` (which simplifies to `b[2] - 2 * b[1]` because `b[0]` is 0)

Code snippet:
```
b[i + 2] -= b[i]
```

Given `i` is 1, the code modifies `b[3]` by subtracting `b[1]` from it.

So, the new value of `b[3]` is `b[3] - b[1]`.

The output state, keeping all other conditions the same:
- `a` is still at least 2
- `i` is still 1
- `b[0]` is still 0
- `b[1]` remains unchanged as `b[1]`
- `b[2]` remains unchanged as `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`
- `b[3]` is now `b[3] - b[1]`

Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is `b[1]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`, `b[3]` is `b[3] - b[1]`**.
