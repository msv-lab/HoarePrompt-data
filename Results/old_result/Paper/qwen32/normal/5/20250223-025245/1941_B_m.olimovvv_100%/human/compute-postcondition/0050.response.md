The code `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets `b[i]` to 0 because any value minus itself is 0. Given that `i` is 2, `b[2]` will be set to 0. The values of `b[0]`, `b[1]`, `b[3]`, and `b[4]` remain unchanged by this operation. The initial state specifies that `a` is at least 4, and this condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` is 0, `b[3]` is `b[3] - 2 * b[2]`, `b[4]` is `b[4] - (b[2] - 2 * b[1])`**.
