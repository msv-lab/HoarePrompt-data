Let's analyze the given task step by step:

**Initial State:**
- `a` must be at least 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `b[0]` is less than 0.

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print('NO')
```

**Analysis:**
The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the variables `a`, `i`, or `b[0]` at all. The string `'NO'` is directly printed to the console.

**Output:**
Output: **NO**
