To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the transformations it applies to the list `b`.

### Loop Behavior Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that `t >= 1`
   - `a` is an integer greater than 2
   - `b` is a list of integers

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3` (since `range(0, a - 2)` generates indices from 0 to `a - 3`).

3. **Loop Body:**
   - For each iteration `i`:
     - If `b[i] < 0`, print 'NO' and break the loop.
     - Otherwise, update `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`.
     - Set `b[i] -= b[i]`, which means `b[i]` becomes 0.

4. **Post-Loop Condition:**
   - If the loop completes without breaking, check if `b[-1] != 0` or `b[-2] != 0`. If either condition is true, print 'NO'. Otherwise, print 'YES'.

### Output State Analysis:
- **After 1st Iteration:**
  - `b[0]` becomes 0.
  - `b[1]` is decreased by `2 * b[0]` (which remains unchanged since `b[0]` is 0).
  - `b[2]` is decreased by `b[0]` (which remains unchanged since `b[0]` is 0).

- **After 2nd Iteration:**
  - `b[1]` becomes 0.
  - `b[2]` is decreased by `2 * b[1]` (which remains unchanged since `b[1]` is 0).
  - `b[3]` is decreased by `b[1]` (which remains unchanged since `b[1]` is 0).

- **After 3rd Iteration:**
  - `b[2]` becomes 0.
  - `b[3]` is decreased by `2 * b[2]` (which remains unchanged since `b[2]` is 0).
  - `b[4]` is decreased by `b[2]` (which remains unchanged since `b[2]` is 0).

### General Pattern:
- For each iteration `i`, `b[i]` is set to 0, and the subsequent elements `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` are adjusted based on the value of `b[i]` before it was set to 0.
- The loop will continue until `i` reaches `a - 3`, meaning the first `a - 2` elements of `b` will be set to 0, and adjustments will be made to the subsequent elements.

### Final State:
- After the loop completes:
  - The first `a - 2` elements of `b` are all 0.
  - The last two elements, `b[-2]` and `b[-1]`, will be checked to see if they are 0. If they are, the output is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute `a - 2` times if `a > 2` and no negative values are encountered.
- The final state of `b` will have the first `a - 2` elements as 0, and the last two elements will determine the final output.

### Final Output State:
- If `b[-2]` and `b[-1]` are both 0, the output will be 'YES'.
- Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'.

Given the constraints and the transformations, the final state of the list `b` and the corresponding output can be described as:

Output State: **The first `a - 2` elements of `b` are 0, and the output is 'YES' if `b[-2]` and `b[-1]` are both 0; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.**
