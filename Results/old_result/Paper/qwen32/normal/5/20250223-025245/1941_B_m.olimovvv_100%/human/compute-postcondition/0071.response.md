The given initial state provides information about the relationship between `a` and `i`, specifically that `a` is greater than `i + 2`, and it also mentions that `i` is being incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`). However, the print statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `a` and `i` do not influence the output of this print statement because the string `'NO'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
