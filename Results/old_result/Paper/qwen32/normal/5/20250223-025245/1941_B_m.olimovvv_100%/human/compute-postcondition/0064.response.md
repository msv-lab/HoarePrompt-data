The given initial state describes the conditions and relationships between variables `a` and `i`. Specifically, it states that `a` is greater than `i + 2` and that `i` is being incremented by 1 (i.e., `i = i + 1`). However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on the values of `a` or `i`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement is independent of the values of `a` and `i`, the output will be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
