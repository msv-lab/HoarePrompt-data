The provided Python code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores the result in the list `p`. This operation introduces a new variable `p` into the program state, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs > maxb` holds. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.**
