You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a sequence of positions and associated values. For each test case, it determines the winner between 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' based on the maximum possible accumulated value they can achieve by moving through the sequence according to specific rules, or it declares a draw if their maximum possible accumulated values are equal.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding
The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start from different positions in a permutation and move according to the rules of the game. The goal is to determine who has the higher score after `k` turns, where each turn involves collecting points from the current position and then either staying or moving to the next position in the permutation.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps` (length of permutation, number of turns, Bodya's starting position, Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first checks if the scores at Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions are equal to the maximum score in the array `a`. If so, it outputs "Draw".
   - If only Bodya's starting position has the maximum score, it outputs "Bodya".
   - If only Sasha's starting position has the maximum score, it outputs "Sasha".

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - For each turn, it checks if Bodya or Sasha has reached a position with the maximum score (`maxa`). If so, it marks that player as `found` and adds the maximum score for the remaining turns.
   - If neither player has reached the maximum score, it adds the score at the current position to the respective player's score and moves the player to the next position in the permutation.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It then calculates the potential scores for each player if they stay at their current position for the remaining turns.
   - It finds the maximum potential score for each player.

5. **Determine Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum potential scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It outputs "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Handling Maximum Scores at Start:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha have the maximum score in `a`.

- **Simulation of Moves:**
  - The program correctly simulates the movements and scoring for each player up to `k` turns.
  - It correctly handles the case where a player reaches a position with the maximum score and stays there for the remaining turns.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The program calculates the cumulative scores and potential scores correctly.
  - It correctly determines the winner based on the maximum potential scores.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and calculates the scores accurately.
