Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `foundb` and `founds` are both true; `b` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`; `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
