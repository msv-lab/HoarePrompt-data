The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element at index `ps - 1` of the list `a` to the list `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb`, and `i` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code. Since the code only modifies the list `s`, the new state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]` and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is set to True. If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the conditions related to `foundb` and `founds` and the updates to `b`, `s`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as described in the precondition. `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.**
