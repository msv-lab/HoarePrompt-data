The code snippet `s.append(maxa)` modifies the list `s` by adding the value of `maxa` to the end of the list. 

Given the initial state, if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, `s` is initially `[-maxa]`. After appending `maxa`, `s` becomes `[-maxa, maxa]`. If either `foundb` or `founds` is False, the initial value of `s` is recalculated based on the new conditions, but the only change we are certain about is the appending of `maxa` to `s`.

Since the exact initial value of `s` is not specified when `foundb` and `founds` are not both True, we can only definitively state the change to `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is True; `foundb` is False or True; `b` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `b` is recalculated based on the new conditions; `s` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is recalculated based on the new conditions with `maxa` appended; `i` is `k`; `preb` is `[-maxa, 0]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `preb` is recalculated based on the new `b`; `pres` is `[-maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `pres` is recalculated based on the new `s`; `sb` is `0` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `sb` is recalculated based on the new `b`; `ss` is `-maxa` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `ss` is recalculated based on the new `s`; `ptsb` is recalculated based on the new `preb` and `b`; `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres` and `s`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True; If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
