The given code snippet converts the string variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` into integers. The initial state specifies that these variables are strings obtained by splitting an input line. After the execution of the code, these variables will hold integer values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers obtained by converting the previously split input strings to integers.**

In simpler terms, `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 10,000. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers instead of strings.
