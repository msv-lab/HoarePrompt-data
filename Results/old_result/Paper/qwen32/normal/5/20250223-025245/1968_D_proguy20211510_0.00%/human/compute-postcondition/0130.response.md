Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[k - 1] + 0 * b[k - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list containing `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[k - 1] + 0 * s[k - 1]]`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. Additionally, `maxs` is greater than or equal to `maxb`.**
