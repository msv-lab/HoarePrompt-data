Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0. If `founds` is true, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. If `foundb` is true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `founds` is true and `foundb` is true, `b` and `s` each include an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. If `foundb` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is false, `s` includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.**
