The code snippet `b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)` appends a new element to the list `b`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1
- `pb` and `ps` are integers
- `p` is a list of integers
- `a` is a list of integers
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`
- `founds` is a boolean
- `foundb` is a boolean
- `b` is a list of integers
- `s` is a list of integers
- `i` is an integer
- `preb` is a list of integers
- `pres` is a list of integers
- `sb` is an integer
- `ss` is an integer
- `ptsb` is a list of integers
- `ptss` is a list of integers
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`

The only variable that changes is `b`, as a new element is appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

The new element to be appended to `b` is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is a boolean; `foundb` is a boolean; `b` is a list of integers with an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended; `s` is a list of integers; `i` is an integer; `preb` is a list of integers; `pres` is a list of integers; `sb` is an integer; `ss` is an integer; `ptsb` is a list of integers; `ptss` is a list of integers; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.**
