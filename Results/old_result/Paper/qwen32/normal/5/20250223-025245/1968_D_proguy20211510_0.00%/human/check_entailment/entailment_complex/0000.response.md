### Reasoning:
The program attempts to determine the winner of the game by simulating the moves of Bodya and Sasha for up to `k` turns. Here's a breakdown of the logic and potential issues:

1. **Identifying the Maximum Value in `a`:** 
   - The program first identifies the maximum value in the array `a`. If both players start on this maximum value, it immediately declares a draw. If only one player starts on this maximum value, that player is declared the winner. This is a correct approach because if a player starts on the maximum value, they can always achieve at least this score, and the other player cannot surpass it unless they also start on the same maximum value.

2. **Simulating Moves:**
   - The program then simulates the moves for both players for up to `k` turns. It keeps track of the scores and positions of both players. If either player reaches the maximum value during the simulation, the program stops further simulation for that player and assumes they will stay on the maximum value for the remaining turns. This is also a correct approach because once a player reaches the maximum value, staying on it is optimal.

3. **Calculating Scores:**
   - The program calculates the total scores for both players by summing up their scores for each turn and adding the maximum value for the remaining turns if they reach it. It then compares the total scores to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles large values of `k` by stopping the simulation once a player reaches the maximum value, which is efficient. It also correctly handles the case where both players start on the maximum value, leading to a draw.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the correct result for each test case based on the simulated scores.

### Correctness:
The program's logic is sound and correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. It efficiently handles the constraints and edge cases, and the output matches the expected results for the provided examples.

**Correctness: True**
