The provided Python code snippet only initializes a string variable `alpha` with the lowercase English alphabet. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, and P_S are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; p is a list of n integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for all 1 <= i <= n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; the sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `YES` is 'YES'; `NO` is 'NO'; `MOD` is 1000000007; `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.
