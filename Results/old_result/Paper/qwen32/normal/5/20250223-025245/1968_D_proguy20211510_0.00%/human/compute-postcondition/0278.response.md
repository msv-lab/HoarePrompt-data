Postcondition: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b` (now an empty list), `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b` (now 0), `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]` (now an empty list), `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` (now undefined since `ptsb` is empty), `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True`. Additionally, `maxs > maxb` or `maxs <= maxb` holds, and if `a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, the conditions specified in the if part hold for `a[pb - 1]`. No additional changes occur based on the else part if neither `a[pb - 1]` nor `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`. The current state of the program is that both `foundb` and `founds` are True, allowing the execution of the if block.**
