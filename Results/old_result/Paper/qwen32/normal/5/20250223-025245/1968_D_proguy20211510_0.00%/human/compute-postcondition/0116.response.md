The code snippet `rem = k - (i + 1)` calculates the value of `rem` based on the current values of `k` and `i`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k - 1`. Substituting `i` with `k - 1` in the equation, we get `rem = k - ((k - 1) + 1)`, which simplifies to `rem = k - k`, and thus `rem` becomes `0`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k - 1`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[k - 1]`; `ptss` is a list containing `pres[k - 1]`; `rem` is 0.**
