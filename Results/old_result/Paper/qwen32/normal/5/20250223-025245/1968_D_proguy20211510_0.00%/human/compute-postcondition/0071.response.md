Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1. If `foundb` is true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` includes an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `s` includes additional elements `(k - 1) * maxa` and `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is true and `founds` is false, `b` includes an additional element `maxa` and now includes `a[pb - 1]` at the end. If `foundb` is false and `founds` is true, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa` and `s` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `founds` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`; `s` includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to True and `b` includes `a[pb - 1]` at the end. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `b` includes `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to True and `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. Otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.**
