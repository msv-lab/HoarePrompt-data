In the provided for loop, the loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program in any meaningful way. The number of iterations is determined by the input value, which is not a variable in the loop head but rather a condition for the loop to execute.

Given the task, we need to adjust the state based on the loop head, but since the loop head does not contain any variables that need to be modified for the loop to continue, the state of the program does not change with respect to the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[k - 1] + 0 * b[k - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list containing `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[k - 1] + 0 * s[k - 1]]`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, the current value of `maxs` is greater than the current value of `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.**
