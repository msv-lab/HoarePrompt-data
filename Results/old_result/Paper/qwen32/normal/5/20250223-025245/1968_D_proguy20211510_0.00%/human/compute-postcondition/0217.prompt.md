Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is False; `foundb` is False; `b` and `s` are now empty lists; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[k - 1] + 0 * b[k - 1]]`; `ptss` is a list containing `[pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1], ..., pres[k - 1] + 0 * s[k - 1]]`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `founds` is True, then `b` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `b` is recalculated based on the new conditions; `s` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is recalculated based on the new conditions with `maxa` appended; `i` is `k`; `preb` is `[-maxa, 0]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `preb` is recalculated based on the new `b`; `pres` is `[-maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `pres` is recalculated based on the new `s`; `sb` is `0` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `sb` is recalculated based on the new `b`; `ss` is `-maxa` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `ss` is recalculated based on the new `s`; `ptsb` is recalculated based on the new `preb` and `b`; `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres` and `s`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True. If `founds` is False, then if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` becomes True and `s` is `[-maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is the previous elements of `s` plus `maxa`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `founds` remains False and `s` is `[-maxa, a[ps - 1]]` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise `s` is the previous elements of `s` plus `a[ps - 1]`. The values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s` if `foundb` is True and `founds` is True, otherwise they are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s` if `foundb` is True, otherwise they retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `founds` is True, `s` includes the element `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to True, and `founds` is True, `b` is `[-maxa, maxa, a[pb - 1]]` or `[-maxa, maxa, maxa]`, `s` is `[-maxa, maxa, a[pb - 1]]` or `[-maxa, maxa, maxa]`, `i` is `k`, `preb` is `[-maxa, 0]`, `pres` is `[-maxa]`, `sb` is `0`, `ss` is `-maxa`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are recalculated based on the new `preb`, `b`, `pres`, and `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `founds` is True, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is False, `b` and `s` are recalculated based on the new conditions, `i` is `k`, `preb` and `pres` are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s`, `sb` and `ss` are recalculated based on the new `b` and `s`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are recalculated based on the new `preb`, `b`, `pres`, and `s`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `foundb` is True, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `foundb` is True. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is True, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`, and the values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the new conditions. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is False, the values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` retain their previous values. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is set to True, and `foundb` is True, `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are recalculated based on the new `founds` value. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `founds` remains unchanged, and `ps` is set to `p[ps - 1]`. The values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` retain their previous values if `foundb` is False. If `foundb` is True, these values are recalculated based on the new conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is a boolean; `foundb` is a boolean; `b` is a list of integers; `s` is a list of integers. If `founds` is True, `s` has an additional element `maxa` appended; otherwise, `s` has an additional element `a[ps - 1]` appended. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is True, `founds` remains True; otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. The values of `b`, `i`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` retain their previous values unless `founds` is True, in which case `s` is updated as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
