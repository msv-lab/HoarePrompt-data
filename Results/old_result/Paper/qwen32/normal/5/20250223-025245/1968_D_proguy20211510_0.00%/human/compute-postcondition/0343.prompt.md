Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b` (now an empty list), `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b` (now 0), `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]` (now an empty list), `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` (now undefined since `ptsb` is empty), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs > maxb` holds. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, the conditions specified in the if part hold for `a[pb - 1]`. No additional changes occur based on the else part if neither `a[pb - 1]` nor `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`. `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is False, `foundb` is False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `sb` is 0, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s` plus `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `ss` is `a[ps - 1]`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]` if `founds` is True, otherwise `ptss` is a list containing `k * a[ps - 1]`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `maxb` is undefined, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list containing `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` and `foundb` is False, `s` is a list containing `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `s` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]`, and `founds` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `sb` is 0, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s` plus `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `ss` is `a[ps - 1]`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]` if `founds` is True, otherwise `ptss` is a list containing `k * a[ps - 1]`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `maxb` is undefined, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list containing `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` and `foundb` is False, and `s` is a list containing `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `s` is a list containing `a[ps - 1], maxa`. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, then `b` contains an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `founds` is True, `ptss` is updated based on the cumulative sums of `s` plus the respective multipliers. If `founds` is False, `pres` and `ptss` are updated based on the value of `a[ps - 1]` and `maxa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `sb` is 0, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s` plus `maxa` if `founds` is True, otherwise `ss` is `a[ps - 1]`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]` if `founds` is True, otherwise `ptss` is a list containing `k * a[ps - 1]`, `i` is `len(pres) + 1`, `rem` is `k - (len(pres) + 1)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `maxb` is undefined, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list containing `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]` plus an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` and `foundb` is False, and `s` is a list containing `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]` plus the new element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` if `foundb` and `founds` are True, otherwise `s` is a list containing `a[ps - 1], maxa`, plus the new element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is True and `b` contains an additional element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are True, `s` has an additional element `maxa` appended to it. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]` and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa` and `foundb` and `founds` are True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
