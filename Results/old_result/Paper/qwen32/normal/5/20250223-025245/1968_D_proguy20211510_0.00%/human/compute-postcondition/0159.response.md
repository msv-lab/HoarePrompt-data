Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is False or True; `foundb` is False; `b` and `s` are lists, where if `founds` is True, `b` and `s` each contain `[-maxa]`; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index, recalculated if `founds` is True; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index, recalculated if `founds` is True; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, updated to `-maxa` if `founds` is True; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, updated to `-maxa` if `founds` is True; `ptsb` is a list containing recalculated values based on the new `preb` and `b` if `founds` is True; `ptss` is a list containing recalculated values based on the new `pres` and `s` if `founds` is True; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, recalculated if `founds` is True; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated if `founds` is True.**
