The code snippet appends `maxa` to the list `s`. This affects the list `s` directly, and since `s` is used to calculate `pres` and `ptss`, these lists will also be affected. However, the specific values of `pres` and `ptss` are not recalculated in the given code snippet, so they remain as they were before the append operation. The variable `ss`, which is the sum of all elements in `s`, will also increase by `maxa` due to the append operation.

Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` with at least `len(pres)` elements, `sb` is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` since `foundb` and `founds` are True, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s` plus `maxa`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + (k-1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k-2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * b[len(pres)-1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + (k-1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k-2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres)-1] + (k-len(pres)) * s[len(pres)-1]`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` since `foundb` is True, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list containing `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]` since `foundb` and `founds` are True, `s` is a list containing `[(k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]` since `foundb` and `founds` are True, and `founds` is True.**
