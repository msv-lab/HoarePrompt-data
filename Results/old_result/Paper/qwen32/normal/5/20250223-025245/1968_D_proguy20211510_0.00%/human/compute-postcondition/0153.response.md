The code snippet appends a new value to the list `b`. The new value is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k`, so the expression simplifies to `(k - (k + 1)) * maxa`, which is `-1 * maxa` or simply `-maxa`.

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `b` now contains one additional element: `-maxa`.
- `preb` and `pres` are cumulative sums of `b` and `s`, respectively. Since `b` has a new element, `preb` will be recalculated to include this new element.
- `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, and since `b` now includes `-maxa`, `sb` will be updated to reflect this.
- `ptsb` is a list that depends on `preb` and `b`. Since `preb` is recalculated, `ptsb` will also be recalculated.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, and it might change based on the new `ptsb` values.
- `founds` and `foundb` remain `True` as per the initial state.
- `maxs` and `ptss` remain unchanged as `s` has not been modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1; `pb` and `ps` are integers; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `founds` is True; `foundb` is True; `b` is a list containing `[-maxa]`; `s` is an empty list; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index, recalculated to include `-maxa`; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, updated to `-maxa`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing recalculated values based on the new `preb` and `b`; `ptss` is a list containing recalculated values based on `pres` and `s`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, recalculated.**
