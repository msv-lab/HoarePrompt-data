The `continue` statement in Python skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. However, since no loop is explicitly mentioned in the given context, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the flow of the program in this specific snippet. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`) are altered.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers obtained by converting the previously split input strings to integers; `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. The current value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`. It is not the case that `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**
