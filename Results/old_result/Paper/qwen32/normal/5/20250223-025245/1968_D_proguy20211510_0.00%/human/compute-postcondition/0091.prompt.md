Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers obtained by converting the previously split input strings to integers; `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the newly split input strings to integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are both equal to `maxa`, then the condition is true. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` remains unchanged, whether or not it is equal to `maxa`. `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list; `founds` is False, `foundb` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0. If `founds` is true, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. If `foundb` is true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `founds` is true and `foundb` is true, `b` and `s` each include an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. If `foundb` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is false, `s` includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1. If `foundb` is true, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` includes an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `s` includes additional elements `(k - 1) * maxa` and `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is true and `founds` is false, `b` includes an additional element `maxa` and now includes `a[pb - 1]` at the end. If `foundb` is false and `founds` is true, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa` and `s` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `founds` is false, `b` includes the element `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`; `s` includes the element `a[ps - 1]` at the end, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to True and `b` includes `a[pb - 1]` at the end. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `b` includes `a[pb - 1]` at the end, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to True and `s` includes an additional element `(k - 1) * maxa`. Otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2. If `founds` is True, `s` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `founds` is set to True and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]` and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is set to True. If both `foundb` and `founds` are True, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the conditions related to `foundb` and `founds` and the updates to `b`, `s`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as described in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
