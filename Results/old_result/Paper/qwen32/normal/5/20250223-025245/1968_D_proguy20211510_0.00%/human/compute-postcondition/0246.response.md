The code snippet updates the value of `rem` based on the new formula `k - (i + 1)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Substituting `i` into the formula, we get `rem = k - (2 + 1)`, which simplifies to `rem = k - 3`.

Output State: **`preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 2 elements, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[0] + rem * b[0]` and `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[0] + rem * s[0]` and `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`, `i` is 2, `rem` is `k - 3`**.
