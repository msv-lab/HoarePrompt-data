To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the given conditions and the provided output states after the first three iterations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: 
    - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
    - `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa` are given.
    - `b` and `s` are initially empty lists.
    - `founds` and `foundb` are initially `False`.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
    - The loop runs `k` times.
    - For each iteration `i`:
        - If `foundb` and `founds` are `True`, the loop breaks, and both `b` and `s` append `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.
        - If `foundb` is `True`, `b` appends `maxa`.
        - If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to `True`, and `b` appends `a[pb - 1]`.
        - Otherwise, `b` appends `a[pb - 1]`, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
        - If `founds` is `True`, `s` appends `maxa`.
        - If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to `True`, and `s` appends `a[ps - 1]`.
        - Otherwise, `s` appends `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.

3. **Output State after All Iterations**:
    - The loop will run until `k` iterations are completed or until both `foundb` and `founds` are `True`.
    - If `foundb` and `founds` become `True` during the loop, the loop breaks, and the remaining iterations are not executed.
    - If the loop completes all `k` iterations without both `foundb` and `founds` being `True`, `b` and `s` will have accumulated the values according to the conditions described in the loop.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- If `foundb` and `founds` are `True` at any point, the loop breaks, and the final state is determined by the values of `b` and `s` up to that point.
- If the loop completes all `k` iterations, `b` and `s` will have `k` elements each, with the values determined by the conditions in the loop.

Let's assume the loop completes all `k` iterations without both `foundb` and `founds` being `True`. The final state will be:

- `b` will have `k` elements, where each element is either `maxa` if `foundb` is `True` or the value of `a[pb - 1]` otherwise, with `pb` being updated accordingly.
- `s` will have `k` elements, where each element is either `maxa` if `founds` is `True` or the value of `a[ps - 1]` otherwise, with `ps` being updated accordingly.
- `i` will be `k - 1` (the last iteration index).

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations, the lists `b` and `s` will each contain `k` elements, where each element is either `maxa` if the corresponding condition (`foundb` for `b` and `founds` for `s`) is `True`, or the value of `a[pb - 1]` or `a[ps - 1]` respectively, with `pb` and `ps` updated as specified in the loop. The variable `i` will be the last index of the loop, which is `k - 1`.
