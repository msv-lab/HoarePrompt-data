Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `k` must be greater than 0; `i` is 2. `b` includes an additional element `maxa`. If `foundb` and `founds` are true, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions related to `foundb` and `founds` and the updates to `b`, `s`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as described in the precondition.**

In natural language: The list `b` now includes an additional element with the value `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `foundb` and `founds` still apply as described in the initial state.
