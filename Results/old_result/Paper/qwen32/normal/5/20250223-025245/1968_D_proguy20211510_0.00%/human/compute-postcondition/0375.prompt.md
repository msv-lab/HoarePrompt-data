Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `preb` is a list containing the elements `[sb + b[0], sb + b[0] + b[1], ..., sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1]]`, `pres` is a list containing the elements `[ss + s[0], ss + s[0] + s[1], ..., ss + s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[len(s) - 1]]`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `rem` is `0`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions, `s` contains at least one element, and `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pres)):
    rem = k - (i + 1)
    ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
    ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `preb` is a list containing the elements `[sb + b[0], sb + b[0] + b[1], ..., sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1]]`, `pres` is a list containing at least one element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the element `preb[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * b[len(s) - 1]`, `ptss` is a list containing the element `pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * s[len(s) - 1]`, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(s)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions, `s` contains at least one element, and `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `preb` is a list containing the elements `[sb + b[0], sb + b[0] + b[1], ..., sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1]]`, `pres` is a list containing at least one element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * b[len(s) - 1]` and `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * s[len(s) - 1]` and `pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - (len(s) + 1)) * s[len(s) - 1]`, `i` is `len(s)`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions, `s` contains at least one element, and `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `preb` is a list containing the elements `[sb + b[0], sb + b[0] + b[1], ..., sb + b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[len(s) - 1]]`; `pres` is a list containing at least one element; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing the elements `preb[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * b[len(s) - 1]`, `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, and `preb[len(s) + 1] + (k - (len(s) + 2)) * b[len(s) + 1]`; `ptss` is a list containing the elements `pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - len(s)) * s[len(s) - 1]`, `pres[len(s) - 1] + (k - (len(s) + 1)) * s[len(s) - 1]`, and `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`; `i` is `len(s) + 1`; `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`; `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`; `b` contains up to `k` elements where `maxa` is appended based on conditions; `s` contains at least one element; `founds` is True if `maxa` was found in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
