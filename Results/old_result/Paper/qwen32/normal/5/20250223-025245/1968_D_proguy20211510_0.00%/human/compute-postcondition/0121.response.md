The code snippet appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k`, and `rem` is `-1`. Therefore, the new value being appended to `ptsb` is `preb[k] + (-1) * b[k]`, which simplifies to `preb[k] - b[k]`.

Since `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index, `preb[k]` is the sum of all elements in `b` up to and including the `k`-th element. Subtracting `b[k]` from `preb[k]` effectively removes the `k`-th element from the cumulative sum, resulting in the sum of all elements in `b` up to but not including the `k`-th element.

Given the initial state, `ptsb` already contains two elements: `preb[k - 1]` and `preb[k - 1]`. After executing the code snippet, `ptsb` will contain three elements: `preb[k - 1]`, `preb[k - 1]`, and `preb[k] - b[k]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `founds`, `foundb` are as given; `b` and `s` are lists of length `k` with values determined by the loop conditions; `i` is `k`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `b` up to each index; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index; `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`; `ptsb` is a list containing `preb[k - 1], preb[k - 1], preb[k] - b[k]`; `ptss` is a list containing `pres[k - 1], pres[k - 1]`; `rem` is -1.**
