### Reasoning:

The provided solution calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) into the desired state (`s2`). The operations allowed are adding a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another.

The solution correctly identifies two key values:
- `cats_to_add`: The number of positions where a cat needs to be added (i.e., positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1').
- `cats_to_remove`: The number of positions where a cat needs to be removed (i.e., positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0').

The logic used is sound because:
- If there are more positions where cats need to be added than removed, the limiting factor is the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`).
- Conversely, if there are more positions where cats need to be removed than added, the limiting factor is the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`).
- If the number of cats to be added and removed are equal, then the number of operations will be equal to either of these values.

Thus, the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` gives the minimum number of days required to achieve the desired configuration. This is because any move operation can be considered as a combination of a remove and an add operation, but the number of add or remove operations cannot be reduced below the maximum of the two.

### Correctness: **True**
