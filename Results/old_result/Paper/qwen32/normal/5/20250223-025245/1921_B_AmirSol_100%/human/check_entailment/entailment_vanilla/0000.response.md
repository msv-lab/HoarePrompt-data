### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Initial State (s1):** A string of length `n` where each character is either '1' (indicating a cat is present) or '0' (indicating no cat is present).
- **Final State (s2):** Another string of length `n` with the same format, representing the desired distribution of cats.
- **Operations:**
  1. Add a cat to a box (change '0' to '1').
  2. Remove a cat from a box (change '1' to '0').
  3. Move a cat from one box to another (change '1' to '0' and another '0' to '1').

#### Objective:
Find the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the final state `s2`.

#### Solution Analysis:
- **Cats to Add (`cats_to_add`):** This is the number of positions where there is no cat in the initial state (`s1[i] == '0'`) but there should be a cat in the final state (`s2[i] == '1'`). This represents the number of new cats that need to be added.
- **Cats to Remove (`cats_to_remove`):** This is the number of positions where there is a cat in the initial state (`s1[i] == '1'`) but there should not be a cat in the final state (`s2[i] == '0'`). This represents the number of cats that need to be removed.

The key insight is that the minimum number of operations required is the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. Here's why:
- If `cats_to_add` is greater than `cats_to_remove`, you need to add more cats than you can remove, so the limiting factor is adding cats.
- If `cats_to_remove` is greater than `cats_to_add`, you need to remove more cats than you can add, so the limiting factor is removing cats.
- If they are equal, the number of operations required is simply the value of either `cats_to_add` or `cats_to_remove`.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` and returns `max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)`, which is the minimum number of operations required.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the solution with the first test case from the example:

- **Initial State (`s1`):** `10010`
- **Final State (`s2`):** `00001`
- **Cats to Add:** Positions 4 (0-indexed) need a cat, so `cats_to_add = 1`.
- **Cats to Remove:** Positions 0 and 3 have cats that need to be removed, so `cats_to_remove = 2`.
- **Minimum Operations:** `max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove) = max(1, 2) = 2`.

This matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the final state by determining the maximum of the cats that need to be added and the cats that need to be removed.

**Correctness: True**
