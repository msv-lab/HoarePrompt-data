### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze the logic behind the function `func_1` and see if it accurately calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the final state `s2`.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` boxes, each either containing a cat ('1') or not ('0').
   - We need to transform the initial state `s1` into the final state `s2` using the minimum number of operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Adding a cat to an empty box.
     - Removing a cat from a box.
     - Moving a cat from one box to another.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The problem can be simplified by focusing on the mismatches between `s1` and `s2`.
   - Specifically, we need to count:
     - The number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1' (`cats_to_add`).
     - The number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' (`cats_to_remove`).
   - The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two counts because:
     - If `cats_to_add` is greater, we need to add more cats than we can remove, so the limiting factor is the number of additions.
     - If `cats_to_remove` is greater, we need to remove more cats than we can add, so the limiting factor is the number of removals.
     - If they are equal, we can balance additions and removals.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` using list comprehensions.
   - It then returns the maximum of these two values, which aligns with the key insight above.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` into `s2`.
   - The program is correct.
