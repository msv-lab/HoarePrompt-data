Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`.**

Here, `cats_to_add` is the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', and `cats_to_remove` is the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. The program returns whichever of these two counts is larger.
