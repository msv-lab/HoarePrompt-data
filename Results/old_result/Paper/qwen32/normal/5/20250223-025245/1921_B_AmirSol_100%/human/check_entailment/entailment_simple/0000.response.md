### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) into the desired state (`s2`). The allowed operations are:

1. Adding a cat to an empty box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The key insight is that the number of operations needed is determined by the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two values because:

- You can move cats around freely, so if you need to add a cat to a box and remove a cat from another, you can do this in one operation by moving the cat.
- However, if you need to add more cats than you need to remove, you'll need to add the extra cats, and vice versa.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` by iterating through the strings `s1` and `s2` and counting the positions where a cat needs to be added or removed. The function then returns the maximum of these two counts, which is the correct minimum number of operations required.
