Let's break down the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program takes a single line of input `n` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `d` and sets `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and calculates the prefix balance for each position `i + 1` based on whether the character at `s[i]` is `(` or `)`.
     - If `s[i] == '('`, the balance increases by 1.
     - If `s[i] == ')'`, the balance decreases by 1.
   - After the loop, it removes the last entry `d.pop(n)` which is unnecessary as it simply removes the balance after the last character, which is not used in the sorting or output.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The dictionary `d` is converted to a list of tuples and sorted based on the balance (`x[1]`) in increasing order. In case of ties (same balance), it sorts by the position (`-x[0]`) in decreasing order.
   - This sorting ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Reconstructing the Shuffled Sequence**:
   - It initializes an empty string `ans`.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of tuples and appends the character `s[i]` to `ans` for each tuple `(i, j)`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` returns the shuffled sequence `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

- The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position.
- It sorts the characters based on the prefix balance and position as specified.
- The sorted characters are then used to form the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
