The code snippet `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` initially contains the character at index `i` of `s`. After the operation, `ans` will contain the character at index `i` of `s` twice.

Here is the Output State:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the character at index `i` of `s` repeated twice; `d` is a list of tuples that must have at least two tuples; `i` and `j` are the second tuple in `d`.**
