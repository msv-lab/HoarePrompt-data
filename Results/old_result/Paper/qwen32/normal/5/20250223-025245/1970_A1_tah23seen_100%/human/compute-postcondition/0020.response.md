The code sorts the dictionary `d` based on the values of its items, and in case of a tie, it sorts by the keys in descending order. The result of this sorting operation is a list of tuples, not a dictionary. Therefore, the variable `d` is now a list of tuples rather than a dictionary.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the values of the original dictionary items, and in case of a tie, by the keys in descending order.**
