Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in the way it calculates the prefix balance and constructs the final balanced shuffle sequence. Specifically, the dictionary `d` is used to store the prefix balance at each position, but the program incorrectly removes the last entry of the dictionary (`d.pop(n)`) before sorting. This removal should not be done because it discards the balance information at the last position, which is necessary for the balanced shuffle operation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    # Do not pop the last entry
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        if i != 0:  # Skip the initial position 0
            ans += s[i - 1]
    return ans

# Read input
n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

In this corrected version, the dictionary `d` is not modified after it is populated, and the loop that constructs the final sequence skips the entry at position 0. This ensures that all prefix balances are considered correctly and the balanced shuffle is computed as intended.
