The code snippet provided updates the dictionary `d` by setting `d[i + 1]` to `d[i] - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and `d[0]` is 0. Therefore, `d[1]` will be `0 - 1`, which is `-1`.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged. The character at index `i` in `s` is still ")".

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with the keys `0` and `1` and values `0` and `-1` respectively, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `s` is ")"**.
