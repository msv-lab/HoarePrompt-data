### Reasoning:

The program is designed to perform a "balanced shuffle" operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. Let's break down the steps of the program to verify its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the prefix balance for each position in the input string `s`.
   - This is done using a dictionary `d` where the keys are the positions (1-based index) and the values are the prefix balances.
   - The prefix balance is incremented by 1 for each opening parenthesis `(` and decremented by 1 for each closing parenthesis `)`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The dictionary `d` is converted to a list of tuples and sorted based on the prefix balance in increasing order.
   - If two positions have the same prefix balance, they are sorted by their position in decreasing order.

3. **Reconstruction**:
   - The sorted list of tuples is used to construct the new string `ans` by concatenating the characters from the original string `s` in the order specified by the sorted positions.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

**Input**: `(()(()))`

1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - Position 1: `(`
     - Prefix balance: 1
   - Position 2: `(`
     - Prefix balance: 2
   - Position 3: `)`
     - Prefix balance: 1
   - Position 4: `(`
     - Prefix balance: 2
   - Position 5: `(`
     - Prefix balance: 3
   - Position 6: `)`
     - Prefix balance: 2
   - Position 7: `)`
     - Prefix balance: 1
   - Position 8: `)`
     - Prefix balance: 0

   The dictionary `d` will be:
   ```python
   {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 1, 8: 0}
   ```

2. **Sorting**:
   - After removing the last entry (position 8 with balance 0), the dictionary becomes:
     ```python
     {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 1}
     ```
   - Sorting based on balance and position:
     ```python
     [(0, 0), (7, 1), (3, 1), (1, 1), (6, 2), (4, 2), (2, 2), (5, 3)]
     ```

3. **Reconstruction**:
   - Using the sorted positions to form the new string:
     - Position 0: `(`
     - Position 7: `)`
     - Position 3: `(` 
     - Position 1: `(` 
     - Position 6: `)`
     - Position 4: `(` 
     - Position 2: `)` 
     - Position 5: `)`
     
   The new string `ans` is: `()(()())`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The example provided is correctly handled, and the output matches the expected result. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
