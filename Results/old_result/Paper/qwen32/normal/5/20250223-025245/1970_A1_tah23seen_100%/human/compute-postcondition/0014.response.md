The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `s`. Since the loop iterates over the range of the length of `s`, we only need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is the string being iterated over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the keys `0` and `1`. If the character at position `1` in `s` is `(`, then the value for key `1` in `d` is `1`. If the character at position `1` in `s` is `)`, then the value for key `1` in `d` is `-1`. `i` is `2`.**
