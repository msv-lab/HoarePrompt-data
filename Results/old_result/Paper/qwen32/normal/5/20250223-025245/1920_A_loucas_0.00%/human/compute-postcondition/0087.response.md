The provided code snippet contains a `break` statement, which will exit the most internal loop or conditional block. However, the `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `num` directly. The values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `num` is `i + 1`

Since there is no change to the values of `i` and `num` due to the `break` statement, the output state will reflect the same conditions with the addition of the fact that the loop or conditional block has been exited.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `num` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
