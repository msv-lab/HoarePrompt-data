Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` remains unchanged, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `no` is an empty list, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `x` is 1, `a` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is appended to the list `big`, making `big` no longer an empty list but a list containing the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
