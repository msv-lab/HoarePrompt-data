Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input, `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is not equal to 2.**

In simple terms, the list `no` now contains the value of `a`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
