Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `innerLoop` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` and `a` are integers read from the input, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing at least one integer, `less` is a list containing at least one integer such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 1`, `num` is `max(big) + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
