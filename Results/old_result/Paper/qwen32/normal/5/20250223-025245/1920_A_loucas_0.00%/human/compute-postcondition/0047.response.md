To determine the output of the `print(num)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic behind the variable `num`.

### Initial State Analysis
1. **`big`**: This is presumably a list or some iterable containing integers. The `max(big)` function will return the maximum value from this iterable.
2. **`less`**: This is also presumably a list or some iterable containing integers. The `min(less)` function will return the minimum value from this iterable.
3. **`no`**: This is another list or iterable containing integers. We need to find the first integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not present in this list `no`.
4. **`num`**: This variable is set to the first integer in the range `[max(big), min(less))` that is not in `no`, or `0` if no such integer exists.

### Steps to Determine the Output
1. **Determine the Range**: The range in question is `[max(big), min(less))`. This means the range starts at `max(big)` and goes up to, but does not include, `min(less)`.
2. **Identify the Missing Integer**: We need to find the first integer within this range that is not in the list `no`.
3. **Default Value**: If no such integer exists in the specified range, `num` is set to `0`.

### Output Analysis
Given the initial state, we do not have the exact values of `big`, `less`, and `no`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `num`. However, we can describe the value of `num` based on the logic provided.

- If there is at least one integer in the range `[max(big), min(less))` that is not in `no`, `num` will be that integer.
- If there are no integers in the range `[max(big), min(less))` that are not in `no`, `num` will be `0`.

### Final Output
Based on the above analysis, the output of the `print(num)` statement will be the first integer in the range `[max(big), min(less))` that is not in `no`, or `0` if no such integer exists.

Output: **num (where num is the first integer in the range [max(big), min(less)) that is not in no, or 0 if no such integer exists)**
