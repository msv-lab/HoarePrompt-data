The code snippet `big.append(a)` adds the value of `a` to the list `big`. The values of `num`, `iterable`, `loop`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, and the initialization conditions for `big`, `less`, and `no` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than `iterable2`, `iterable2` is incremented by 1, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` contains the value of `a`, `less` and `no` are initialized based on the new value of `x`.**
