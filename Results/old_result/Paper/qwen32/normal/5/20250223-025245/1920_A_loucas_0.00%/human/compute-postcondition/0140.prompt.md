Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is 0; `iterable` is a valid integer; `loop` remains unchanged; `innerLoop` is a valid integer; `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1; `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2; `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is `i` if `i` is not in `no`, otherwise `num` remains 0. `iterable` is a valid integer, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` is a valid integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1 (must be non-empty), `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2 (must be non-empty and `min(less)` must be greater than `max(big)`), `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2. If `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is `i` if `i` is not in `no`, otherwise `num` remains 0. `iterable` is a valid integer, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` is a valid integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1 (must be non-empty), `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2 (must be non-empty and `min(less)` must be greater than `max(big)`), `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `i` is `i+1`. If `i` is not in `no`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is `i` if `i` is not in `no`; otherwise, `num` remains `0`. `iterable` is a valid integer, `loop` remains unchanged, `innerLoop` is a valid integer, `big` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 1 (must be non-empty), `less` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was 2 (must be non-empty and `min(less)` must be greater than `max(big)`), `no` is a list containing all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, and `i` is `i+2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
