Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it determines and prints a value of `k` that satisfies all the constraints, where constraints can specify that `k` must be greater than or equal to a value, less than or equal to a value, or not equal to a value. If no such `k` exists, it prints `0`.**
