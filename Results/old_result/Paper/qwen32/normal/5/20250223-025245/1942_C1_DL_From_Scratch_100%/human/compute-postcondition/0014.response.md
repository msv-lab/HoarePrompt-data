Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is the third integer from the input, `list0` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, `count` is either 1 or 2 if `num` is 1, otherwise `count` remains 0, `i` is `x - 2`.**
