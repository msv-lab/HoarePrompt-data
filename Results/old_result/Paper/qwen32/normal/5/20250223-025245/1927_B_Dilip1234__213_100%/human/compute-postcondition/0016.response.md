The code snippet `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is 2, so `char_count[2]` is incremented by 1.

Other variables (`n`, `a`, `s`, `char_count`) remain unchanged except for `char_count[2]`, which is now one more than it was before the operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i < n); `s` is a string with 'c' appended to it; If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is "b" and `char_count[1]` is 1, otherwise `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros; `j` is 2; `char_count[2]` is incremented by 1.**
