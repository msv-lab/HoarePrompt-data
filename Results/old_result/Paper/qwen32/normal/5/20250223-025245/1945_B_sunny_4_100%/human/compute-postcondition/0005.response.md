To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from input.
3. `ans` is defined as `m // a + m // b + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is calculated using the formula: `m // a + m // b + 2`.
- `m // a` is the integer division of `m` by `a`.
- `m // b` is the integer division of `m` by `b`.
- The result of these divisions is summed and then 2 is added to the result.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `m` by `b`, plus 2.

Given the initial state, we don't have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `m`. Therefore, the output will be described in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **m // a + m // b + 2 (where m // a is the integer division of m by a, and m // b is the integer division of m by b)**
