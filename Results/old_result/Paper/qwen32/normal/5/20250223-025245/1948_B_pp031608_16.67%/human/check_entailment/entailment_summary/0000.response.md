Reasoning: 

The provided program is intended to determine if a given list of integers can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting any number that is at least 10 into its individual digits. However, there are several issues with the given code that make it incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` is called within the loop, but it is not defined before its first usage. This will raise a `NameError`.

2. The logic for splitting numbers and checking if the list is sorted is flawed. The program attempts to check if the list is sorted after each potential split, but it does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed for a single number or when multiple numbers need to be split to achieve a sorted order.

3. The loop that checks for sorting and splitting only runs once per test case, which is insufficient to handle cases where multiple splits are required.

4. The `func_1` function is supposed to check if a list is sorted, but the execution summary incorrectly states that it checks a list excluding the first element, which is not the case in the provided code.

5. The program does not handle the case where the list is already sorted correctly.

6. The program does not account for the fact that splitting a number can change the relative order of elements in the list, and it does not re-check the entire list after each split.

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
