Reasoning: 

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **State of the program right before the function call**: The description states that `lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. However, in the main code, `list1` is created from the input without the first element being the length. The first element is `n` which is the count of integers in the list, and the subsequent `n` elements are the actual integers. So, the `func_1` function should not consider the first element as part of the list to be sorted.

2. **Logic in the for loop**: The main logic in the for loop is flawed. It checks if the list is already sorted using `func_1(list1)`. If not, it checks if the current element is greater than the next and greater than 10, and then it tries to split the current element into its digits. However, this logic is not sufficient to ensure that the list can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation. The program should continue to check and apply the operation until no more operations can be applied, and then check if the list is sorted.

3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` should ignore the first element (which is `n`) when checking if the list is sorted. Currently, it checks the entire list including `n`.

To correct the program, we need to:
- Modify `func_1` to ignore the first element.
- Ensure that the main loop continues to apply the operation until no more operations can be applied.
- Check if the list (excluding the first element) is sorted after all possible operations.

Given these issues, the current program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
