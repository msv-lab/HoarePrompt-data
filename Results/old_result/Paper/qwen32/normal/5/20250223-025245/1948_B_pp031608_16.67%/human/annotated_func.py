#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of lst is between 2 and 50 inclusive. This list represents the array a for a single test case, with the first element of lst being the integer n (the length of the array), followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers where the first element is the length of the list, and the subsequent elements are integers between 0 and 99. It returns `True` if the list (excluding the first element) is sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns `False`.
