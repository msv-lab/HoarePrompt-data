Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` is called before it is defined**: In Python, functions must be defined before they are called. The program calls `func_1` before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Logic for splitting numbers**: The program does not correctly handle the splitting of numbers that are at least 10. The logic for splitting numbers and checking the sorted order is flawed. Specifically:
   - The program checks if the list is sorted before attempting to split any number, which is incorrect because the list might become sorted after splitting a number.
   - The program only checks the condition `if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10` and splits the number at position `p-1`. This is not sufficient to handle all cases where the list can be sorted by splitting numbers.

3. **Handling of splitting numbers**: The program only splits the number into two parts (tens and units), but it should handle numbers with more than two digits correctly.

4. **Infinite loop risk**: The program does not guarantee that it will terminate if the list cannot be sorted. It might enter an infinite loop if it repeatedly tries to split numbers without achieving a sorted list.

To correct the program, you would need to:
- Define `func_1` before using it.
- Implement a more robust algorithm to handle the splitting of numbers and check the sorted order.
- Ensure that the program terminates correctly and provides the right output for all test cases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst

def can_be_sorted(lst):
    while not func_1(lst):
        changed = False
        for i in range(len(lst)):
            if lst[i] >= 10:
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(lst[i])]
                lst = lst[:i] + digits + lst[i+1:]
                changed = True
                break
        if not changed:
            return False
    return True

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version defines the necessary functions and implements a more robust algorithm to handle the splitting of numbers and checking the sorted order.
