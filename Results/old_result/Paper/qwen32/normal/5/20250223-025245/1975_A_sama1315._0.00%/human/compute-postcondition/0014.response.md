The code snippet provided attempts to reassign the value of `n` using `data[index]`. However, given the initial state, `n` is already defined as the integer value of `data[1]`. Reassigning `n` with `data[index]` would normally change its value, but since `index` is defined as `2 + n`, the reassignment is essentially `n = int(data[2 + n])`. This operation does not align with the typical usage and might be intended for a different context or might be an error.

For the purpose of this task, we will assume that the reassignment is intentional, but it will not change the logical flow as described in the initial state since `n` is already defined and used to calculate `index`.

Given that the reassignment does not logically change the state as per the initial definitions provided, the output state remains the same with `n` being the integer value of `data[1]` and `index` being `2 + n`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**
