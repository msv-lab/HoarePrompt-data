The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. The previous value of `index` was `3 + n`, so after the operation, `index` becomes `3 + n + n` or `3 + 2n`. The values of the other variables (`arr`, `data`, `t`, `n`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.
