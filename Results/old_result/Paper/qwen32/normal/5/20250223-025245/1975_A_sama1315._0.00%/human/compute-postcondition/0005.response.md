The code snippet provided simply initializes an empty list named `results`. This action does not affect the values of `arr`, `data`, `index`, or `t`. Therefore, the output state will retain the initial values of these variables, with the addition of the newly created `results` list being empty.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a positive integer from the input; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
