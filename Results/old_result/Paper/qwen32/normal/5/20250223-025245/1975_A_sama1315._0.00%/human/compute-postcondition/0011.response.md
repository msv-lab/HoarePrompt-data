Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the output state after the execution of `result = func_1(arr)`. The impact of this code snippet is that it calls the function `func_1` with the argument `arr` and assigns the return value of this function to the variable `result`. The other variables remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the provided snippet.

Here is the output state:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

This means that after the execution of the code snippet, the variable `result` holds the value returned by the function `func_1(arr)`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
