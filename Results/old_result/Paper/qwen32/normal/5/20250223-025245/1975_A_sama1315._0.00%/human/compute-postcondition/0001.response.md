Output State: **`arr` is a list of n positive integers where n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and each element in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a positive integer from the input.**

In natural language: The list `arr` remains unchanged as it was initially defined. The variable `data` is now a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a positive integer from the input, split by spaces.
