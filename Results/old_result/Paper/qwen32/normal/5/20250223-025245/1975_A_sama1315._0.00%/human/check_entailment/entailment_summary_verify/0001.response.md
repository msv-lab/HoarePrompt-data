### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and function summaries against the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we split the array into a prefix and suffix and swap them.
- The function `func_1(arr)` should correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation.

#### Analysis of `func_1(arr)`:
- The function `func_1(arr)` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`. If true, it returns "Yes".
- If the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next element using the condition `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`. If true, it returns "No".
- However, the `else` clause `else 'Yes'` is problematic. It assumes that if the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order, it must be sorted in non-increasing order, which is incorrect. The array could still be unsortable even if it is not sorted in non-increasing order.
- The function does not handle the scenario where the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix can be moved to the front to sort the array. It only checks if the array is already sorted or not.

#### Analysis of `func_2()`:
- The function `func_2()` reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1(arr)`, and prints the results.
- The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_2()`, which reads multiple test cases and computes the result for each using `func_1(arr)`.

### Conclusion:
- The `func_1(arr)` function is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operations. It incorrectly checks for non-increasing order and does not handle the logic for splitting and swapping parts of the array.
- The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with `func_1(arr)` and concludes that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect based on the analysis provided.
