The code snippet provided updates the value of `result` by assigning it the return value of the function `func_1(arr)`. The other variables remain unchanged as their values are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

In natural language: The variable `result` is updated to hold the return value of `func_1(arr)`. All other variables retain their initial values.
