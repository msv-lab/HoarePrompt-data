The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `index` by 1. The other variables (`arr`, `data`, `t`, `n`, `results`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value twice; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.
