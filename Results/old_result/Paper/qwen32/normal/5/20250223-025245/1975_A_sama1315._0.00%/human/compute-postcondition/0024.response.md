The code snippet `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Given the initial state, `index` is initially `3 + 2n + 1`. After adding `n` to it, the new value of `index` becomes `3 + 2n + 1 + n`, which simplifies to `3 + 3n + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `arr` is still a list of integers derived from the slice `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 3n + 1]`.
- `data` is still a list of strings.
- `t` is still the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2.
- `n` is still the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`.
- `results` is still a list containing the `result` value twice.
- `result` is still the return value of `func_1(arr)`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from the slice `data[3 + 2n + 1:3 + 3n + 1]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 3n + 1`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value twice; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.
