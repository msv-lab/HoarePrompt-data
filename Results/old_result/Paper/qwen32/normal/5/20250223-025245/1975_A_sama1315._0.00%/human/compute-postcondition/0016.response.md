The code snippet provided updates the value of `arr` by reassigning it to a new list of integers derived from slicing `data` starting from `index` to `index + n`. The new `arr` will contain integers converted from the strings in the specified slice of `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[2:2 + n]`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is `3 + n`.
- `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `results` is a list containing the `result` value.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `arr` is reassigned to a new list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, which is `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` integers derived from the slice `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + n`; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `results` is a list containing the `result` value; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.
