Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the allowed operation. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or not, but it does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping the array parts to achieve a sorted order.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part followed by the first part results in a non-decreasing array. This involves checking if there is a point where the array can be "rotated" to become sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        # Rotate the array by i positions and check if it is sorted
        rotated = arr[i:] + arr[:i]
        if all((rotated[j] <= rotated[j + 1] for j in range(n - 1))):
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'
```

This function checks all possible rotations of the array to see if any of them result in a sorted array. If any rotation results in a sorted array, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".
