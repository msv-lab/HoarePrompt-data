The code snippet provided increments `total_count` by the value of `cnt`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `res`) remain unchanged unless `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, in which case `res` is updated, but this condition is not part of the provided code snippet.

Given the initial state, the only change is in the value of `total_count`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair (e.g., `{1: 1}`), `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, and `res` remains unchanged.**
