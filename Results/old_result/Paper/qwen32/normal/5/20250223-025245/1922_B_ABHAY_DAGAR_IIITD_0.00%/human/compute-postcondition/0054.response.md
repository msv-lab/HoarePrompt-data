The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over `num_list`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `x` and how it relates to `num_list`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that tracks the count of each integer in `num_list`.

Since `x` is the loop variable that iterates over `num_list`, at the end of the previous iteration, `x` would have been the last element of `num_list` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be the next element in `num_list` if there are any remaining elements.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `x` should be the next element in `num_list` after the last processed element.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Let's denote the current value of `x` as `num_list[i]` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be `num_list[i+1]`.

Since we do not have the specific index `i` or the exact elements of `num_list`, we can only describe the state in terms of the next element in `num_list`.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the last processed element.**
