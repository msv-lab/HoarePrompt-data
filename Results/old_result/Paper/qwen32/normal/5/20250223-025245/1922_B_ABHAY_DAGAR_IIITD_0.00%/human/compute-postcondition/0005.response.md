To ensure that the for loop executes, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `num_list`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num_list` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`x`**: This is the loop variable that will take on the value of each element in `num_list` during each iteration. We don't need to adjust its state before the loop starts.
2. **`num_list`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `num_list` must contain at least one element.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.

We need to ensure that `num_list` has at least one element. Therefore, we adjust the state of `num_list` to have at least one integer.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary**.
