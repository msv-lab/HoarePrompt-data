The code snippet provided initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, or `num_list`. The only change is the introduction of `num_of_lens` as an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**
