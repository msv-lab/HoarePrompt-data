The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, we need to adjust `cnt` to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` for the loop to execute again.

Given that `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and `total_count` is updated as `total_count + cnt`, we need to consider the next value of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`.

Let's assume `num_of_lens` has at least two key-value pairs for the loop to execute one more time. For example, if `num_of_lens` is `{1: 1, 2: 3}`, and in the previous iteration `cnt` was `1`, then in the next iteration `cnt` should be `2`.

State: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs (e.g., `{1: 1, 2: 3}`), `total_count` is `total_count + cnt` (where `cnt` was 1 in the previous iteration, so now `total_count` is `total_count + 1`), and `res` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` (which is 2 if the previous value was 1)**

To generalize without specific values:
State: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt` (where `cnt` was the value from the previous iteration), and `res` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**
