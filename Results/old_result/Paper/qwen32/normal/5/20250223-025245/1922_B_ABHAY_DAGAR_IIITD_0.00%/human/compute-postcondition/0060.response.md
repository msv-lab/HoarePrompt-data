The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to 1. This means that if `x` was already a key in the dictionary, its value is now 1. If `x` was not a key in the dictionary, it is added with the value 1. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`) remain unchanged in terms of their values or conditions.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `num_of_lens[x]` is 1, `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the last processed element.**
