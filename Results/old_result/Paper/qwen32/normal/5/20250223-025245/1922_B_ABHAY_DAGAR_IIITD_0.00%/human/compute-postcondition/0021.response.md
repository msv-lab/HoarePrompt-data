The code snippet only initializes a new variable `total_count` to 0 and does not affect any of the existing variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `res`). Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `total_count` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0**.
