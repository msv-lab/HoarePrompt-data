The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the count of the element `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. Since `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the last processed element, the value associated with `x` in `num_of_lens` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the count of `x` incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in `num_list` after the last processed element.**
