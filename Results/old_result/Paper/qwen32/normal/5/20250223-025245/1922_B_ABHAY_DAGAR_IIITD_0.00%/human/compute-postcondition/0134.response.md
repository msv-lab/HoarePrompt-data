Let's analyze the given task step by step based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
- `results` is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `result`**: The code snippet is trying to print a variable named `result`. However, the initial state only mentions a list named `results`. There is no mention of a variable `result` in the initial state.
2. **Assumption**: Since the variable `result` is not defined in the initial state, it is likely a typo or a misunderstanding. The intention might have been to print `results` instead of `result`.

### Conclusion:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, there is no variable `result` defined. If the intention was to print the list `results`, the output would be the contents of the `results` list. However, based on the provided information, we cannot assume this without explicit confirmation.

Since the variable `result` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError`. However, if we assume the intention was to print `results`, the output would be the contents of the `results` list.

### Output (Assuming the intention was to print `results`):
Output: **results (where results is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements)**

### Final Output (Based on the given code snippet):
Since the variable `result` is not defined, the code will raise an error. However, following the instructions and assuming the intention was to print `results`:
Output: **results (where results is a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and must have at least 2 elements)**

If we strictly adhere to the given code snippet without any assumptions:
Output: **NameError: name 'result' is not defined**
