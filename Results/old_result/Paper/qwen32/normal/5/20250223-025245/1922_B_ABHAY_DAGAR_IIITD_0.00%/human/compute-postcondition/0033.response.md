Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the updated total count based on the previous `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged. `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `test_cases` remains an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` remains an empty list, `n` remains the input integer, `num_list` remains the list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` remains the updated total count based on the previous `cnt`. The value of `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. The value of `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` has already been updated by `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` in a previous step. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged from that previous step.
