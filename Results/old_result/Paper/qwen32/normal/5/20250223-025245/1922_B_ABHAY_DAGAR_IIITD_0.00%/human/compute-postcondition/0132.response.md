In the given initial state, `results` is described as a list containing the computed `res` for each test case in `test_cases` and must have at least one element. However, the print statement provided is `print(result)`, which refers to a variable named `result` (singular), not `results` (plural).

Since the variable `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can infer that there might be a typo in the print statement. If we assume that the intention was to print `results`, then the output would be the list `results`.

However, based on the given print statement, since `result` is not defined, the code would raise a `NameError`. But for the sake of adhering to the task and assuming the intention was to print `results`, we will proceed with that assumption.

Output: **results (where results is a list containing the computed res for each test case in test_cases)**
