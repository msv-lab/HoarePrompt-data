To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior and the effects of the loop on the variables involved.

The loop iterates over each element `x` in `num_list` and updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` to keep track of the count of each integer in `num_list`.

Here's the breakdown of the loop:
- `test_cases` is decremented by 1 with each iteration, but it doesn't affect the loop's execution directly. It just indicates that the loop is part of a larger context where multiple test cases are processed.
- `n` is an input integer and does not change during the loop.
- `num_list` is a list of integers that is fully processed by the loop.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that maps each integer in `num_list` to the number of times it appears in `num_list`.

After all iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain the frequency of each integer in `num_list`.

**Output State:**
- `test_cases` will be 0 if the loop was executed `test_cases` times initially.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
- `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it.
- `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list`.

In natural language, after the loop has processed all elements in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` will contain the frequency count of each integer in `num_list`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, and `num_list`) will remain in their initial states except `test_cases` which will be decremented to 0 if all iterations were executed.

Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the frequency count of each integer in `num_list`.**
