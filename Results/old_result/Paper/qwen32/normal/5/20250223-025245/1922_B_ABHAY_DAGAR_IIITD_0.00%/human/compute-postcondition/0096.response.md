Postcondition: **`test_cases` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers converted from the input and must have at least 1 element. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key. If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1. `res` is the sum of contributions from all `cnt` values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to the conditions, `total_count` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens` or set to 1 if `x` was not in `num_of_lens`, and `results` contains `res` as its last element.**
