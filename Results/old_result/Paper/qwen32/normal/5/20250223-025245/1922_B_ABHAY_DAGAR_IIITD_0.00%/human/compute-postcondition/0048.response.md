To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for x in num_list:`. This means we need to ensure that `num_list` is in a state that allows the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Head Analysis**: The loop iterates over `num_list`. For the loop to execute, `num_list` must contain at least one element.

2. **Current State**: According to the provided state, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input. However, there is no explicit mention of the size or content of `num_list`.

3. **Adjustment Requirement**: To ensure the loop executes, `num_list` must have at least one integer. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, and `num_of_lens`) do not directly affect the execution of this specific loop, as they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Final State**: We need to adjust `num_list` to ensure it contains at least one integer. The other variables can remain as they are, since they do not influence the loop's execution directly.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and specifically one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary**.
