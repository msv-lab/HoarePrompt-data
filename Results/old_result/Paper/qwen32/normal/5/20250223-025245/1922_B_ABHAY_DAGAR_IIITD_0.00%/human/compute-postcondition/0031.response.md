The code snippet modifies the variable `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given that `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, the updated value of `res` will be the previous value of `res` plus the calculated expression. The other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is the updated total count based on the previous `cnt`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
