To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **`cnt`**: This variable is used to iterate over the values of `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one value.
2. **`num_of_lens`**: This dictionary should contain at least one key-value pair to ensure that the loop has something to iterate over.

Given the initial state, `num_of_lens` is described as a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and each value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list`. To ensure the loop executes, `num_of_lens` must have at least one entry.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` will be 0, `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, `num_list` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair (e.g., `{1: 1}`), `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute because `num_of_lens` has at least one value to iterate over.
