The provided code snippet initializes a variable `good_subarrays` to 0. The initial state includes the lists `a` and `b`, and the integer `k`, but these are not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `good_subarrays`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m, and each element in `a` and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `good_subarrays` is 0.**
