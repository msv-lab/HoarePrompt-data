The code snippet creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer at `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and then appending the integer at `arr[i]` to this list. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the creation of `nums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is a boolean value, `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`.**
