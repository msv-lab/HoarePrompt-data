To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables involved.

The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1`. During each iteration, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. If true, it constructs a list `nums` by taking the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and appending `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, the variable `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first element of `nums`.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that the loop continues to execute until it either breaks due to `nums` not being sorted or completes all iterations.

### Final Output State Analysis:
1. **Variable `t`**: Remains unchanged.
2. **Variable `n`**: Remains unchanged.
3. **Variable `a`**: Remains unchanged.
4. **Variable `m`**: Remains unchanged.
5. **Variable `arr`**: Potentially modified based on the conditions inside the loop.
6. **Variable `ans`**: Can be `False` if `nums` was not sorted at any point, otherwise remains `True`.

The loop will execute `m - 1` iterations, and at the end of these iterations, the values of `arr` and `ans` will be the final states. The loop counter `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is determined by the state of `arr` and `ans` after the loop has completed all iterations. If `ans` is `False`, it means that at some point during the loop, the condition `nums != sorted(nums)` was met, causing the loop to break. If `ans` remains `True`, it means that `arr` was processed without any unsorted `nums` being encountered.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a potentially modified list of integers where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99, with modifications based on the loop's logic; `ans` is a boolean that is `False` if any `nums` was not sorted during the loop, otherwise `True`.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is that `arr` may have been modified based on the loop's logic, and `ans` indicates whether the loop completed without finding any unsorted `nums`.
