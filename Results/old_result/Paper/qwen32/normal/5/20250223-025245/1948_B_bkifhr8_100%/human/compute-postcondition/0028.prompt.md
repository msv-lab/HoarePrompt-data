Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `ans` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`; `nums` is a list created by converting the digits of `arr[i - 1]` into a list and appending `arr[i]` to it; `ans` is a boolean that remains True if `nums` is sorted, otherwise it is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr[i - 1]` or `nums`, and `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `i` is decreased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, no changes are made to `arr`, `nums`, or `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input line where each integer satisfies 0 <= integer <= 99; `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i-1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
