Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `i` is `i - 1`; `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`, specifically `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]; `ans` is False; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
