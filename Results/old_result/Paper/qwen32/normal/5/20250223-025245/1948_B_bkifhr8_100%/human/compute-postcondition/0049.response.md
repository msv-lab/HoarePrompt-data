Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers where if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[0]` is updated to `nums[0]` and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, with `nums` being a list consisting of the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged; `i` is 1.**
