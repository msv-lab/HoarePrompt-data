Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is the new input integer; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is `True`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and `ans` is set to False if `nums` (which consists of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`) is not sorted. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i - 1`, and `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[i - 1]` updated to `nums[0]`; `i` is `i - 1`; `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and the last element is `arr[i]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
