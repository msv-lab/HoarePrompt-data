The code snippet provided updates the `nums` list based on the value of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]`. Specifically, it converts `arr[i - 1]` into its individual digits and then appends `arr[i]` to this list of digits.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.
- `m` is at least 2.
- `arr` is a list of integers with specific conditions for its elements.
- `i` is 2.

The code snippet:
```python
nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
```
This line of code converts `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and appends `arr[i]` to this list.

Therefore, the new value of `nums` will be a list consisting of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers; `i` is 2; `nums` is a list of integers where the first elements are the digits of `arr[1]` and the last element is `arr[2]`.**
