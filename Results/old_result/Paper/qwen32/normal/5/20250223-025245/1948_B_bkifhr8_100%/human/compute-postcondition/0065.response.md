The code snippet converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and then appends `arr[i]` to this list, creating a new list `nums`.

Given that `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the specific values of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` are not provided, but we know their relationship. Let's denote `arr[i - 1]` as `x` and `arr[i]` as `y` where `x > y`.

After the code execution, `nums` will be a list of the digits of `x` followed by `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `m` is the new input integer and must be at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input; `ans` is `True`. At the current index `i`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`; `nums` is a list of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
