Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The logic and formula used in `func_2` do not align with the problem requirements.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and check if the condition is met. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate gcd
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

# Function to count valid pairs
def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program reads the input, processes each test case, and counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. It then prints the results for each test case.
