The value of `x` is recalculated using the formula `n - (i * i - i)`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, while `x` is updated to this new value. The other variables (`m`, `cnt`, `y`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, `m` is greater than 1, `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`, `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`, `y` is `i * i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
