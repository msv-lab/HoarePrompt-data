### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summaries provided.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`
This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

#### Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`
This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`. However, the implementation does not match the problem requirements.

Let's break down the logic in `func_2` and see if it matches the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
2. **Loop through `b` values**: The loop runs from `1` to `m-1` (not including `m`).
3. **Calculate `x` and `y`**:
   - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
   - `y = i * i`
4. **Update counter**:
   - `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`
5. **Return result**:
   - If `cnt` is zero, return `1`.
   - Otherwise, return `cnt`.

### Issues with `func_2`:
1. **Range of `b`**: The loop runs from `1` to `m-1`, but the problem specifies \(1 \leq b \leq m\), so `m` should be included.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the loop. Instead, the function uses a derived formula which is not explained and does not seem to correspond to the problem's condition.
3. **Special Case Handling**: The function returns `1` if `cnt` is zero, which is not a correct handling of the problem's logic.

### Correct Implementation Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
