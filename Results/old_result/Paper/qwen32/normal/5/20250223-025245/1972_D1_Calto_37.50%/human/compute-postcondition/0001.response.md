The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those for the loop to execute. According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 1 because the `range(1, m)` function will generate numbers from 1 up to, but not including, `m`. If `m` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

Given that `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 2. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. The variable `n` and `cnt` do not affect the loop execution and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` must be greater than 1, `cnt` is 0**
