### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) as specified in the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning and verify it step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The pairs \((a, b)\) must satisfy \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
   - The condition \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Provided Code**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function is intended to count the valid pairs but does not implement the logic correctly.

3. **Issues in `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - **Loop Range**: The loop runs from \(1\) to \(m-1\) instead of \(1\) to \(m\), missing the case where \(b = m\).
   - **Logic Inside the Loop**: The logic (`x = n - (i * i - i)`, `y = i * i`, `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`) does not correctly implement the logic to count valid pairs \((a, b)\).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves iterating through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers.
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The annotations state that `cnt` is calculated as `n + (m - 2) + sum((n - (k^2 - k)) // (k^2) for k in range(2, m))`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement.
  - The formula used in the loop does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
