### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the given program code, using the annotated version to systematically check the behavior and reasoning.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **Annotation**: The state of `a` after the function call is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.
   - **Annotation**: The state of `cnt` after the loop is calculated as `n + (m - 2) + sum((n - (k^2 - k)) // (k^2) for k in range(2, m))`. The function returns `1` if `cnt` is zero, otherwise it returns `cnt`.

#### Issues with `func_2`:

- **Range of `b`**: The loop runs from `1` to `m-1`, but the problem specifies \(1 \leq b \leq m\). This means `m` should be included in the loop.
- **Condition Check**: The provided logic in `func_2` does not directly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a derived formula that is not explained and does not seem to correspond to the problem's condition.
- **Special Case Handling**: The function returns `1` if `cnt` is zero, which is not a correct handling of the problem's logic.

#### Detailed Check Using Annotations:

- **Initialization**: `cnt` is initialized to 0.
- **Loop through `b` values**: The loop runs from `1` to `m-1`.
- **Calculate `x` and `y`**:
  - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
  - `y = i * i`
- **Update counter**:
  - `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`
- **Return result**:
  - If `cnt` is zero, return 1.
  - Otherwise, return `cnt`.

The annotations suggest that the loop is calculating a specific sum, but this sum does not directly relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
