### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem, the provided program, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Condition**: \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. **Condition**: \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

#### Function Summary:
The function summary for `func_2(n, m)` states that it calculates a value `cnt` using a specific formula and returns 1 if `cnt` equals 0; otherwise, it returns `cnt`. However, the summary does not provide enough detail to confirm the correctness of the formula or the logic used.

#### Issues in `func_2(n, m)`:
1. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from \(1\) to \(m-1\), missing the case when \(b = m\).
2. **Logic**: The logic inside the loop (`x = n - (i * i - i)`, `y = i * i`, `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`) does not correctly implement the logic to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

#### Evaluation:
The provided `func_2(n, m)` does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. The original assessment is correct in identifying these issues.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

Final: **False**
