The code snippet appends an integer value from `list1` to `list2`. Specifically, it appends the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` to `list2`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this line, the value of `i` used here is the incremented value.

Given the initial state, `list2` already contains the integer value of `list1[2 * (i - 1)]`. After executing the line `list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))`, `list2` will now include the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `a` is an integer such that `a` ≥ 1, `num` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer values of `list1[2 * (i - 1)]` and `list1[2 * i]`, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
