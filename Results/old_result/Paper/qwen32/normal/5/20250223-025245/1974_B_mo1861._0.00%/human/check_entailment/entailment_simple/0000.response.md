### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to decode an encoded string `b` back to its original form `s` using the described encoding algorithm. The decoding process involves the following steps:

1. **Construct the auxiliary string `r`:** This string consists of all distinct characters of `b` sorted in alphabetical order.
2. **Map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`:** The first character in `r` is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.

The provided program follows these steps in the `func_1` function:
1. It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted set of `b`.
2. It then constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value from `char_map`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the provided program. The mapping in `char_map` is incorrect. The program maps each character in `b` to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing in reverse order based on the position of the character in the sorted set of `b`, which is not what the problem requires. Instead, it should map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of `b`.

Here's the corrected logic for `char_map`:
- The sorted set of characters in `b` should be mapped to their symmetric characters in the same set.

Let's correct the `char_map` creation:
- First, sort the unique characters in `b`.
- Then, map each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    return s
```

### Correctness:
The provided program, as given, is incorrect due to the incorrect mapping logic in `char_map`.

Correctness: **False**
