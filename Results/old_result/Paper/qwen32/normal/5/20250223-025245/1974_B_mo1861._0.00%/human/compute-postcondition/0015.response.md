The code snippet `s += char_map[c]` appends the value of `char_map[c]` to the string `s`. Given that `c` is the next character in `b`, the value of `s` will be updated to include the value mapped to `c` in the `char_map` dictionary.

Output State: **`c` is the next character in `b`; `s` is updated to `s + char_map[c]`.**
