The loop head in the provided for loop includes the variables `i`, `c`, `b`, and the result of `sorted(set(b))`. According to the loop, it will iterate over the unique characters in the string `b` after sorting them. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `b` contains at least one character, as an empty string would result in an empty set and, consequently, no iterations.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`b`**: The string `b` must contain at least one character to ensure that `sorted(set(b))` is not empty.
2. **`sorted(set(b))`**: This part of the loop head depends on `b`. Since `set(b)` will be empty if `b` is empty, and `sorted()` on an empty set will also be empty, we need to ensure `b` has at least one character.
3. **`i`**: This is the index variable which will be automatically assigned by `enumerate()`. We don't need to adjust this before the loop starts, as it will be set during the first iteration.
4. **`c`**: This is the character variable which will be automatically assigned by `enumerate()`. Similar to `i`, we don't need to adjust this before the loop starts, as it will be set during the first iteration.

Given this, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `b` has at least one character. The variables `s` and `char_map` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and must have at least one character, `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`, `char_map` is an empty dictionary**.
