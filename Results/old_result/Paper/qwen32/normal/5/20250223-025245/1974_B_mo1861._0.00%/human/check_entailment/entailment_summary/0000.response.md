Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to decode a string based on the description given in the problem. However, there is a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the encoding process in the implementation. The problem states that the encoding process involves creating a string `r` of distinct characters from the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`. 

The decoding process should therefore involve reversing this process: creating the string `r` from the distinct characters in the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r`. However, the implementation incorrectly maps each character in `b` to a character starting from 'a' in reverse order based on the length of `b`, which is not aligned with the described encoding process.

To correctly decode the string, we should:
1. Construct the string `r` from the distinct characters in `b` in alphabetical order.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Step 1: Create the string r from the distinct characters in b in alphabetical order.
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric character in r.
    char_map = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Step 3: Use this mapping to decode the string b.
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

Given the original implementation, the reasoning shows that the program is incorrect because it does not follow the described encoding and decoding process.

Correctness: **False**
