Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a unique character starting from 'a' and incrementing in reverse order based on the position of the character in the sorted set of `b`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `char_map` will have an entry for each unique character in the string `b`. The characters in `char_map` will be mapped to letters starting from 'a' and going up to 'z' in reverse order based on their sorted position in `b`. The variables `b` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
