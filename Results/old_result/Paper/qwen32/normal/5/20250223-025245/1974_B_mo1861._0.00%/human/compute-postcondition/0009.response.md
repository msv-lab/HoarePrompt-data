The provided code snippet sets the variable `s` to an empty string. Therefore, `s` is no longer the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`, but instead, it is an empty string. The values of `b` and `char_map` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `s` is an empty string; `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a unique character starting from 'a' and incrementing in reverse order based on the position of the character in the sorted set of `b`.**
