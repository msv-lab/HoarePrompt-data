The code assigns a value to `char_map[c]` based on the length of the string `b` and the index `i`. Specifically, `char_map[c]` is set to a character derived from the ASCII value of 'a' plus the difference between the length of `b` and `i + 1`.

Given the initial state, `char_map` is an empty dictionary. After the execution of the code, `char_map` will have a new key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is calculated as described.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and must have at least one character; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is a dictionary with one additional entry where `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.**
