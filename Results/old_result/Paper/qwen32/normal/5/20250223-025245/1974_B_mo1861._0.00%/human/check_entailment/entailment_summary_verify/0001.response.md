### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to decode an encoded string `b` to get the original string `s`.
- The encoding process involves creating a string `r` of distinct characters from `s` in alphabetical order.
- Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a set from the string `b` to get the distinct characters and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. The symmetric character is determined by the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted set of `b`.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` is incorrect. This formula is trying to map the characters to a new sequence starting from 'a', which is not the intended behavior.
- The symmetric character should be the character at the position `len(r) - i - 1` in the sorted set `r`, not calculated based on the entire length of `b`.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct way to find the symmetric character for each character in `r` is to map the character at index `i` in the sorted set `r` to the character at index `len(r) - i - 1` in the sorted set `r`.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    r = sorted(set(b))
    for (i, c) in enumerate(r):
        char_map[c] = r[len(r) - i - 1]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies the issue in the code. The formula used to calculate the symmetric character is incorrect, and the correct approach is to map each character in `r` to its symmetric character within `r`.

#### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the symmetric character.

**Final: False**
