Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i, c in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and must have at least one character; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is a dictionary with one additional entry where `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and has at least one character; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is updated with `char_map[c]` being `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`; `i` is incremented by 1; `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and has at least one character; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is updated with `char_map[c]` being `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b` after its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
