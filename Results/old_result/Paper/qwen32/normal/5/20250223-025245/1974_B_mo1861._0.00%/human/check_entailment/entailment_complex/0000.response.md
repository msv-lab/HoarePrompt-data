### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to decode a string based on the encoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the code and its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and then the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`.
   - It first creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted set of characters in `b`.
     - The mapping is done by sorting the unique characters in `b` and then mapping the first character to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
   - It then constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped character from `char_map`.

3. **Correctness of the Mapping:**
   - The mapping in `char_map` is incorrect. The problem states that each character in the original string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r` (which is the sorted set of unique characters in `s`). However, the code incorrectly maps the characters in `b` to characters starting from 'a' in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.
   - The correct approach would be to map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in the sorted set of unique characters in `b` directly, not to characters starting from 'a'.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input string `b = "serofedsoc"`, the unique characters in sorted order are `r = "cdefors"`.
   - The correct mapping should be: `c -> s`, `d -> r`, `e -> o`, `f -> e`, `o -> d`, `r -> c`, `s -> f`.
   - Using the provided code, the mapping would be incorrect because it doesn't map to the symmetric character in `r` but rather to characters starting from 'a' in reverse order.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly decode the string `b` according to the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
