Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a set from the string `b` to get the distinct characters and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `r`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. The symmetric character is determined by the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted set of `b`. However, this formula is incorrect. The symmetric character should be the character at the position `len(r) - i - 1` in the sorted set `r`, not calculated based on the entire length of `b`.
   - The function then constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Symmetric Character Calculation:**
  - The formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` is incorrect. It tries to map the characters to a new sequence starting from 'a', which is not the intended behavior. Instead, the symmetric character should be the character at the position `len(r) - i - 1` in the sorted set `r`.

### Correct Approach:

- **Correct Symmetric Character Calculation:**
  - The correct way to find the symmetric character for each character in `r` is to map the character at index `i` in the sorted set `r` to the character at index `len(r) - i - 1` in the sorted set `r`.

### Corrected Code:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    r = sorted(set(b))
    for (i, c) in enumerate(r):
        char_map[c] = r[len(r) - i - 1]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

### Final Answer:

The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the symmetric character.

Correctness: **False**
