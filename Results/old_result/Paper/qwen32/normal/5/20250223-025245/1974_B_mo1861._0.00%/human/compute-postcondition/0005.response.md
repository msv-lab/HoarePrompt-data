The provided Python code snippet updates the `char_map` dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is the next character `c` from the sorted set of the string `b`, and the value is calculated based on the length of `b` and the incremented `i`. 

Given the initial state:
- `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and has at least one character.
- `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`.
- `char_map` is a dictionary with an additional entry where `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b`.

The code snippet modifies `char_map` by adding or updating the entry for `c`. The value assigned to `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and has at least one character; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is updated with `char_map[c]` being `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`; `i` is incremented by 1; `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `b` remains the same string of lowercase Latin letters; `s` remains the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is updated to include or modify the entry for `c` with a new value based on the length of `b` and the incremented `i`; `i` is now one greater than its previous value; `c` is the next character in the sorted set of `b`.
