You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function `func_1` will be called multiple times (up to 10^4 times) with different strings b, each of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and the total sum of all n values across all test cases will not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `s` is the decoded string returned by `func_1(b)`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a unique character starting from 'a' and incrementing in reverse order based on the position of the character in the sorted set of `b`.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: `s` is the transformed string of `b` using `char_map`, and `char_map` remains unchanged.
    return s
    #The program returns the transformed string `s` which is the result of transforming string `b` using `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `b`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a transformed string `s` which is the result of transforming string `b` using `char_map`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the transformed string `s` which is the result of transforming string `b` using `char_map`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
