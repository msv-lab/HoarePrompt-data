Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` > 0, then `nums[1]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, otherwise `nums[1]` remains 0, and the rest of the elements in `nums` are 0.**
