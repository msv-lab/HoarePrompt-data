Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest are 0, `k` is now `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`, and the current value of `k` is greater than 0.**
