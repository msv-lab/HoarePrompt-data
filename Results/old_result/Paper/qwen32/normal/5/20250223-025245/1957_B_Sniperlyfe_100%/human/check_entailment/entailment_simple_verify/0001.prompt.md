You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is the remaining value after subtracting the sum of `nums[i]` for i from 1 to n-1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the rest of the elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which they are 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first element is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k` and the subsequent elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which the remaining elements are 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The sum of the sequence \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) should be equal to \( k \).
2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence should be maximized.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
The program reads \( t \) test cases, each consisting of \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(n, k)` and prints the result.

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes a list `nums` of length \( n \) with all elements set to 0.
2. **First Element Setting**:
   - It sets the first element to \( (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 \).
   - This means it sets the first element to the largest number with the same number of bits as \( k \) but with all bits set to 1, except the most significant bit.
   - For example, if \( k = 5 \) (binary: 101), the first element will be set to 3 (binary: 11).
3. **Distributing Remaining Sum**:
   - It then distributes the remaining sum \( k \) among the remaining elements.
   - It sets each subsequent element to the minimum of \( nums[0] + 1 \) and the remaining \( k \).
   - It subtracts the value assigned to each element from \( k \).
4. **Adjusting the First Element**:
   - Finally, it adds the remaining \( k \) to the first element.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Maximizing the Number of 1s in Bitwise OR**:
  - The approach of setting the first element to \( (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 \) and then distributing the remaining sum does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
  - For example, if \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 5 \), the program sets the first element to 3 (binary: 11) and the second element to 2 (binary: 10), resulting in a bitwise OR of 11 (binary: 11) which has 2 1s.
  - However, the optimal solution is 1 (binary: 01) and 4 (binary: 100), resulting in a bitwise OR of 101 (binary: 101) which has 3 1s.
- **Suboptimal Distribution**:
  - The distribution strategy does not consider the optimal placement of 1s in the binary representation of the numbers to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

**Correctness: False**
