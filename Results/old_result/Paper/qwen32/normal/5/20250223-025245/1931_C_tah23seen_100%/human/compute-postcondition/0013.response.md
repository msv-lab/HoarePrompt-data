Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first `k` elements are all equal, `i` is `k`, `j` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 2, and `k` must be at least `n - 1`.**

In simple terms, the value of `j` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
