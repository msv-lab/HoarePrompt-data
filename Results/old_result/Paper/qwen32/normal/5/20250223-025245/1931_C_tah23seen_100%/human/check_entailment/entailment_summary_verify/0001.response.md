### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and its logic in the context of the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Recap:
We need to find the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by applying at most one operation. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a specific value, with the cost being the length of the subarray.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each test case. Here's the breakdown of the logic in `func_1`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `i` is set to 0, representing the start of the array.
   - `j` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, representing the end of the array.

2. **Finding the First Change:**
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` as long as the current element is the same as the next element. This effectively finds the first index where the sequence of identical elements ends.

3. **Finding the Last Change:**
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` as long as the current element is the same as the previous element. This finds the last index where the sequence of identical elements starts from the end.

4. **Checking if the Array is Already Uniform:**
   - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it means the array is already uniform or has the same start and end elements. In this case, the cost is the length of the middle segment that needs to be changed, which is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - If the array is not uniform, the cost is the minimum of changing the segment from the start to `j` or from `i` to the end, which is `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary provided states that `func_1` returns 0 regardless of the input, which is clearly inaccurate based on the logic in the code.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
The provided logic has significant issues:

- **Handling of Multiple Segments:**
  - The logic does not correctly handle arrays with multiple segments of different values. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the correct minimum cost is 4, as we need to change the middle segment `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to make the entire array uniform.
  - The current logic only considers the first and last segments and their transitions, which is insufficient for all cases.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle cases where the array has multiple segments of different values correctly. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the correct minimum cost is 4, but the program might not compute this correctly due to the way it calculates `i` and `j`.

- **Return Value:**
  - The function summary states that the function always returns 0, which is incorrect based on the provided code. The function can return values other than 0 depending on the input array.

### Conclusion:
Given the logic flaws and the fact that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
