Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal by applying at most one operation. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a specific value, with the cost being the length of the subarray.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each test case. Here's the breakdown of the logic in `func_1`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `i` is set to 0, representing the start of the array.
   - `j` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, representing the end of the array.

2. **Finding the First Change:**
   - The first `while` loop increments `i` as long as the current element is the same as the next element. This effectively finds the first index where the sequence of identical elements ends.

3. **Finding the Last Change:**
   - The second `while` loop decrements `j` as long as the current element is the same as the previous element. This finds the last index where the sequence of identical elements starts from the end.

4. **Checking if the Array is Already Uniform:**
   - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it means the array is already uniform or has the same start and end elements. In this case, the cost is the length of the middle segment that needs to be changed, which is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - If the array is not uniform, the cost is the minimum of changing the segment from the start to `j` or from `i` to the end, which is `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The provided program seems to be attempting to find the minimum cost based on the idea of changing the least number of elements to make the array uniform. However, there are some issues with the logic:

- **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle cases where the array has multiple segments of different values correctly. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the correct minimum cost is 4, but the program might not compute this correctly due to the way it calculates `i` and `j`.

- **Logic Flaws:** The logic for calculating `i` and `j` does not account for the possibility of multiple segments of different values that might need to be changed. The program only considers the first and last segments and their transitions, which is insufficient for all cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the logic flaws and the fact that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
