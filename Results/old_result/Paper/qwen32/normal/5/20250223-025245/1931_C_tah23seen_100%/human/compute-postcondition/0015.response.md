The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `j` was initially `n - 2`, after decrementing it becomes `n - 3`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first `k` elements are all equal, `i` is `k`, `j` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 2, and `k` must be at least `n - 1`.**
