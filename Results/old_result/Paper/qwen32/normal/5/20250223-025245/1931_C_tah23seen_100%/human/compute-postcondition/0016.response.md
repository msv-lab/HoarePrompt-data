To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided information and the behavior of the loop.

The loop:
```python
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
    j -= 1
```
This loop decrements `j` as long as `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]` and `j` is greater than 0. This means that `j` will stop decrementing when it reaches a point where `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]` or when `j` becomes 0.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `j` is `n - 2`
- After 2 iterations: `j` is `n - 3`
- After 3 iterations: `j` is `n - 3`

This suggests that the loop continues to decrement `j` until it reaches a point where `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]`. If `k` (the number of equal elements at the start) is equal to `n` (the length of the list), then the loop will decrement `j` until `j` is 0.

Therefore, after all iterations, `j` will be 0 if all elements in the list are equal. If not all elements are equal, `j` will be the index of the first element from the end that is not equal to the previous one.

Since the problem states that the first `k` elements are all equal and `k` can be as large as `n`, the final state will be when `j` is 0 if the entire list is uniform. Otherwise, `j` will stop at the first non-matching element from the end.

However, given the precondition and the pattern in the provided output states, we can infer that the loop will run until `j` is 0 if `k` is `n`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first `k` elements are all equal, `i` is `k`, `j` is `0`, and `n` is the length of the list `arr`.**

In natural language: The final output state is that `j` will be 0, indicating that the loop has decremented `j` as far as possible, and all elements in the list are equal up to the `k`th element.
