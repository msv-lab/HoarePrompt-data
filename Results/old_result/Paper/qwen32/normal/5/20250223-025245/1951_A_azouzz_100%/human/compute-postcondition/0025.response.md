The code snippet `cnt1 = s.count('1')` updates the variable `cnt1` to the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and the previous value of `cnt1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.**
