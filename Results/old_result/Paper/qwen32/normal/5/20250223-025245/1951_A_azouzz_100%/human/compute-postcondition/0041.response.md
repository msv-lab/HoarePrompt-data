The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state and the conditions described do not affect the value printed by this statement. The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` are mentioned in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement because the statement is a simple print of the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
