Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `s` contains the substring '11', then `cnt1` is an even number greater than 2. Otherwise, `cnt1` is either 0, 2, or an odd number greater than 2.**
