Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` also remain unchanged.**
