The code snippet provided is `parent_v = dsu.find(v)`. This line updates the value of `parent_v` to the result of the `dsu.find(v)` operation. Since the union operation has already been performed on `u` and `v`, the value of `parent_v` may change to reflect the new parent of `v` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure.

Given that the union operation has been performed, `parent_v` will now be equal to `parent_u` if `u` and `v` were in different sets before the union. If they were already in the same set, `parent_v` would remain unchanged.

However, since the union operation was performed, we can assume that `u` and `v` were in different sets initially, and thus `parent_v` is now equal to `parent_u`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next_next, u_next_next, v_next_next)`; `u` is `u_next_next`; `v` is `v_next_next`; `w` is `w_next_next`; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` after the union operation; `parent_v` is `parent_u`; `_min_edge` is `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `node_u` is set to `u` and `node_v` is set to `v`.**
