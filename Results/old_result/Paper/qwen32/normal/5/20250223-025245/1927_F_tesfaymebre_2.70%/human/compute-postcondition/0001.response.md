In the given task, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the state of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. The value of `test_cases` is determined by the function `func_1()`, and we know that `1 <= test_cases <= 10^4`.

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times, we do not need to adjust its state before the loop starts. The only variable that needs to be ensured is `test_cases`.

Given that `test_cases` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10,000 by the problem statement, we do not need to adjust it further. However, for the sake of clarity in the state, we can specify that `test_cases` must be within the given range.

State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` and must be between 1 and 10^4**
