Postcondition: ***`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`. The color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. `graph[curr]` must contain at least one neighbor. If `nei` (a neighbor of `curr`) has a color that is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then `res` is the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`, and the condition `res and node_v in set_res` is false, meaning either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res` or `set_res`.***
