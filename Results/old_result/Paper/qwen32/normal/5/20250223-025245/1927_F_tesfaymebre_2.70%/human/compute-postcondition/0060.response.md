The provided code snippet initializes a list `colors` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and contains all the edges added during the loop; `edges` is a list containing all the tuples `(w, u, v)` added during the loop, sorted in descending order by `w`; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes; `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop; `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements and reflects all the unions performed during the loop; `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight in the final connected component; `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of the edge with `_min_edge` weight in the final connected component; `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to `0`.**
