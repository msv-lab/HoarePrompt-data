The code snippet converts the result `res` from the `dfs` function call into a set and assigns it to the variable `set_res`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`, the color of the current vertex `curr` is 1, `graph[curr]` must contain at least one more neighbor, `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]`, and `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`.**
