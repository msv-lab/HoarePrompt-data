Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`; `u` is `u_next`; `v` is `v_next`; `w` is `w_next`; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)`; `parent_v` is the result of `dsu.find(v)`; the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` has been performed in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure with weight `w`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The union operation between the sets containing `u` and `v` has been performed in the DSU structure, potentially changing the parent pointers and sizes of the sets involved. All other variables retain their initial values.
