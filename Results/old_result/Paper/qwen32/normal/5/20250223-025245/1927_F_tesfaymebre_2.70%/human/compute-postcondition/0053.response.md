The code snippet assigns the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` to `_min_edge`. This assignment does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, `node_u`, or `node_v`. It only updates the value of `_min_edge` to reflect the current minimum edge weight associated with `parent_u` in the disjoint set union structure `dsu`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next_next, u_next_next, v_next_next)`; `u` is `u_next_next`; `v` is `v_next_next`; `w` is `w_next_next`; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` after the union operation; `parent_v` is `parent_u`; `_min_edge` is `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`.**
