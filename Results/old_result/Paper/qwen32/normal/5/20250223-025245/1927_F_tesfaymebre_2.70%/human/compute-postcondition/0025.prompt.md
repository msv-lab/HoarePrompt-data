Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, and `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`. The color of the current vertex `curr` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`. The color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. `graph[curr]` must contain at least one neighbor. If `nei` (a neighbor of `curr`) has a color that is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then `res` is the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`, and the condition `res and node_v in set_res` is false, meaning either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `res` or `set_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`, and the color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. `graph[curr]` must contain at least one more neighbor, `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, and if `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `res`, the program returns `res`. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`, and the color of the current vertex `curr` is 1. `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]` after the previously processed neighbor. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is the result of `dfs(nei, curr, path)`. `set_res` is a set containing unique elements from `res`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything. If `colors[nei]` is 2 or `nei` is equal to `parent`, the function does not perform any additional actions and does not return anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
