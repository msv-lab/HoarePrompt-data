Functionality: **The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr` (an integer representing the current vertex), `parent` (an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex), and `path` (a list of integers representing the current path in the Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal). The function performs a DFS and returns the current path if no cycle is detected. If a cycle is detected, it returns the path containing the cycle. If no cycle is found and all neighbors are processed, it returns an empty list.**
