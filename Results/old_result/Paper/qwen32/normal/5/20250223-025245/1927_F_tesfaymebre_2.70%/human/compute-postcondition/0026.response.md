Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal including `curr`. The color of the current vertex `curr` is 2. No result containing `node_v` was found in any of the recursive calls, so the function does not return anything.**

In simpler terms, the color of the current vertex `curr` has been changed to 2. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
