Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and contains all the edges added during the loop; `edges` is a list containing all the tuples `(w, u, v)` added during the loop, sorted in descending order by `w`; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes, indicating all iterations have finished; `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop; `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements; `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`; `node_u` is `-1`; `node_v` is `-1`.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\). `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w, u, v)`. `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes. `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop. `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements and reflects the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`. If `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v` before the union, and `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` and `node_u` is set to `u` and `node_v` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains `float('inf')` and `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`. If `parent_u` was not equal to `parent_v` before the union, then `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` will return the same value after the union, and `_min_edge` remains `float('inf')` and `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`; `u` is `u_next`; `v` is `v_next`; `w` is `w_next`; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` before the union operation; `parent_v` is the result of `dsu.find(v)` before the union operation; the union operation has been performed on `u` and `v` with weight `w` in the `dsu` structure. If `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v`, the union operation was not performed, and the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `_min_edge` is `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `node_u` is set to `u` and `node_v` is set to `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next_next, u_next_next, v_next_next)`; `u` is `u_next_next`; `v` is `v_next_next`; `w` is `w_next_next`; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)` after the union operation; `parent_v` is `parent_u`; `_min_edge` is the minimum of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` and `w`. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `w`. If `_min_edge` is updated to `w`, then `node_u` is set to `u` and `node_v` is set to `v`. If `_min_edge` is not updated, `node_u` and `node_v` retain their previous values. If `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`, the union operation is performed, potentially updating the parent and minimum edge information in the DSU structure, and `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge` before the union.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
