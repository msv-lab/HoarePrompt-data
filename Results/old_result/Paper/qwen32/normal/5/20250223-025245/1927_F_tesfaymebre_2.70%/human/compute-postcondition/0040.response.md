Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`; `u` is `u_next`; `v` is `v_next`; `w` is `w_next`; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)`**.

In simple terms, the value of `parent_u` has been updated to be the result of the `dsu.find(u)` operation. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `u`, `v`, `w`) remain unchanged.
