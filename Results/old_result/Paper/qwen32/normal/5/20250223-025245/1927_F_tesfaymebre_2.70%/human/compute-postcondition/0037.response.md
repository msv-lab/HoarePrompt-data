The code snippet `dsu.union(u, v, w)` will merge the sets containing `u` and `v` in the disjoint set union (DSU) data structure, and it might update the minimum edge weight if `w` is smaller than the current `_min_edge`. However, in this specific context, the task does not specify any change to `_min_edge` or `node_u` and `node_v` based on the union operation, so these variables remain unchanged. The only change is in the internal state of the `dsu` object, which now reflects the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory; `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w, u, v)`; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes; `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop; `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements and now reflects the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`; `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`; `node_u` is `-1`; `node_v` is `-1`; `parent_u` is the result of `dsu.find(u)`; `parent_v` is the result of `dsu.find(v)`; `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v` before the union, but after the union, `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` will return the same value.**
