To determine the Output State, we need to consider the impact of `func_6()` on the existing variables. However, the function `func_6()` is not defined in the provided context, so we cannot determine its specific impact on the variables. Therefore, we will assume that `func_6()` does not affect `test_cases` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` minus 1, and must be between 0 and 10^4 - 1.

Since the code snippet only calls `func_6()` and there is no information provided about how `func_6()` modifies `test_cases`, we will assume that `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()` minus 1, and must be between 0 and 10^4 - 1.**
