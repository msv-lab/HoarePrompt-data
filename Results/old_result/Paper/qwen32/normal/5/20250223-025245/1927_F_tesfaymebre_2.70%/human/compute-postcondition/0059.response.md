Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\); `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory and contains all the edges added during the loop; `edges` is a list containing all the tuples `(w, u, v)` added during the loop, sorted in descending order by `w`; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes; `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop; `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements and reflects all the unions performed during the loop; `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight in the final connected component; `node_u` and `node_v` are the nodes of the edge with `_min_edge` weight in the final connected component.** The loop processes all `m` edges, performing union operations and updating the DSU structure to reflect the connected components. The `_min_edge` and corresponding nodes `node_u` and `node_v` are updated to reflect the minimum edge weight in the final connected component formed by the union-find operations.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the DSU structure will fully represent the connected components formed by the edges. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `edges` still contains all the edges sorted by weight. The variables `u`, `v`, and `w` will hold the values from the last edge processed. The `_min_edge` will be the smallest edge weight in the final connected component, and `node_u` and `node_v` will be the nodes of that edge.
