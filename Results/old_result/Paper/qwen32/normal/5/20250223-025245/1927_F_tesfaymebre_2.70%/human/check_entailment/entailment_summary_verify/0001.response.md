### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary provided.

#### Problem Breakdown

The problem requires finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph such that the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The program should output the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the cycle itself as a sequence of vertices.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to read input efficiently.
   - `func_6` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, and then reads the edges into a dictionary `graph` and a list `edges`.

2. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This is not necessary for finding the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge, but it doesn't affect the correctness of the algorithm if the logic is otherwise correct.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU data structure is used to detect cycles in the graph. The DSU is initialized with `n + 1` elements (to account for 1-based indexing).
   - As edges are processed, the DSU is used to check if adding an edge would form a cycle. If it does, the program records the minimum weight edge in the cycle.

4. **Finding the Cycle:**
   - Once a cycle is detected, the program performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the vertices in the cycle (`node_u`). The DFS is used to reconstruct the cycle.
   - The DFS function `dfs` traverses the graph, marking nodes as visited, and returns the cycle once it encounters a node that has already been visited.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the cycle itself.

#### Issues in the Program

1. **DFS Function:**
   - The DFS function `dfs` uses a global variable `graph` which is not defined within the function. This is a major issue because the `graph` variable is local to `func_6`. This will result in a `NameError` when the DFS function tries to access `graph`.
   - The DFS function also uses a global variable `node_v` which is not defined within the function. This is another issue that will cause a `NameError`.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program correctly detects a cycle using the DSU and records the minimum weight edge in the cycle. However, the way the cycle is reconstructed using DFS is problematic. The DFS function does not correctly handle the reconstruction of the cycle because it relies on global variables that are not properly defined.

3. **Edge Sorting:**
   - Sorting edges in descending order based on their weights is not necessary for the problem. The program could simply process the edges in any order and use the DSU to detect cycles and find the minimum weight edge in the cycle.

#### Correctness

Given the issues identified in the DFS function and the reliance on global variables, the program is not correct as it is. The program will not run correctly due to `NameError` issues, and even if these were fixed, the cycle reconstruction might not work as intended.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the critical issues with the DFS function and the reliance on global variables. The program will not produce the correct output due to these issues.

**Final: False**
