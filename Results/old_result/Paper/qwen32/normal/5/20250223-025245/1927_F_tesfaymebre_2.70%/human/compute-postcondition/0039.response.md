The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(w, u, v)` and the list `edges`. Therefore, we can only adjust these objects for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `edges` contains at least one tuple `(w, u, v)` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `edges` must contain at least one more tuple `(w, u, v)` to process. The values of `w`, `u`, and `v` will be the next tuple in the list `edges`.

Let's denote the next tuple in the list `edges` as `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`. The state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\). `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`. `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes. `u`, `v`, and `w` are the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration of the loop. `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements and reflects the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`. If `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v` before the union, and `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` and `node_u` is set to `u` and `node_v` is set to `v`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains `float('inf')` and `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`. If `parent_u` was not equal to `parent_v` before the union, then `dsu.find(u)` and `dsu.find(v)` will return the same value after the union, and `_min_edge` remains `float('inf')` and `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`.**

Since the loop processes each tuple in `edges` one by one, we can adjust the state to reflect the next tuple to be processed:

State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\). `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`. `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes. `u` is `u_next`, `v` is `v_next`, and `w` is `w_next`. `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class initialized with `n + 1` elements and reflects the union of the sets containing `u` and `v` from the previous iteration. `_min_edge` and `node_u` and `node_v` are updated based on the union operation as described.**

However, since we are only adjusting the state of the objects in the loop head, we can simplify the state to reflect the next tuple in `edges`:

State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_3()` such that \(3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min\left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}, 2 \times 10^5\right)\). `graph` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory. `edges` is a list containing at least one tuple `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`. `u` is `u_next`, `v` is `v_next`, and `w` is `w_next`.**
