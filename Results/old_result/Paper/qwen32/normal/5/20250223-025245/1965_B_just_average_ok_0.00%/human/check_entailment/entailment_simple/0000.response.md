### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided solution and verify if it meets the requirements of the problem.

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\). This is a common approach to generate a set of numbers that can form any sum up to \(2^{24} - 1\), which is more than sufficient for the given constraints (since \(n \leq 10^6\)).

2. **Finding the index `idx`**:
   - The code finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \(k\). This is done by incrementing `idx` until \(2^{idx}\) is greater than \(k\), then decrementing `idx` by 1. This gives us the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\).

3. **Adjusting `nums` to avoid the sum `k`**:
   - The code then removes \(2^{idx}\) from `nums`.
   - It adds three new numbers to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that \(k\) cannot be formed by summing any subset of the elements.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that \(k + 1\) can be formed by summing the appropriate subset of the elements.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that a larger number, which is also not \(k\), can be formed.

4. **Output**:
   - The code prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of `nums`.

### Analysis:

- **Condition 1**: There is no subsequence of `nums` with a sum of \(k\).
  - The removal of \(2^{idx}\) and the addition of `k - nums[idx]` ensure that \(k\) cannot be formed by summing any subset of the elements. This is because the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) is removed, and the new number `k - nums[idx]` cannot be combined with the remaining elements to form \(k\).

- **Condition 2**: For all \(1 \leq v \leq n\) where \(v \neq k\), there is a subsequence of `nums` with a sum of \(v\).
  - The initial set of elements in `nums` (powers of 2) can form any sum up to \(2^{24} - 1\). By removing \(2^{idx}\) and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, we ensure that \(k\) cannot be formed, but all other sums up to \(n\) (except \(k\)) can still be formed.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution meets both conditions of the problem. It ensures that there is no subsequence with a sum of \(k\) while allowing all other sums from 1 to \(n\) (except \(k\)) to be formed by some subsequence of the elements.

**Correctness: True**
