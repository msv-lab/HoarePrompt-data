To determine the final output state after the loop executes all iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop increments `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx` (which is equivalent to `2^idx`).

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, `idx` will continue to increment until `k` is less than `2^idx`. The maximum value of `idx` that can be reached is determined by the maximum value of `k` and the fact that `nums` contains powers of 2 up to `8388608` (which is `2^23`). Therefore, the maximum possible value of `idx` is 24, because `2^24` is `16777216`, which is not in the `nums` list.

To find the exact final value of `idx`, we need to determine the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. The loop will stop when `k < 2^idx`.

From the given output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration, `k` is at least 1.
- After 2 iterations, `k` is at least 2.
- After 3 iterations, `k` is at least 4.

Following this pattern, after `n` iterations, `k` must be at least `2^n`. Therefore, the loop will stop when `k < 2^idx`.

The final value of `idx` will be the largest integer such that `2^idx <= k`. This is equivalent to `idx = floor(log2(k)) + 1`.

Since the maximum value of `idx` that can be reached is 24, the final output state will be when `idx` is the largest integer such that `2^idx <= k`, and `idx` will not exceed 24.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]; `idx` is the largest integer such that 2^idx <= k and idx <= 24.**

In simpler terms, `idx` will be the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`, up to a maximum of 24.
