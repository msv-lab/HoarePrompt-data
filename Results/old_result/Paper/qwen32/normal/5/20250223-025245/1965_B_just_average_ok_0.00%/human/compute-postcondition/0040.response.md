The `while` loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`. Here, `1 << idx` is a bitwise left shift operation, which effectively computes \(2^{\text{idx}}\).

Given:
- `idx` is initially 0.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `k >= 1 << idx` must be true when `idx` is 0. Since `idx` is 0, `1 << idx` evaluates to `1 << 0`, which is 1. Therefore, the condition simplifies to `k >= 1`.

Since `k` is the second integer from the input, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1. The state of `t` and `nums` do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the only requirement is that `k` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and `k` must be at least 1; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]; `idx` is 0**
