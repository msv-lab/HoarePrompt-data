The code snippet provided is:

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
```

This code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `nums` is a list defined with specific values and conditions.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The list `nums` is not affected by this code snippet as it is defined after the input is taken.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + 2]` with the element `1 << idx` removed.**
