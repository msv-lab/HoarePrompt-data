The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. Specifically, it appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the end of `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `idx`) remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, the value of `nums[idx]` is `2 ** idx` because `nums` contains powers of 2. Therefore, the new value being appended is `k + 2 ** idx + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, `k + 2 ** idx + 1`]; `idx` is the highest integer such that 1 << (`idx` + 1) is less than or equal to `k`.**
