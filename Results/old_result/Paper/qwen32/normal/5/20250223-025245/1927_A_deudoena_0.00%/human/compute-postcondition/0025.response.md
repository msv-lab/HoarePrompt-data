Output State: **`inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t` and must have at least 1 character, `i` is 1, `j` is the last character of `inpstr`, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 1, `outind` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `inpstr`, `i`, `j`, `ind1`, `ind2`, and `outind` do not change. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
