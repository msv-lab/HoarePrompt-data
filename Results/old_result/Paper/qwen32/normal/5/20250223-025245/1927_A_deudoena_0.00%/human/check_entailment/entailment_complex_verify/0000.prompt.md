You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, there is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, followed by a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each test case is black.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t`, `i` is `len(inpstr) - 1`, `j` is the last character of `inpstr`, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: `inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t`, `i` is `len(inpstr) - 1`, `j` is the last character of `inpstr`, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: the length of the string representation of the integer `t`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an input string representing multiple test cases. For each test case, it calculates and prints the length of the strip minus the sum of the positions of the first and last black cells ('B') in the strip.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white for the entire strip to become white. The program only calculates the distance between the first and last black cell and subtracts this from the total length of the strip, which is not necessarily the minimum segment that needs to be painted white.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
WWBWB
```
Expected Output:
```
3
```
Explanation of expected output: The minimum segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white is from the 3rd to the 5th cell ("BWB"), which is of length 3.

However, the given program would output:
```
3
```
But let's consider another case:
```
Input:
1
5
BWBWB
```
Expected Output:
```
5
```
Explanation of expected output: The entire strip needs to be painted white, which is of length 5.

However, the program would output:
```
3
```
This is incorrect because the entire strip needs to be painted white.

The program fails to account for scenarios where the minimum segment might be smaller than the distance between the first and last black cells, especially when there are multiple groups of black cells separated by white cells. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
