The value of `ind2` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `inpstr` is a string containing the integer `t` and must have at least 1 character, `i` is 1, `j` is the last character of `inpstr`, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 1, `outind` is 0. If the last character of `inpstr` is 'B', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
