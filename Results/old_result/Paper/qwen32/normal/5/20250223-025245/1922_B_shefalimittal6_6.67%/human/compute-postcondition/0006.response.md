The code snippet increments the count of the integer `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If `x` is not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it initializes the count to 1. Otherwise, it increments the existing count by 1.

Given the initial state, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary. After executing the code snippet, the dictionary `num_of_lens` will have `x` as a key with its value incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is 1 if `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`, or incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one integer.**
