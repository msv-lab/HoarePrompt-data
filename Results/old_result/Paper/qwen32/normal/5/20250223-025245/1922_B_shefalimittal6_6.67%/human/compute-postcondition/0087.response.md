The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` modifies the value of `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified.

Given that `total_sum` is `1`, the expression simplifies to `res += math.comb(cnt, 2)`.

Output State: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`, `cnt` is greater than or equal to `2`, `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 2)`, `total_sum` is `1`**.

In natural language: The value of `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2)` to it. All other variables retain their initial values.
