Output State: **`t` is `len(nums) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary of counts, `nums` remains the input list, and `res` is updated to the accumulated sum based on the counts in `num_of_lens`**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the user's input. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
