Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `t` equals the length of `nums`; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, where the value is the count of a unique integer in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 if the if condition was met; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**
