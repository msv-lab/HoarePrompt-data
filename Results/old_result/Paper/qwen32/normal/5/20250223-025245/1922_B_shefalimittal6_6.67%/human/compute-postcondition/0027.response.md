The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `cnt` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`, at the start of the next iteration, `cnt` should be set to the subsequent value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.

Since the state at the end of the previous iteration provides that `cnt` is the current value in the sequence, we need to move to the next value in the dictionary's values.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to its old value plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`**.

To adjust for the next iteration, we need to set `cnt` to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to its old value plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`**.

Since `cnt` is the current value and we need the next one, let's denote the next value as `next_cnt`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is `next_cnt`, the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to its old value plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`**.

Since we don't have the exact sequence or the current position in the sequence, we can denote the next value in a generic way. The state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to its old value plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`**

Since we need to adjust only `cnt` to the next value in the sequence:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.**
