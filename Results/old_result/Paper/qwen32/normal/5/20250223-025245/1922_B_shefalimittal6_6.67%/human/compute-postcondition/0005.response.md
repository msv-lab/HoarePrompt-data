In the given for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over the elements in the list `nums`. To ensure that the loop executes, the list `nums` must contain at least one element. The other variables `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and the initial state of `nums` (being empty) need to be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `x`**: This is the loop variable that will take on the value of each element in the list `nums` during each iteration. No specific adjustment is needed for `x` itself, but the list `nums` must have elements for the loop to execute.

2. **List `nums`**: For the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one integer. The initial state of `nums` is given as an empty list, so it needs to be adjusted to contain at least one integer.

3. **Variable `t`**: This variable is described as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The value of `t` does not directly affect the execution of the for loop, but it must comply with the given constraints. No adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

4. **Variable `n`**: This variable is mentioned as an input integer, but it does not directly affect the execution of the for loop. No adjustment is needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes.

5. **Dictionary `num_of_lens`**: This variable is described as an empty dictionary. The value of `num_of_lens` does not directly affect the execution of the for loop, but it must comply with the given constraints. No adjustment is needed for `num_of_lens` to ensure the loop executes.

Given the above considerations, the state needs to be adjusted such that `nums` contains at least one integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one integer**
