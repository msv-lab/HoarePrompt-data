Postcondition: **`t` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is `{5: 1}`, `nums` is `[5]`. If `cnt` is `0`, `res` is `0` and `total_sum` is `1`. If `cnt` is `1`, `res` is `1` and `total_sum` is `0`. If `cnt` is `2`, `res` is `1` and `total_sum` is `1`. If `cnt` is `>= 3`, `res` is `2 * math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` and `total_sum` is `1`.**
