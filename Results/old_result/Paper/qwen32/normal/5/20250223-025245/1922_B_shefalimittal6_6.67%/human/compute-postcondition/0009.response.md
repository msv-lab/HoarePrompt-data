The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which is the next element in the list `nums`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether there are more elements in the list `nums` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the current element being processed, and for the loop to execute again, there must be another element in `nums` to assign to `x`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value is incremented by 1 if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, or set to 1 if `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least two integers; `x` is the next element in `nums` after the current one.**
