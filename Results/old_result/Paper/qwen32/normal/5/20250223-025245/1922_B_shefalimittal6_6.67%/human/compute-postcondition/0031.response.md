Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `cnt` is the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for `cnt`. `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**

In natural language: The value of `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to it. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
