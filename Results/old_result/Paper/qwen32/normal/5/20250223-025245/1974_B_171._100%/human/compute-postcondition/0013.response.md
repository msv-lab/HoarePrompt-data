Functionality: **The function takes a list of strings `encoded`, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters, and returns a single string `decoded`. Each character in the input strings is replaced by its corresponding character from a mapping where each unique character in the input is mapped to its reverse counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.**
