The code snippet updates the `char_map` dictionary by mapping `unique_chars[i]` to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`. This means that the value associated with the key `unique_chars[i]` in the `char_map` dictionary is changed to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.

Given the initial state, `char_map` already has mappings for each character in `unique_chars` to its corresponding character from the end of the `unique_chars` list. The code snippet updates the mapping for `unique_chars[i]` specifically.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique lowercase Latin characters found in `encoded` that must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.

In natural language: The `char_map` dictionary now has `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
