Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the string as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the `func_1` function where the mapping of characters is incorrect. The function maps each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character from the sorted unique characters, but it does so in reverse, which is not what the problem requires. Instead, it should map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding original character based on the symmetric mapping from the string `r`.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`. The distinct characters in `b` sorted alphabetically form the string `r = "cdefors"`. The decoding process should map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `s` using the symmetric mapping from `r`. The correct mapping should be:
- 's' -> 'c'
- 'e' -> 'o'
- 'r' -> 'd'
- 'o' -> 'e'
- 'f' -> 'f'
- 'd' -> 'r'
- 'e' -> 'o'
- 's' -> 'c'
- 'o' -> 'e'
- 'c' -> 's'

However, the provided code will map 's' to 's', 'e' to 'r', 'r' to 'o', etc., which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
    # Create the reverse mapping for decoding
    reverse_char_map = {v: k for k, v in char_map.items()}
    decoded = ''.join((reverse_char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded
```

This corrected version creates a reverse mapping from the encoded characters to the original characters, ensuring that the decoding is performed correctly. Since the original code does not handle this correctly, the correctness is False.
