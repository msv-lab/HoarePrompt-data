The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The variables `kq`, `itest`, `ntest`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers; `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1`; `itest` is `itest + 1`; `ntest` remains the same; `n` is an input integer.**
