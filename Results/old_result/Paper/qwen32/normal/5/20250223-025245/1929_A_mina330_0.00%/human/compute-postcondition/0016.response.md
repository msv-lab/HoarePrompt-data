The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The variables `kq`, `itest`, `ntest`, and `n` remain unchanged by this code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the sorted list `a` moving towards the center; `itest` is `itest_prev + 1`; `ntest` remains the same; `n` is an input integer.**
