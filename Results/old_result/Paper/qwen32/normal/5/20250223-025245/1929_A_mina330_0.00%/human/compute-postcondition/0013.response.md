To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `kq` is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the sorted list `a` moving towards the center.

Let's assume the list `a` is given as an example for clarity. Suppose `a = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]`.

1. First, sort the list `a`. The sorted list will be `a_sorted = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]`.
2. Next, compute the differences between corresponding elements from the start and the end of the sorted list `a_sorted` moving towards the center. This means we compute:
   - \(a_sorted[0] - a_sorted[7] = 1 - 9 = -8\)
   - \(a_sorted[1] - a_sorted[6] = 1 - 6 = -5\)
   - \(a_sorted[2] - a_sorted[5] = 2 - 5 = -3\)
   - \(a_sorted[3] - a_sorted[4] = 3 - 4 = -1\)

3. Sum these differences: \(-8 + (-5) + (-3) + (-1) = -17\).

Thus, `kq` is the sum of these differences, which is \(-17\).

However, since the exact list `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `kq`. We can only describe the process and the definition of `kq`.

The `print(kq)` statement will print the value of `kq`, which is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the sorted list `a` moving towards the center.

Output: **kq (where kq is the sum of the differences between the corresponding elements from the end and the start of the sorted list `a` moving towards the center)**
