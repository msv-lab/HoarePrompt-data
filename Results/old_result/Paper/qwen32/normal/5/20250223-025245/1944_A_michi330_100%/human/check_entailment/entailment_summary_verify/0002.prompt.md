You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step based on the problem description.

The problem revolves around determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. Initially, all islands are connected, and Everule starts on island 1.

The key insight is that the islands can be thought of as nodes in a complete graph, and the bridges as edges. Dominater's goal is to disconnect as many islands from island 1 as possible by destroying up to `k` bridges.

### Analysis:
1. **When `k < n - 1`:**
   - If Dominater destroys fewer than `n - 1` bridges, it's impossible to disconnect island 1 from all other islands because there will always be at least one path from island 1 to any other island. This is because removing fewer than `n - 1` edges from a complete graph will not isolate any node.
   - Therefore, Everule can still reach all `n` islands.

2. **When `k >= n - 1`:**
   - If Dominater destroys `n - 1` or more bridges, he can disconnect island 1 from all other islands. This is because removing `n - 1` edges from a complete graph isolates one node (in this case, island 1), making it unreachable from any other node.
   - Thus, Everule can only visit island 1.

### Program Evaluation:
The provided program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases, `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (number of islands) and `k` (number of bridges Dominater can destroy).
- It checks if `k >= n - 1`. If true, it prints `1` (Everule can only visit island 1).
- Otherwise, it prints `n` (Everule can visit all islands).

### Conclusion:
The program accurately reflects the problem's requirements and handles all edge cases correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
