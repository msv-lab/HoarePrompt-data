Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. Specifically, Case_1: If `k` is within the range 0 to \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), it returns a specific result (which is not detailed here); Case_2: If `k` is outside this range, it implies an invalid input scenario, and the function should handle this case appropriately.**
