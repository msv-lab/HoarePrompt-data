Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:

- `t` is an integer input provided such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3.
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is less than `n - 1`.

The `print` statement in the code is:
```python
print(n)
```

From the initial state, `n` is explicitly mentioned to be the first integer from the input. Since no specific value for `n` is provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n`, which is the first integer from the input.

Output: **n (where n is the first integer from the input)**
