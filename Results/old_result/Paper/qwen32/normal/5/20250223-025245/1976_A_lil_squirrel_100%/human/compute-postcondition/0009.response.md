The code snippet `digits.append(ch)` appends the character `ch` to the list `digits`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `ch` is the next character in the string `password` and `password` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` could be either a letter or a digit. However, because the operation specifically appends `ch` to `digits`, `ch` must be a digit at this point in the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch` if `ch` is not a digit, and `digits` is a list containing the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, `ch` is the next character in the string `password`, and `ch` is a digit that has been appended to `digits`.**
