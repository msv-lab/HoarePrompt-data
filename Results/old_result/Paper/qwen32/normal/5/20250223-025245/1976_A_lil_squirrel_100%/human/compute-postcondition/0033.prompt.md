Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits. The list `letters` is sorted, and the list `digits` is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(password) - 1):
    if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits. Both `letters` and `digits` are sorted. At least one of the following is true for every index `i` in `password`: either `password[i]` is not a letter or `password[i + 1]` is not a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits. Both `letters` and `digits` are sorted. If `password[i]` is a letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO' for the given condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits. Both `letters` and `digits` are sorted. If `password[i]` is a letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO' for the given condition, and `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
