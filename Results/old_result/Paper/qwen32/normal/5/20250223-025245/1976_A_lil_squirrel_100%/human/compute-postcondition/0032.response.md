Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all the characters from `password` that are digits. Both `letters` and `digits` are sorted. If `password[i]` is a letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return 'NO' for the given condition, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
