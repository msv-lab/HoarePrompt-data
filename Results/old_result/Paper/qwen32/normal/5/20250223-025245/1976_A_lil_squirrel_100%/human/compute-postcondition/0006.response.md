Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch`, `digits` is an empty list, and the character `ch` is not a digit.**

Explanation: The character `ch` is appended to the `letters` list, changing its state from an empty list to a list containing `ch`. All other variables remain unchanged.
