The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. The variables `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains one element, which is the value of `max`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is any even integer except 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `i` is `i + 1`**
