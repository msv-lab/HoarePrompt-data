The value of `min` is updated to `-100000000`. Other variables like `t`, `x`, `max`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations needed to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values corresponding to each iteration, and `i` is `i` + 1**.
