Output State: **`t` is 1; `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999]. If `x` is odd, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000].**

Explanation:
- The value of `max` is decremented by 1. If `x` was even, `max` was 99999999 and is now 99999998. If `x` was odd, `max` was 100000000 and remains 99999999.
- The values of `t`, `x`, `min`, and `ans` are unchanged.
