Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000], and `i` is `i` + 1**

Natural language: The value of `t` remains 1, `x` is still not equal to 1, `max` retains its value based on whether `x` is even or odd, `min` also retains its value based on whether `x` is even or odd, `ans` now includes the value of `max` appended to it, and `i` is incremented by 1.
