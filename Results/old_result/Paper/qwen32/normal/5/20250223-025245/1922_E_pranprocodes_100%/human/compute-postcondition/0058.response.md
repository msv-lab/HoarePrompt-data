`max` is decremented by 1. The value of `max` was either 99999999 or 100000000 before the decrement, so now it is either 99999998 or 99999999. The values of `t`, `x`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either [100000000, max] or [-100000000, max], and `i` is `i + 1`.**
