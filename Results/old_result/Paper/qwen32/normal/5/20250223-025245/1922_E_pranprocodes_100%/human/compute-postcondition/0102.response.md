Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `x` is either `x // 2` if `x` was even, or `x - 1` if `x` was odd, `max` is 99999998 if `x` (after modification) is even, 99999999 if `x` (before modification) was odd, 100000000 if `x` (before modification) was even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` (after modification) is odd, -99999998 if `x` (before modification) was even, -100000000 if `x` (before modification) was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if `x` was even, [100000000, -99999999] if `x` was odd and `x` (before modification) was even, [-100000000, 100000000] if `x` was even and `x` (before modification) was odd, [-100000000, -100000000] if `x` was odd and `x` (before modification) was odd, and `i` is `i` + 1.**
