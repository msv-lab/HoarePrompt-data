The code snippet `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Given the initial state, `t` was 0, so after the execution, `t` becomes 1. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the conditions described.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is any integer except 1, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is either [100000000] or [-100000000], and `i` is `i + 1`. If `x` is even, `max` becomes 99999999 and `ans` becomes [100000000]. Otherwise, `min` becomes -99999999 and `ans` becomes [-100000000].**
