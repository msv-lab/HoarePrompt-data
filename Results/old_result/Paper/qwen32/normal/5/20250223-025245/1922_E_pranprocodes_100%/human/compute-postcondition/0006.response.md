The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1.

Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `x` must be any integer except 1.

State: **`t` is 0; `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 1; `max` is 100000000; `min` is -100000000; `ans` is an empty list**
