The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is not equal to 1, so no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is 1; `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is [100000000]. If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is [-100000000]**
