The code snippet `ans.reverse()` reverses the order of the elements in the list `ans`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `max`, and `min`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is 1, `max` is reduced by the number of even `x` encountered, `min` is incremented by the number of odd `x` encountered, and `ans` is a list of values appended during each iteration in reverse order.**
