Output State: **`t` is 1; `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is [100000000, 99999999]. If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` is [-100000000, 100000000].**

In simpler terms: The variable `ans` now includes `max` as its second element. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
