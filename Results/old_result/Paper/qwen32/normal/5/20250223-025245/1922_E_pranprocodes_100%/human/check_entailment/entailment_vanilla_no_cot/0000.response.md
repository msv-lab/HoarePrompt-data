Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem of finding an array with exactly X increasing subsequences. The program uses a binary representation approach, which does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly X increasing subsequences. Instead, the program should construct an array where the number of increasing subsequences can be precisely controlled, such as using a combination of repeated and strictly increasing elements to achieve the desired count of subsequences. The given solution does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input X for all test cases.
