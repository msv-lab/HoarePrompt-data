Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the program to see if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem states that we need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly one cube. To have `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because even if we start with no cubes and only add cubes, we need `m` moves to get `m` cubes. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have `m` cubes because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves we have.

The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and if so, it prints "Yes", indicating that it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it prints "No", indicating that it is not possible.

This logic aligns with the problem statement. If `n >= m`, it is possible to end up with `m` cubes (by adding cubes in each move), and if `n < m`, it is not possible because we don't have enough moves to add `m` cubes.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
