Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the annotated version step-by-step to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis
The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. The goal is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. 

### Key Points
1. **Addition and Removal**: Nikita can add or remove one cube per move.
2. **Parity Consideration**: If `m` is 0, `n` must be even because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change.
3. **Possible Values of `m`**: The value of `m` can range from `-n` to `n` because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is `n` and the maximum number of cubes that can be removed is also `n`.

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program checks if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" if true and "No" otherwise. This logic is flawed because:
- It does not account for the possibility of removing cubes (i.e., `m` can be negative).
- It does not consider the parity requirement for `m = 0`.

### Annotations
The annotations indicate that the program checks if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly. However, the annotations do not address the logical flaws in the program.

### Counterexamples
- **Input**: `2 0`
  - **Expected Output**: `Yes` (Nikita can add a cube and then remove it, resulting in 0 cubes).
  - **Actual Output**: `No` (since 2 is not less than 0).
- **Input**: `3 -1`
  - **Expected Output**: `Yes` (Nikita can add a cube twice and then remove one, resulting in -1 cubes).
  - **Actual Output**: `No` (since 3 is not less than -1).

### Correct Logic
To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Check if `m` is within the range `[-n, n]`.
2. If `m` is 0, ensure that `n` is even.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
