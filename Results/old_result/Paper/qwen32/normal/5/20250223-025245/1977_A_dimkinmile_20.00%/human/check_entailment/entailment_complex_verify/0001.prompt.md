You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is less than `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input for each of `t` test cases. It prints "Yes" if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and "No" otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the number of moves `n` is greater than or equal to the number of cubes `m` required in the final tower. However, this approach is not entirely correct. 

To determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider that each move can either add or remove one cube. Therefore, the difference between the number of moves `n` and the number of cubes `m` must be even. This is because adding and removing cubes in pairs will result in a net change of zero cubes, and any remaining moves must result in a net change that is an even number of cubes.

For example:
- If `n = 5` and `m = 3`, it is possible: three moves to add cubes, and two moves to remove cubes (or vice versa).
- If `n = 2` and `m = 4`, it is not possible: there are not enough moves to add four cubes without removing any, and any removal would result in fewer than four cubes.

The current implementation of `func_1()` only checks if `n >= m`, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of building the tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It fails to account for the requirement that the difference between `n` and `m` must be even.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
