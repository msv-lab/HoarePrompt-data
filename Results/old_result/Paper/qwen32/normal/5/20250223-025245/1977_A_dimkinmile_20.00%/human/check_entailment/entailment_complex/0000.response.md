Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw in its condition to determine whether it's possible for Nikita to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The condition `if (n >= m):` does not correctly capture all scenarios where it's possible to end up with `m` cubes. 

Nikita can either add or remove a cube in each move. Therefore, it's possible for him to end up with `m` cubes if and only if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because every time he adds or removes a cube, he is changing the number of cubes by 1, and to get from 0 to `m` (or any other number) exactly, he needs an even number of moves if `n` (total moves) and `m` (final height) have different parities (one is odd and the other is even). If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are odd or both are even), then it's possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes in `n` moves.

Given the test cases:
- For `n=3` and `m=3`, it's possible to add 3 cubes, so the output should be "Yes".
- For `n=2` and `m=4`, it's impossible to end up with 4 cubes using only 2 moves, so the output should be "No".
- For `n=5` and `m=3`, it's possible to add 3 cubes and remove 2, so the output should be "Yes".

The current program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for `n=2` and `m=4`, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
