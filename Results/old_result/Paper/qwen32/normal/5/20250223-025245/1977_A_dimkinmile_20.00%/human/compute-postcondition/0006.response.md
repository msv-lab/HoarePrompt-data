The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters as per the provided function definition. It seems to be designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes integers `n` and `m`. However, since the function definition does not include parameters, we can infer that these values are likely to be read from an input source within the function body.

Given the constraints and the output description, we can describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (with constraints 1 <= n, m <= 100). For each test case, it performs some operation and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`. Specifically, if `n` is less than 0, it returns an error message indicating that ages can't be negative (though this case seems inconsistent with the given constraints). If `n` is between 0 and 18, it returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".** 

However, since the function definition does not include parameters, a more accurate description without assumptions about internal operations would be:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` (with constraints 1 <= n, m <= 100). For each test case, it performs operations based on the values of `n` and `m` and returns a result.**
