Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" if true and "No" otherwise. However, the problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, the number of cubes `m` can be achieved if `n` is at least `abs(m)`, and `n` must be even if `m` is 0 because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:
- Input: `2 0`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (because Nikita can add a cube and then remove it, resulting in 0 cubes)
- Actual Output: `No` (since 2 is not less than 0)

Thus, the program is incorrect for cases where `m` is 0 and `n` is even, as well as for cases where `m` is negative (which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem but logically possible given the operations allowed).
