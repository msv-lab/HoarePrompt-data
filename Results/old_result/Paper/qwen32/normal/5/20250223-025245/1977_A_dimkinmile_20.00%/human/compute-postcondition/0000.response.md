The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `n` and `m` based on the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.**
