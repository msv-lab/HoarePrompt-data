To determine the postcondition, we need to consider the initial state of the program variables as described in the precondition, and then add the negation of the if condition to it. Here's the breakdown:

**Precondition:** The list is initialized with all elements as 0, i.e., `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`

**If condition:** `if (func_1(list, n)):`

Since we are not entering the if block, we need to consider the scenario where `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`. The postcondition should reflect this.

**Postcondition:** The list is initialized with all elements as 0, and `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.

To put it simply in natural language:

Postcondition: **The list contains all elements as 0, and the function `func_1` returns `False` when called with this list and `n`.**
