Postcondition: **The list is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, and the element at index `i - 1` (which is 1) in the list is not 0.** 

However, based on the precondition stating that the list is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, it's not possible for `list[i - 1]` (which is `list[1]`) to be not 0. This implies that the if condition cannot be true given the provided precondition. Nonetheless, if we strictly follow the task to include the if condition, the postcondition would be as stated above.
