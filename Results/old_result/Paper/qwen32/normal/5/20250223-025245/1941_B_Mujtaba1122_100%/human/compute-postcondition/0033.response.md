Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step.

### Initial State:
1. The list consists of zeros.
2. `i` is 1.
3. The element at index 0 of the list is not 0.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('no')`.
- The string `'no'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.

### Explanation:
- The value to be printed is directly specified in the `print` statement.
- The variables `i` and the list are not used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'no'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **no**
