Given the code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`, we can simplify the expression to `list[i - 1] = 0` because `1 * list[i - 1]` is just `list[i - 1]`. This means the element at index `i - 1` of the list is set to 0.

Initial State: The list is `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3.

Since `i` is 2, `list[i - 1]` refers to `list[1]`, which is initially 1. After the operation, `list[1]` becomes 0.

The other elements of the list and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **The list is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3.**
