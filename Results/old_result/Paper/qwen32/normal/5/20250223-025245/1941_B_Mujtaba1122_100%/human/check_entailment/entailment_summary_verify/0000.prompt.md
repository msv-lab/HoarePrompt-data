You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1
    
    5
    
    0 1 3 3 1

    5 6 0 2 3 0
    
    4
    
    1 2 7 2
    
    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` processes a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (where `n` is at least 3) by modifying its elements based on specific conditions. If during this process any element at position `i-1` is not zero after a certain operation, it prints 'no' and terminates. Otherwise, it calls another function `func_1` with the modified list and `n`. Depending on the return value of `func_1`, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Operation Logic Error**:
   - In the `func_2` function, the operation logic is incorrect. The operation is supposed to decrement `a_{i-1}` by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1. However, the code incorrectly modifies these values by multiplying them with `list[i - 1]`.
   - Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     ```

2. **Early Termination**:
   - The code checks if `list[i - 1] != 0` after processing each index `i` and prints 'no' if it is not zero. This is incorrect because the operation can be applied multiple times to different indices, and a non-zero value at `list[i - 1]` might be reduced to zero in subsequent operations.
   - The check `if list[i - 1] != 0:` should be removed or moved to a more appropriate place in the logic.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The final check to see if all elements are zero should be done after all possible operations have been applied. The current implementation does not ensure that all elements are zero after processing the array.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The correct sequence of operations would be:
1. Apply the operation at `i=3` to get `[1, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
2. Apply the operation at `i=3` again to get `[1, 3, 1, 1, 2]`.
3. Apply the operation at `i=2` to get `[0, 1, 0, 1, 2]`.
4. Apply the operation at `i=3` to get `[0, 1, -1, -1, 2]` (which is invalid as values cannot be negative).
5. Apply the operation at `i=2` again to get `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

However, the provided code would incorrectly terminate early because it checks `list[i - 1]` after each operation, leading to incorrect results.

### Corrected Code Example:
Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def can_make_all_zero(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n < 3:
        return "NO" if any(arr) else "YES"
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] > 1 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
    
    return "YES" if all(x == 0 for x in arr) else "NO"

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(can_make_all_zero(arr))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Uncomment the following line to run the main function
# main()
```

This corrected code properly applies the operations and checks if all elements can be made zero.
