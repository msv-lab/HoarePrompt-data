The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the value at index `i - 1` of the list by subtracting its current value from itself, effectively setting it to 0. Given that `i` is 2, the value at index `1` of the list is modified.

Initial State: The list is `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3.

After execution, the value at index `1` of the list, which was `1`, is now `0`.

Output State: **The list is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3.**
