### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
- The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`) and perform the following:
  - `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`
  - `a_i = a_i - 2`
  - `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - This function seems correct for its intended purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates through the list from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation while the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0` are met.
   - The operation in the code is incorrect:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     This should be:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     ```
   - The function checks if `list[i - 1] != 0` after each operation and prints 'no' if it is not zero. This is incorrect because the operation can be applied multiple times to different indices, and a non-zero value at `list[i - 1]` might be reduced to zero in subsequent operations.
   - The final check to see if all elements are zero should be done after all possible operations have been applied.

#### Evaluation Against Function Summaries:
- The function summary for `func_2` states that it processes the list by modifying its elements based on specific conditions and prints 'no' if any element at position `i-1` is not zero after a certain operation. This description is partially correct but incomplete, as it does not account for the incorrect operation logic and the incorrect early termination condition.

#### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the operation logic and the early termination condition.
- The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations.

### Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the original assessment.
