The function `func_2` processes a list of non-negative integers of length `n` (where `n` is at least 3) by modifying its elements based on specific conditions. If during this process any element at position `i-1` is not zero after a certain operation, it prints 'no' and terminates. Otherwise, it calls another function `func_1` with the modified list and `n`. Depending on the return value of `func_1`, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
