To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables. The loop runs `t` times, and each iteration processes a specific test case involving an integer `n` and a list `T` derived from the input.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in each iteration:

1. **Initialization**: `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
2. **Input Reading**: `n` is read as an integer, and `T` is read as a list of `n-1` integers.
3. **List `a` Construction**: A list `a` is constructed where `a[0]` is `1000`, and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1000` and the elements of `T` up to `T[i-1]`.
4. **Output**: The list `a` is converted to a space-separated string and printed.

The loop continues until `t` becomes zero. The variables `n`, `T`, `a`, and `result` are specific to each iteration and do not persist across iterations. The only variable that persists and is modified across iterations is `t`.

### Output State After All Iterations

After all iterations, `t` will be `0` because the loop continues until `t` is decremented to `0`. The other variables (`n`, `T`, `a`, `result`, and `line`) do not retain their values across iterations, as they are re-initialized in each iteration.

Output State: **`t` is 0.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be `0`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The other variables (`n`, `T`, `a`, `result`, and `line`) do not have a consistent state across iterations and will reflect the state of the last iteration processed.
