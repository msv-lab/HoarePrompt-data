Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a new list `a` such that each element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list, starting with `a[0]` initialized to 1000. It then prints the resulting list `a` for each test case.**
