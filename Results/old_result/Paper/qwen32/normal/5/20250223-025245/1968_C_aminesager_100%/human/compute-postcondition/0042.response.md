The code snippet appends the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 before this code runs, `a[i - 1]` refers to the last element in `a` before the increment, and `T[i - 1]` refers to the element in `T` at the index `i - 1`.

Given the initial state, `i` has already been incremented, and `n` must be greater than `i`. After the code runs, the list `a` will have a new element appended to it, which is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `T[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `i`, `a` has a new element appended which is `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`.**
