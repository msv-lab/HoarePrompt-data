The code snippet `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Since `d` initially has keys from `0` to `n`, removing the key `n` means that `d` will no longer have this key. The values of `s`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from `0` to `n-1` where each key `i` maps to the cumulative balance of parentheses up to index `i-1` in `s`.**
