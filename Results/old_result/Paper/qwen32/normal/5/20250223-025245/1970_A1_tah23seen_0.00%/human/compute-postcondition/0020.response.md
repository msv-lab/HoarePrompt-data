The code snippet sorts the dictionary `d` by its values. The keys in `d` are indices from `0` to `n-1`, and the values are the cumulative balance of parentheses up to index `i-1` in the string `s`. After sorting, `d` becomes a list of tuples where each tuple contains an index and its corresponding cumulative balance, sorted by the cumulative balance.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses.**
