The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` by adding a new key `i + 1` with a value that is one more than the value associated with the key `i`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ans` is an empty string.
- `d` is a dictionary.
- `i` is 1.
- If the current character at position `i` in `s` is "(", then `d` has keys `0` and `1` mapped to the values `0` and `1` respectively. Otherwise, `d` has keys `0` and `1` mapped to the values `0` and `-1` respectively.

After executing the code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1`, the dictionary `d` will have a new entry where `d[2]` is `d[1] + 1`. Since `i` is 1, and `d[1]` is either 1 (if `s[1]` is "(") or -1 (if `s[1]` is ")"), `d[2]` will be `2` or `0` respectively.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys `0`, `1`, and `2` mapped to the values `0`, `1` or `-1`, and `2` or `0` respectively depending on whether `s[1]` is "(" or ")`; `i` is 1.**
