The provided code snippet modifies the dictionary `d` by adding a new key-value pair. Specifically, it sets `d[i + 1]` to `d[i] - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `d[i]` (which is `d[0]`) is 0. Therefore, `d[i + 1]` (which is `d[1]`) is set to `d[0] - 1`, which results in `d[1]` being `-1`.

The other variables (`s`, `n`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet. The string `s` remains a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` remains the length of `s`, `ans` remains an empty string, and `i` remains 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the key `0` mapped to the value `0` and the key `1` mapped to the value `-1`; `i` is 0; `s[i]` is not equal to '('**
