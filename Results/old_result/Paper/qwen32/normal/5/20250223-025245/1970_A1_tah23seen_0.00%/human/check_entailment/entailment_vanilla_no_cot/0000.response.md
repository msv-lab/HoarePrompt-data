Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly computing the balanced shuffle of a parentheses sequence. Here are the main problems:

1. **Dictionary Key Error**: The program attempts to access `d[i]` before it has been defined for `i` in the dictionary `d`. This will occur for `i = 0` because the dictionary is initially only populated with `d[0] = 0`.

2. **Incorrect Sorting Criteria**: The sorting criteria used in the `sorted` function are not correct. The problem specifies that the columns should be sorted first by prefix balance in increasing order, and ties should be broken by position in decreasing order. The current sorting criteria do not reflect this requirement.

3. **Dictionary Overwriting**: The dictionary `d` is used to store prefix balances, but it should not be used to store characters directly. Instead, a list of tuples should be used to store (position, prefix balance) pairs, which can then be sorted according to the problem's requirements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balances = []
    current_balance = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            current_balance += 1
        else:
            current_balance -= 1
        prefix_balances.append((i, current_balance))
    
    # Sort by prefix balance, and break ties by position in decreasing order
    prefix_balances.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    
    # Construct the result string
    result = ''.join(s[i] for i, _ in prefix_balances)
    return result

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected program correctly computes the balanced shuffle of a parentheses sequence by maintaining a list of (position, prefix balance) pairs and sorting them according to the specified criteria.
