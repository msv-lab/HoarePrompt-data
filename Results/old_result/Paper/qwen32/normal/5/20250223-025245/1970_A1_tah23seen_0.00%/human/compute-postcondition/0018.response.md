Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from `0` to `n` where each key `i` maps to the cumulative balance of parentheses up to index `i-1` in `s`. The final value `d[n]` is `0` since `s` is balanced.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `s` remains unchanged as a balanced parentheses sequence. The variable `n` still holds the length of `s`. The variable `ans` remains an empty string as it is not modified in the loop. The dictionary `d` will have keys from `0` to `n`, where each key `i` holds the cumulative balance of the parentheses from the start of the string up to, but not including, the `i`-th character. Since `s` is a balanced sequence, the final balance `d[n]` will be `0`.
