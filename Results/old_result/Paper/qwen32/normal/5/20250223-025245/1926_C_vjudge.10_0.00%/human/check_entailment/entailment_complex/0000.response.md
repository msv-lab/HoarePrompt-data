### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem as described. However, there are a few issues with the annotated program that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization of `soma`**: The variable `soma` is initialized outside of the loop that processes each test case. This means that the sum of the digits for all test cases will be accumulated in the same `soma` variable, which is incorrect. Each test case should have its own sum.

2. **Loop Range**: The outer loop runs `N` times, which is correct for processing `N` test cases. However, the inner loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, which means it processes numbers from `0` to `n-1` instead of from `1` to `n`. The problem statement specifies that the integers from `1` to `n` are written on the board, so the loop should start from `1`.

3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is correctly defined and returns the sum of the digits of the integer `n`.

### Corrected Code:
To fix the issues, we need to:
- Move the initialization of `soma` inside the loop that processes each test case.
- Adjust the inner loop to run from `1` to `n` inclusive.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0  # Initialize soma for each test case
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Loop from 1 to n inclusive
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)  # Print the result for each test case
```

### Conclusion:
The original program, as annotated, is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected version, as shown, will produce the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
