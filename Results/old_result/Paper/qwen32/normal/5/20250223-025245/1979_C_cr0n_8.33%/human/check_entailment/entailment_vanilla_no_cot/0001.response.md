Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received in any winning outcome.
- For each outcome `i`, if it wins, the returned amount is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount bet on that outcome.
- The goal is to find `x_i` such that the sum of all `x_i` is less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values and stores it in `prod`.
   - It then creates a list `vprod` where each element is `prod // k_i`.
   - The variable `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the program outputs `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

### Correctness Check:
- The approach taken by the program is to find a set of bets `x_i` such that the total bet is less than the returned amount for any winning outcome.
- The values in `vprod` are derived as `prod // k_i`, which ensures that `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod - (prod % k_i)`.
- The sum of `vprod` is `prod - sum(prod % k_i)`, which is less than `prod`.
- However, the condition `prod - sum(vprod) > 0` is checked, which is equivalent to `sum(prod % k_i) > 0`. If this condition is not met, it correctly outputs `-1`.
- If the condition is met, the program outputs `vprod` as the bets, which satisfies the requirement that the total bet is less than the returned amount for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets or determine if no such bets are possible. The provided logic ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the returned amount for any winning outcome.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
