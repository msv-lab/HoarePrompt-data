Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements in all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the bets `x_i` is flawed. The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then uses this product to derive the bets, but this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Let's consider a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```

Explanation for the expected output:
If you bet 1 coin on each outcome, the total bet is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 coins. If any outcome wins, you receive back 2 * 1 = 2 coins for that outcome, which is not strictly greater than 3. Therefore, this specific case should output `-1` because there is no valid distribution of bets.

However, the provided program will output:
```
2 2 2
```

This is because the product of the multipliers (2 * 2 * 2 = 8) divided by each multiplier gives [4, 4, 4], and the denominator (8 - (4 + 4 + 4)) is -4, which is less than or equal to 0, so it outputs `-1`. But this is not the correct logic for determining the bets.

A correct approach would be to find a set of bets that satisfies the condition for all outcomes. One simple approach is to use the smallest possible bets that satisfy the condition. For example, for the input `2 2 2`, the bets could be `1 1 1`, but as shown, this does not work. The correct approach would involve more complex logic to ensure the condition is met for all outcomes.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
