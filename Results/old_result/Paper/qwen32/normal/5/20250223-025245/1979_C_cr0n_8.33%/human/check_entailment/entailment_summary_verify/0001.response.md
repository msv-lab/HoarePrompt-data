Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
Given `n` outcomes with multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`, we need to bet `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` coins such that the total bet is less than the coins received in any winning scenario. Mathematically, this means:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \forall i \]
which simplifies to:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \min_{i} (k_i \cdot x_i) \]

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. Here's a detailed breakdown of `func_1`:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.

2. **Calculating Product:**
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod = k_1 * k_2 * ... * k_n`.

3. **Calculating `vprod`:**
   - It calculates `vprod` as the list of `prod // k_i` for each `k_i`. This essentially means `vprod[i] = prod / k_i` for integer division.

4. **Denominator Calculation:**
   - It calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`. This step is crucial for understanding if a valid distribution of bets is possible.

5. **Checking Validity:**
   - If `den <= 0`, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `vprod` list as the bets.

### Correctness Check:
- **Sum of Bets:**
  - The sum of `vprod` is `sum(vprod) = sum(prod // k_i)`.
  - The total bet is `sum(vprod)`.

- **Return for Each Outcome:**
  - For the i-th outcome, the return would be `k_i * vprod[i] = k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod - sum(vprod) + sum(vprod) - vprod[i] = prod - sum(vprod) + vprod[i]`.
  - Since `sum(vprod) = prod - den`, the return for the i-th outcome is `prod - (prod - sum(vprod)) + vprod[i] = sum(vprod) + vprod[i]`.
  - Since `sum(vprod) > den` and `vprod[i] > 0`, `sum(vprod) + vprod[i] > sum(vprod)`, which means the return for any outcome is greater than the total bet.

- **Denominator Check:**
  - The program correctly checks if `den <= 0` to determine if a valid distribution is possible. If `den <= 0`, it means the total bet cannot be less than the return for any outcome, so it correctly outputs `-1`.

- **Valid Distribution:**
  - If `den > 0`, the program outputs `vprod`, which is a valid distribution of bets as shown above.

### Verification Against Function Summary:
The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`:
- It reads `N` and `vals`.
- It calculates `prod` as the product of all `k_i`.
- It calculates `vprod` as `prod // k_i` for each `k_i`.
- It calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
- It checks if `den <= 0` and prints `-1` if true. Otherwise, it prints `vprod`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of bets is possible and outputs a valid distribution when possible. The function summary aligns with the program's behavior, and the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
