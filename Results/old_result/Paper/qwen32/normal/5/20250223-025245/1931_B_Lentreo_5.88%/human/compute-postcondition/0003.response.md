The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `nums`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Given that `n` is an input integer, we can assume that `n` represents the number of integers that will be in the input line. Therefore, `nums` will be a list of `n` integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input.**
