The code snippet `curr += i - last` modifies the value of `curr` by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `curr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `last` is the current `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums`, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.**
