The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the elements in the list `nums`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element
- `last` is the last element of `nums`
- If `i` is not equal to 0, then `curr` is updated to `curr` + `i` - `last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element of `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `nums` if there are more elements left in the list.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in `nums` as `index`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `nums[index]`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `nums[index + 1]` if `index + 1` is within the bounds of `nums`.

Since we don't have the current `index` explicitly, we can infer that the next value of `i` will be the next element in the list `nums` after `last`. If `last` was the last element of `nums`, then the loop would have ended. Therefore, `last` is not the last element, and there is at least one more element in `nums` after `last`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `last` is the last element of `nums` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums` after `last`**
