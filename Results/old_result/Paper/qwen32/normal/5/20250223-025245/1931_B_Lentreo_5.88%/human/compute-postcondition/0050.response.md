The code snippet `curr += i - last` modifies the value of `curr` by adding the result of `i - last` to its current value. The other variables, `t`, `n`, `nums`, and `last`, remain unchanged.

Given that `curr` was initially 0, the new value of `curr` will be `i - last`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `last` is `nums[-1]`, `curr` is `i - last`, and `i` is not 0.**
