Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is `curr + i - last`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `curr` has been updated to `curr + i - last`. All other variables retain their initial values.
