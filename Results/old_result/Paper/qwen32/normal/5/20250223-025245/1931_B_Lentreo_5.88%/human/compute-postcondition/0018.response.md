The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This statement does not depend on the values of any variables or the state of the program described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr`, but these are not used in the `print` statement.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the number of integers in the list `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers.
   - `last` is the last element of the list `nums`.
   - `curr` is the accumulated sum of differences \(i - \text{last}\) for each non-zero \(i\) in `nums`, and it is initialized to 0.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
   - This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` to the console.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables or the state of the program, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
