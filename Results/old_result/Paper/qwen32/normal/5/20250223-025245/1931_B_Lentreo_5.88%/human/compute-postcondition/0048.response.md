The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the elements of the list `nums`. To ensure that the loop can execute, the list `nums` must contain at least one element. The other variables `t`, `n`, `last`, and `curr` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect whether the loop executes.

Let's break it down:

- `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is the newly input list of integers.
- `last` is `nums[-1]`.
- `curr` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least one element. The state of `i` is determined by the elements of `nums` during each iteration, so no specific adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `last` is `nums[-1]`, `curr` is 0**
