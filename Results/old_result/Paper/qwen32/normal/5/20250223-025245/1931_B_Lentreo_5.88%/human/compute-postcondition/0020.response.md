The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The variables `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` are described in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement since it directly prints the string `'NO'` without using any of these variables.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable Descriptions**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
   - `n` is the number of integers in the list `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `last` is the last element of the list `nums`.
   - `curr` is the accumulated sum of differences `i - last` for each non-zero `i` in `nums` and is not equal to 0.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print('NO')` directly prints the string `'NO'` to the output.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, or `curr`, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
