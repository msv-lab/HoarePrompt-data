You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` test cases have been processed. For each test case, "YES" is printed if the sum of differences `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums` equals 0; otherwise, "NO" is printed. The variables `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` will reflect the state of the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in the list and the last element equals zero. If it does, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The program incorrectly calculates the `curr` variable by iterating through the list and subtracting the last element from each non-zero element. This approach does not accurately reflect the logic needed to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

### Counterexample:
Input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Explanation:
- The sum of the water in the containers is 6, which is divisible by 3 (the number of containers).
- However, it is not possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers using the given operation (pouring water from an earlier container to a later one).

The program will output `YES` for this input, which is incorrect.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the process of redistributing water. It incorrectly calculates the difference between each element and the last element, which does not reflect the actual redistribution process required by the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if, for each prefix of the array, the sum of the elements in that prefix is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in the entire array divided by the number of containers (the target amount each container should have). This ensures that you can redistribute the water from earlier containers to later ones without exceeding the target amount at any point.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total = sum(nums)
        target = total // n
        curr_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            curr_sum += nums[i]
            if curr_sum > target * (i + 1):
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected program correctly checks if the water can be evenly distributed by ensuring that at no point does the sum of the water in the first `i+1` containers exceed the target amount multiplied by `i+1`.
