The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `curr`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, and `last`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `last` is the last element of `nums`; `curr` is 0.**
