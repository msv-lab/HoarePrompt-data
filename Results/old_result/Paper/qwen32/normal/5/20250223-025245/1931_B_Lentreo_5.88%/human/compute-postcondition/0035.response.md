The code snippet `curr += i - last` updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, the value of `curr` is updated as follows:
- If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` becomes `curr + (i - last)`.
- If `i` is equal to 0, `curr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `last` is the current `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `nums` after `last`, `curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)` if `i` is not 0, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged.**
