The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python to indicate that the loop variable is intentionally unused. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

The state of `n` and `a` (the list of integers) is not relevant to whether the loop will execute; those are details that would be handled within the loop body, which is omitted here.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
