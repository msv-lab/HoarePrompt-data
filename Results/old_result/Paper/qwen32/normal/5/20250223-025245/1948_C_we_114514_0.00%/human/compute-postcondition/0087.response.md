The given code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This change affects the value of `reachable_second_row` while all other variables retain their initial states.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case.
- `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is `False`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`.
- `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`.
- `reachable_first_row` is `True`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

The code modifies `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`.**
