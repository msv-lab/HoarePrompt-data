Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Initial Position and Movement**:
   - The robot starts at (1, 1).
   - The robot can move left, right, down, or up, but it cannot skip a move.
   - After moving, the robot must follow the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through each column.
   - `reachable_first_row` is set to `True` initially, indicating the robot starts in the first row.
   - `reachable_second_row` is initially `False`.

3. **Detailed Evaluation**:
   - **First Row Processing**:
     - If the arrow is `>` and the robot is in the first row, it can move to the next column in the first row.
     - If the arrow is `<` and the robot is in the first row, it can move to the corresponding position in the second row if that position has a `>` arrow.
   - **Second Row Processing**:
     - If the arrow is `>` and the robot is in the second row, it can move to the next column in the second row.
     - If the arrow is `<` and the robot is in the second row, it remains in the second row and moves left.

### Analysis of the Code:
- **Switching Rows**:
  - The code correctly handles switching from the first row to the second row when encountering a `<` in the first row and a `>` in the second row at the same column.
- **Final Column Check**:
  - The code checks if the robot can reach the last column of the second row by setting `reachable_second_row` to `True` if the robot is in the second row and the last arrow is `>`.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Redundant Check**: The check `if j == n - 1` inside the loop is redundant because the robot can only reach the last column if it has been moving right consistently.
- **Handling `<` in the Second Row**: The code does not handle the case where the robot is in the second row and encounters a `<`. The robot should be able to move left and potentially switch back to the first row if the corresponding position in the first row has a `>` arrow.
- **Initial Movement**: The robot can move down initially without any arrow direction check.

### Revised Correctness:
The original assessment missed the requirement that the robot can move down initially and can switch rows based on the `<` and `>` arrows in both rows. The code does not handle the case where the robot can move left in the second row and switch back to the first row.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program does not correctly handle all possible movements and transitions between rows.

**Final: **False**
