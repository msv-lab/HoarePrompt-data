Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `results` contains `'NO'`, `j` is `n`. If `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged. If `j` does not equal `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.**
