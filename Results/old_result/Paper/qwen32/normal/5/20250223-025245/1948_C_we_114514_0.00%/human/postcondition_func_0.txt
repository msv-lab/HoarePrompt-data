The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing only '<' and '>' characters. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to reach the end of the second string starting from the beginning of the first string, moving only to the right ('>') or switching to the corresponding position in the other string if the current character is '<'. The function returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the end of the second string is reachable.
