The code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. The values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is that `reachable_first_row` is `True` if all elements in `row1` are `'>'`; otherwise, it is `False`. `reachable_second_row` remains `True`, and `results` now contains the string `'YES'`.

Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is `True` if all elements in `row1` are `'>'`; otherwise, it is `False`; `reachable_second_row` is `True`; `results` contains `['YES']`.**
