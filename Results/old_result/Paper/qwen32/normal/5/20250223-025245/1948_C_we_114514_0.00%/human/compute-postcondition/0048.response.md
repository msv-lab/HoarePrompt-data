Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is incremented by 1, `reachable_first_row` is True or False based on previous conditions. If `reachable_second_row` is True and `row2[j]` is '>', and `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` remains True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` retains its previous value. If `reachable_second_row` is False, it retains its previous value.**
