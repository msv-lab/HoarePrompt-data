Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `results` contains `'NO'`, and `j` is `n`. If `reachable_first_row` is `True` and `row2[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `j` equals `n - 1`, otherwise `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`. If `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. If `row2[j] != '>'`, `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.**
