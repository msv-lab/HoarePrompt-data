The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect the variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is `True` if all elements in `row1` are `'>'`; otherwise, it is `False`. `reachable_second_row` is `False`. `results` contains `'NO'`.**
