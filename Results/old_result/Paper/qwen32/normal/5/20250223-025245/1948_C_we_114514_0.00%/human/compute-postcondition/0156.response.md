Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. `j` is `n`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, then `reachable_second_row` remains `True` if `j` equals `n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, or `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, it remains `False`. If `row2[j] != '>'`, `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.**

This postcondition captures all the possible states after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
