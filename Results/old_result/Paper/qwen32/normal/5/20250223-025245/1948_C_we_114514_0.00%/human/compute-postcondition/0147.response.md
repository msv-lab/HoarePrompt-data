Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. `j` is `n`.**
