Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `j` is `j + 2`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`**

In this output state, the value of `reachable_second_row` has been explicitly set to `True` by the code snippet provided. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions as described in the initial state.
