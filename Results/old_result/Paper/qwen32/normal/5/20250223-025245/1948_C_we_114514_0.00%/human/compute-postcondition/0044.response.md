Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is incremented by 1. If `reachable_first_row` is True, then: if `row1[j]` was '>', and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, if `row1[j]` was '>', `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. If `row1[j]` was not '>', `reachable_first_row` is False. If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. If `reachable_first_row` is False, then `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.**
