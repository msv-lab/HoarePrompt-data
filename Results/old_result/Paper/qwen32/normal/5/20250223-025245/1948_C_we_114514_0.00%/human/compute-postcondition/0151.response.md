Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. `j` is `n`. If `row1[j] == '>'`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `j` equals `n - 1`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. If `row1[j] != '>'`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged. `reachable_first_row` is `False` if `row1[j] != '>'`.**
