The code snippet sets `reachable_second_row` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `test_case`, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `False`, and `results` contains `['YES']` if `reachable_second_row` was `True` before this assignment; otherwise, `results` contains `'NO'`.**
