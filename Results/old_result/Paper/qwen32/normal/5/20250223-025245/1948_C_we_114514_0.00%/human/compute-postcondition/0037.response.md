The only object in the loop head is the variable `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`.
- `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `row2[j] == '>'` and `j == n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of the iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1` from the previous state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**

To make it clear that `j` is incremented:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**

Since `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1` again, which means `j` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**

For clarity, if `j` was 3 at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is 4, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**

Generalizing this, if `j` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**

Simplified:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**

Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged.**

Corrected Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>'
