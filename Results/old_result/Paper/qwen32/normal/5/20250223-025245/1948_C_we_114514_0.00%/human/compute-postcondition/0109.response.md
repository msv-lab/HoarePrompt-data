The only object in the loop head is the variable `test_case` from the `test_cases` list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `test_case` for the next iteration of the loop.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `reachable_first_row` is `True` if all elements in `row1` are `'>'`; otherwise, it is `False`. `reachable_second_row` is `True` if any of the conditions mentioned above are met; otherwise, it is `False`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, `results` contains `['YES']`. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `results` contains `'NO'`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_case` must be the next item in the `test_cases` list.

State: **`reachable_first_row` is `True` if all elements in `row1` are `'>'`; otherwise, it is `False`. `reachable_second_row` is `True` if any of the conditions mentioned above are met; otherwise, it is `False`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, `results` contains `['YES']`. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `results` contains `'NO'`. `test_case` is the next item in the `test_cases` list.**
