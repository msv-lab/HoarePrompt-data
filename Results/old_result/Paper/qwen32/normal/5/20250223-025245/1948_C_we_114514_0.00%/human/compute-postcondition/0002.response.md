The code snippet unpacks the first test case from the `test_cases` list into the variables `n` and `(row1, row2)`. Specifically, `n` is assigned the integer value from the test case, and `row1` and `row2` are assigned the two strings of length `n` from the test case. The `results` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters.**
