Let's analyze the given Python program against the problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It stores these values in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes two boolean variables:
     - `reachable_first_row` is set to `True` (since the robot starts at (1, 1)).
     - `reachable_second_row` is set to `False`.
   - The program then iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Logic for Reaching the Second Row:**
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in `row1[j]` points right (`'>'`):
       - If `j` is the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to (2, n).
       - Otherwise, it does nothing, indicating the robot stays in the first row and moves right.
     - If the arrow in `row1[j]` points left (`'<'`):
       - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` because the robot can't stay in the first row.
       - If `j` is not the last column and the arrow in `row2[j]` points right (`'>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to the second row and then right.
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in `row2[j]` points right (`'>'`):
       - If `j` is the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (redundant, but does no harm).
       - Otherwise, it does nothing, indicating the robot stays in the second row and moves right.
     - If the arrow in `row2[j]` points left (`'<'`), it does nothing because the robot stays in the second row and moves left.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all columns for a test case, the program checks if `reachable_second_row` is `True`.
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to `results`.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO' to `results`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the results for all test cases.

**Correctness Analysis:**
- The program correctly handles the movement of the robot according to the rules.
- It correctly sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` if the robot can reach the last column of the second row.
- The logic for handling the arrows and transitions between rows is accurate based on the problem description.

**Conclusion:**
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
