The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified directly, but we can infer that `j` was incremented from its previous value. Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, if the loop just finished an iteration, `j` must have been `n-1` at the end of that iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`, but since the loop condition is `j in range(n)`, `j` should be set to `0` at the start of the loop to begin the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, then if `row2[j]` equals `'>'` and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, the current value of `j` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, the state remains unchanged, `j` is 0**
