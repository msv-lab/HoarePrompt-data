Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case, `results` is a list containing either the string `'YES'` if `reachable_second_row` is True, or the string `'NO'` if `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the tuple which is the second element of the next `test_case`, and `reachable_first_row` is True. If `row1[j]` is `'>'` and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is set to True. If `row1[j]` is `'>'` and `j` is less than `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains False. If `row1[j]` is not `'>'` and `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` equals `'>'`, `reachable_second_row` is set to True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False.**
