The code snippet provided assigns the value `False` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The initial state specifies that `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `reachable_first_row` retain their values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one test case where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) which is even, and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an even integer (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `row1` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `row2` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False.**
