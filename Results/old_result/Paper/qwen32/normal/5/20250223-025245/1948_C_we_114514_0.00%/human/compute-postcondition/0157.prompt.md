Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `False`, and `results` contains `['YES']` if `reachable_second_row` was `True` before this assignment; otherwise, `results` contains `'NO'`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, then if `row2[j]` equals `'>'` and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, the current value of `j` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `j` was `n - 1` before the if statement and `row2[j]` equals `'>'`, then `j` remains `n - 1`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged and `j` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of `test_case`, and `results` contains `'NO'`. `j` is `n`. If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, then `reachable_second_row` remains `True` if `j` equals `n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, or `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`. If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, it remains `False`. If `row2[j] != '>'`, `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
