The provided code snippet reads three integers `u`, `v`, and `f` from the input and assigns them to the respective variables. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `i`, `s`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are new integers read from the input with `k` greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `a` is 0; `i` is 0; `s` is 0; `m` is greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input for each of the `m` iterations**.
