You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).
   - It then reads the details of each pair of friends (a_i, b_i, f_i).

2. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability of selecting any particular pair of children during an excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - This probability is used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion can be derived by considering the contribution of each friend pair.
   - The contribution of a pair with initial friendship value \( f_i \) after \( i \) excursions is \( f_i + i \) (if the pair is chosen in the \( i \)-th excursion).
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values over k excursions can be calculated using the probabilities and the friendship values.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the modulus \( M \) as \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \( \binom{n}{2} \) (which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \)) using the `pow` function. This is used to calculate the probability of selecting any pair.
   - It initializes `s` (sum of expected values) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values).

2. **Reading Friendships:**
   - The program reads the details of each pair of friends and adds their initial friendship values to `a`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value by iterating over the number of excursions (k).
   - The formula used in the loop is incorrect. The program uses \( s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a \), which does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.

### Correctness:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used to update `s` is incorrect and does not account for the correct probabilities and contributions of each friend pair.

### Correct Formula:

The correct expected value for each excursion can be calculated as follows:
- The expected contribution of a pair with initial friendship value \( f_i \) after \( i \) excursions is \( \left( f_i + \frac{i(i+1)}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
- The expected value for all pairs over k excursions can be calculated by summing the expected contributions of all pairs.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used for calculating the expected value.

Correctness: **False**
