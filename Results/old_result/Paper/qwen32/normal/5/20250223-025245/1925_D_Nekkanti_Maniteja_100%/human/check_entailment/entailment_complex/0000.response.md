### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem statement.

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for k randomly chosen pairs of children over multiple test cases. The expected value is given as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

The key steps in the problem are:
1. Calculate the probability of choosing a specific pair of friends.
2. Update the friendship value of chosen pairs.
3. Compute the expected sum of friendship values for k excursions.

The given program does not correctly follow these steps. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Probability Calculation**: The program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9+7\). This is correct as it represents the probability of choosing any specific pair of children.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The program correctly sums up all initial friendship values (`a`).

3. **Expected Sum Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the expected sum (`s`) using the formula:
   \[
   s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
   \]
   This formula is incorrect. The correct expected sum for all excursions should be derived from the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends and the probability of choosing each pair. The correct formula for the expected sum should be:
   \[
   \text{Expected Sum} = a \cdot k + m \cdot \left(\frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}\right) \cdot c
   \]
   where:
   - `a` is the sum of all initial friendship values.
   - `m` is the number of pairs of friends.
   - `k` is the number of excursions.
   - `c` is the probability of choosing any specific pair of children.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The program correctly applies the modulo operation at the end.

### Correct Formula Derivation:
- The expected sum of the initial friendship values over `k` excursions is `a * k`.
- The expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends is `m * (k * (k - 1) / 2) * c` because each pair of friends has a probability `c` of being chosen in each of the `k` excursions, and the sum of the first `k-1` integers is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the expected sum of friendship values. The formula used in the loop is incorrect, and the program does not properly account for the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Answer:
Correctness: **False**
