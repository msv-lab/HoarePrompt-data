Output State: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid + 2`, `rightOne` is 4 if `s[i]` is not '0', else `rightOne` is 2, `trightOne` is 5 if `s[i]` is not '0', else `trightOne` is 4, `rightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', else `rightZero` is unchanged, `trightZero` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0', else `trightZero` is unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the variable `trightOne` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions as described.
