Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing '0's and '1's. It calculates and prints the optimal split point for each test case such that the number of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side of the split point is as balanced as possible.**
