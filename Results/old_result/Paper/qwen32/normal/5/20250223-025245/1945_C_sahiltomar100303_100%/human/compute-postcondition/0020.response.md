Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`. If the current character `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1, `tleftZero` is 1, and all other counters (`rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`) are 0. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, and all other counters (`leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`) are 0.**
