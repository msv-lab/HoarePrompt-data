Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 1; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightOne` is -1; `n` is at least 2; the character at index `right` of the string `s` is not '0'; `tleftOne` is 1.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `trightOne`, which has been decremented by 1, resulting in a value of -1. All other variables retain their initial values as described.
