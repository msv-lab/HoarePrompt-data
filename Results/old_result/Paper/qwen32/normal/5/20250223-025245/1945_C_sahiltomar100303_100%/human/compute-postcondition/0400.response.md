Given the initial state, we have several variables defined, but the key variable we are interested in is `left`. The description states that `left` is not equal to 0, but it does not provide an explicit value for `left`. Therefore, we can only state that `left` has a value that is not 0.

Since no further information about the exact value of `left` is provided, we can't determine a specific numerical value for it. However, we know it is a non-zero value.

Output: **left (where left is a non-zero value)**
