The code snippet `trightZero -= 1` decrements the value of `trightZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `trightZero` is initially 0. After the decrement, `trightZero` becomes -1.

The other variables remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 1; `tleftZero` is 1; `trightOne` is 0; `n` is at least 2; the character at index `right` of the string `s` is '0'; `trightZero` is -1.**
