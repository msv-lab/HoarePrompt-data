Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and `n > 0`, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is one less than its previous value, `rightOne` is one more than its previous value.**

In natural language: The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged with their respective conditions and values.
