Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `leftOne` is incremented by 1, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, all the preconditions remain valid. The variable `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `i`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged from their initial state.
