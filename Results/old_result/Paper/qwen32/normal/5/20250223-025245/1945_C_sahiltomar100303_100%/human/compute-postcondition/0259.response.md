To determine what will be printed by the `print(right)` statement, let's analyze the given initial state:

- `right` is explicitly set to 4.
- `right` is also set to `n`, but `n` is not defined in the initial state. However, the value of `right` is initially set to 4, and there is no subsequent assignment to `right` that would change its value based on `n` in the provided code snippet.

Since `right` is explicitly assigned the value 4, the `print(right)` statement will output this value.

Output: **4**
