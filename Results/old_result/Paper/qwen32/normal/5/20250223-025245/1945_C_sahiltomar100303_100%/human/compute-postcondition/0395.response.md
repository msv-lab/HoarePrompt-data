Given the initial state, we need to determine the value of the variable `left` that will be printed by the `print(left)` statement.

From the initial state provided:
- `left` is explicitly set to 0.

Since there are no operations or changes to the value of `left` mentioned in the initial state or the code snippet, we can directly use the value provided.

Therefore, the output of the `print(left)` statement will be the value of `left`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
