Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0; `s` is the value of the user's input; `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero` remain unchanged; if `right` is not equal to `n`, `right` remains 4; if `right` is equal to `n` and `left` is 0, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2` based on the condition; if `right` equals `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; if `right` does not equal `n` and `left` is not 0, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`; `mid` is `n // 2`.**

In simple terms, the variable `leftZero` has been set to 0. All other conditions and variable states remain the same as described in the initial state.
