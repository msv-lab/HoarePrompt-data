Postcondition: **`left` is either 0 or not 0, `right` is either `n` or less than `n`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of non-'0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` must be less than `n`, `i` is `mid + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 3, and `trightOne` is either 4 or 5. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is 3, `trightOne` is 5, and `rightZero` is either 2 or unchanged.**
