Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `left` is 2, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is -1, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:3]` minus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value of `leftOne` minus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 1 if `s[2]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, plus 1, `rightOne` is less than `(n - 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne`, `leftMove` is 0**.

In natural language: The value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
