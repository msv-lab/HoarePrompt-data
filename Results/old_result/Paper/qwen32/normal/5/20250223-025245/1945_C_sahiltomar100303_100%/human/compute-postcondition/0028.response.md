The code snippet `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `leftZero` is incremented by 1.**
