Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the input integer, `left` is the value of `mid`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `mid` is the same as the initial value, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne`, `leftMove` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the input integer, `left` is 2, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is 0 if `s[2]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 1, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:3]` minus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value of `leftOne` minus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 1 if `s[2]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne`, `leftMove` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the input integer, `left` is 1, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value of `leftOne` minus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 1 if `s[2]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is less than `(n - 1) // 2` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1', otherwise it is less than `(n - 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is -1 and `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is the input integer, `left` is 0, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is 3, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value of `leftOne` minus 1 if `s[2]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `tleftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[3:n]` plus 1 if `s[2]` is '0', otherwise it remains the same, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` and has been incremented by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', `trightZero` is the same as `rightZero`, `trightOne` is the same as `rightOne` plus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1', otherwise it remains the same, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0' and `rightZero` is incremented by 1, otherwise `leftZero` is 0 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1, `leftOne` is the initial value of `leftOne` minus 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
