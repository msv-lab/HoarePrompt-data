Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is -1 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightOne` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 1; `rightZero` is 2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0'; `leftOne` is 0 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0'; `right` is 4 and `right` equals `n`; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightOne` is 1; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightZero` is 1; and `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
