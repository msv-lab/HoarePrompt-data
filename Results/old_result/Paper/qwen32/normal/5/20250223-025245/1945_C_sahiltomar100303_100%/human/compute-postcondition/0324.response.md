Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than `mid`. `mid` remains the same as the initial value. `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0. `s` is the value of the user's input. `leftZero` and `leftOne` are the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]` respectively, and they remain the same. `tleftOne` remains the same as the initial value. `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]` and remains the same. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 5 if the if part is executed, or 4 if the else part is executed. `trightZero` is 2 if the if part is executed, or 1 if the else part is executed. `rightOne` is 0 if the if part is executed, or 1 if the else part is executed. `trightOne` is 0 if the if part is executed, or 2 if the else part is executed. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` is the initial value of `rightOne` plus 1 if the if part is executed, or plus 2 if the else part is executed. `trightOne` is 2 if the if part is executed, or 3 if the else part is executed. `rightZero` is 0 if the if part is executed, or 1 if the else part is executed. `trightZero` is 3 in both cases. `i` is `mid + 2`.**
