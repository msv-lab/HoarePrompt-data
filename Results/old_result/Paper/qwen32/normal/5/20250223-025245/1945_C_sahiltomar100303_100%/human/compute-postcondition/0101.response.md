Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(mid + 3) // 2 + 1`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `trightZero` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
