The code snippet `leftOne -= 1` decrements the value of `leftOne` by 1. Given the initial state, `leftOne` is either -1 or 0 depending on whether the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0' or '0', respectively.

- If the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `leftOne` was -1, and after the decrement, `leftOne` becomes -2.
- If the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', `leftOne` was 0, and after the decrement, `leftOne` becomes -1.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`left` is 1, `leftZero` is -2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is -1, `rightOne` is 3 if the character at 0 of the string `s` is not '0', `rightZero` is 3 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 2, `leftOne` is -2 if the character at index 0 of the string `s` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is -1, `n` is at least 5**.
