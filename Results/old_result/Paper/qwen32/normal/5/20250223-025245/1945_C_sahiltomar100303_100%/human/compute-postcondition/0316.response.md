The code snippet `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than `mid`, `mid` is the same as the initial value, `left` is 0 if the initial condition was `left == 0`, otherwise `left` is not 0, `s` is the value of the user's input, `leftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `leftOne` is the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `tleftOne` is the same as the initial value, `tleftZero` is the number of '0's in the substring `s[0:mid]`, `rightOne` is the initial value of `rightOne` plus 1, `trightOne` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 3, `i` is `mid + 1`.**
