Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 999; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a new list of integers read from the input that must have at least `n` elements; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `value` is `a[n - 1]`; `greater_count` is 0; `same_value_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`.**

In this output state, the variable `greater_count` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
