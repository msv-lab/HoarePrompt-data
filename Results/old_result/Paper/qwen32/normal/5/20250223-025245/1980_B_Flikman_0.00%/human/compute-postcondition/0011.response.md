Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`. If the current `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is 2. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is 1; `value` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The value of `same_value_count` is incremented by 1. If `value` was equal to `favorite_value` before the increment, `same_value_count` becomes 2. If `value` was not equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
