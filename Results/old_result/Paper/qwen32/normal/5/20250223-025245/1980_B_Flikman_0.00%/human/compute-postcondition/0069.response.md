Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` <= 999; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`; `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`; `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`; `greater_count` is less than `k`; and `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`.**
