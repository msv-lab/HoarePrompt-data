Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n * k <= 2 * 10^5. Each of the k lines for a test case contains n distinct integers a_{ij} such that 1 <= a_{ij} <= n, where a_{i0} is the author of the screenshot and is always at the top of the list. It is guaranteed that the sum of n * k for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5 and all the authors of the screenshots are different.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if m == 1:
        input()
        print('yes')
        continue
    a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())
    a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())
    l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]
    l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]
    if l11 != l22:
        for _ in range(m - 2):
            input()
        print('no')
        continue
    idx1 = idx2 = -1
    p1 = p2 = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
            break
        if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
                idx1 = idx2 = i
                break
            else:
                if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                    idx1 = i
                    p1 = 1
                else:
                    idx2 = i
                    p2 = 1
                if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                    break
    val = []
    if idx1 < idx2:
        l2.insert(idx1, a2)
        l = l2
    elif idx1 > idx2:
        l1.insert(idx2, a1)
        l = l1
    else:
        if m == 2:
            print('yes')
            continue
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2):
            l1.insert(idx2, a1)
            l = l1
        else:
            l2.insert(idx1, a2)
            l = l2
        val.append((a3, l3))
        m -= 1
    for _ in range(m - 2):
        a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
        val.append((a3, l3))
    for a3, l3 in val:
        if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
            print('no')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: the loop has completed all iterations without breaking and prints 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is 1, n is the first integer from the input, m is at least 3, a1 is the first integer from the new input, a2 is the first integer from the latest input, l1 is a list of the remaining integers from the new input with a1 inserted at position idx2 if idx1 is greater than idx2, otherwise l1 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding all occurrences of a2, l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input with a2 inserted at position idx1 if idx1 is less than idx2, otherwise l2 is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, l11 is a list containing elements from l1 excluding all occurrences of a2, l22 is a list containing elements from l2 excluding all occurrences of a1, i is n - 2, idx1 and idx2 hold their last updated values, p1 and p2 hold their last updated values, val is a list containing m - 2 tuples (a3, l3).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has executed all `m - 2` iterations without breaking out of the loop, meaning for each tuple `(a3, l3)` in `val`, `l3` is equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed. The program prints 'yes'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
