Output State: **`val` contains at least three tuples, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the third tuple in `val` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `val`, `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that it exits the most internal loop or if statement.
