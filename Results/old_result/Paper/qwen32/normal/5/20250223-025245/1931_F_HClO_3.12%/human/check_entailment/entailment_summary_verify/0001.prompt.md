You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n people in the programming contest chat. Chat participants are
ordered by activity, but each person sees himself at the top of the list.

For example, there are 4 participants in the chat, and their order is [2, 3,
1, 4] . Then

  * 1 -st user sees the order [1, 2, 3, 4] . 
  * 2 -nd user sees the order [2, 3, 1, 4] . 
  * 3 -rd user sees the order [3, 2, 1, 4] . 
  * 4 -th user sees the order [4, 2, 3, 1] . 

k people posted screenshots in the chat, which show the order of participants
shown to this user. The screenshots were taken within a short period of time,
and the order of participants has not changed.

Your task is to determine whether there is a certain order that all
screenshots correspond to.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains two integers n
and k (1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted
screenshots.

The following k lines contain descriptions of screenshots posted by the
participants.

The i -th row contains n integers a_{ij} each (1 \le a_{ij} \le n , all a_{ij}
are different) — the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0} ,
where a_{i0} — the author of the screenshot. You can show that in the
screenshot description it will always be at the top of the list.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot k for all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . It is also guaranteed that all the authors of the screenshots
are different.

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
an answer, output "YES" if there exists at least one order of participants,
under which all k screenshots could have been obtained. Otherwise, output
"NO".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of `n` distinct integers across `k` lines. For each test case, it determines if it's possible to arrange the lists such that, after inserting the author of each screenshot into the appropriate position, all lists (except for the author) are identical. It prints 'yes' if such an arrangement is possible for all test cases, otherwise 'no'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if there exists a single consistent order of participants in the chat that matches all the screenshots taken by different participants. Each screenshot shows the participants in an order where the person who took the screenshot is at the top.

### Program Analysis

The program follows these steps:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `k`.
   - It then reads `k` lines, each representing a screenshot.

2. **Handling Special Case**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program immediately prints "YES" because there is only one screenshot, and it trivially satisfies the condition.

3. **Processing Screenshots**:
   - For `k > 1`, it reads the first two screenshots.
   - It checks if the remaining participants (excluding the person who took the screenshot) in both screenshots are the same. If not, it prints "NO" and moves to the next test case.
   - If the remaining participants are the same, it tries to determine the position where the person who took the second screenshot should be inserted in the first screenshot to make them consistent.
   - It handles cases where the insertion positions for the two screenshots are different by reading an additional screenshot to resolve the ambiguity.

4. **Validation**:
   - After determining a consistent order, it checks if all remaining screenshots match this order (excluding the person who took the screenshot).
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints "NO". If all match, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Evaluation

The program's logic seems to cover the necessary conditions to determine if there is a consistent order of participants that matches all the screenshots. However, there are a few points to consider:

- **Handling of Multiple Screenshots**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1`.
  - For `k > 1`, it correctly checks the consistency of the remaining participants in the first two screenshots.
  - It resolves ambiguity by reading additional screenshots if necessary.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program considers edge cases where the order of participants is reversed or where there are only a few participants.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program reads and processes each screenshot efficiently, ensuring it stays within the time constraints given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all given conditions and edge cases appropriately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
