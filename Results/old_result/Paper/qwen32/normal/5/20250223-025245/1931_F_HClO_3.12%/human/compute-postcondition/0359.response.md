Output State: **`val` contains at least two tuples, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the second tuple in `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `val`, `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
