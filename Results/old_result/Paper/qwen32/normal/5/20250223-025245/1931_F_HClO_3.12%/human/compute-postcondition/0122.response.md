Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines, with `l2` having `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l1` having `a1` inserted at `idx2` if certain conditions are met; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively, reflecting any insertions; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, otherwise `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is a list containing tuples of the form `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line, and `val` has at least one more tuple `(a3, l3)` left to process; `(a3, l3)` is the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with `a3` removed, the loop is broken, and no further changes are made to the variables.**
