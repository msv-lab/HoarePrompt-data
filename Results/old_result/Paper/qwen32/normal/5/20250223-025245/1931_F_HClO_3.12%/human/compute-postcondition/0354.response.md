Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `val` contains at least one tuple.
- `m` is at least 3.
- `a3` and `l3` are the values of the first tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the string `'no'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `val`, `m`, `a3`, and `l3`, and a condition involving `l3` and a list `l`. However, these variables and conditions do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the `print` statement is static and does not reference any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
