Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). The current elements at index `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are not equal, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.**

In this output state, the only variable that has changed is `idx1`, which is now set to the value of `i`, which is `n - 2`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
