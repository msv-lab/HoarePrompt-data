The `break` statement in the provided code will exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it will not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `val`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, and `l` will remain as they were in the initial state. The only change is the program flow due to the `break` statement.

Output State: **`val` contains at least one tuple, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
