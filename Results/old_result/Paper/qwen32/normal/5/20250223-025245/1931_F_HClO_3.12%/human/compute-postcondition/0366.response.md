Output State: **the loop has executed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has either printed 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions specified in the code.**

In natural language: The loop has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it checks if the conditions are met for the lists of authors and their screenshots. If the conditions are satisfied, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The state of variables like `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` are updated according to the logic of the loop for each test case, but the overall output is a series of 'yes' or 'no' responses corresponding to each test case.
