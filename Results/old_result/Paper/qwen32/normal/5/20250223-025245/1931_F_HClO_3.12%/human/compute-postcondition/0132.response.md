The code snippet creates a new list `l11` by filtering out all occurrences of `a2` from the list `l1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged, except for the creation of `l11`.

Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations without breaking and prints 'yes'. `t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, and `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`.**
