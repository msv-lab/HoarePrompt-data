Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is assigned the value of `i` and `p1` is set to 1; if `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx2` is assigned the value of `i` and `p2` is set to 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` >= 0 and `idx2` >= 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
