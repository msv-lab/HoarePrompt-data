Let's break down the given information and analyze the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `val` contains at least two tuples.
- `m` is at least 3.
- `a3` and `l3` are the values of the second tuple in `val`.
- If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('no')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`. The `print` statement is not dependent on any variables or conditions within the provided initial state. The initial state describes the structure and some conditions related to the variables `val`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, and `l`, but these do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'no'` regardless of the values of `val`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, and `l`.

### Final Output:
Output: **no**
