The code snippet provided appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means that the list `val` now includes an additional element which is a tuple consisting of the integer `a3` and the list `l3`.

The other variables (`t`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `l`, `a3`, `l3`, `_`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines, with `l2` having `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l1` having `a1` inserted at `idx2` if certain conditions are met; `l11` and `l22` are lists derived from `l1` and `l2` excluding `a2` and `a1` respectively, reflecting any insertions; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`, otherwise `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l` is the list `l2` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise `l` is the list `l1` if `idx1 > idx2`, or a list with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `_` is incremented by 1; `val` now includes an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`**.
