test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each test case starts with a tuple (n, k) where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is the number of chat participants and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n) is the number of participants who posted screenshots. Following (n, k) are k lists, each of length n, representing the order of participants as seen by each participant who posted a screenshot. Each list contains integers from 1 to n, all of which are unique, and the i-th list's first element is the participant who posted the screenshot. The sum of n · k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
