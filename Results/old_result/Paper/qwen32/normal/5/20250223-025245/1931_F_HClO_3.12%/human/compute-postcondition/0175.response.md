Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p2` is 1, and if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain as per the initial conditions, and no break occurs.**

In simple terms, the value of `p2` has been changed to 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
