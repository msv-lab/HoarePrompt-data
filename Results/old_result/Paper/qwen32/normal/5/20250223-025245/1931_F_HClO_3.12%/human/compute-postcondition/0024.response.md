Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, then `l11` remains not equal to `l22`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0.`**

Natural Language: The variables `p1` and `p2` have been assigned the value 0. All other variables retain their original values and conditions as specified in the initial state.
