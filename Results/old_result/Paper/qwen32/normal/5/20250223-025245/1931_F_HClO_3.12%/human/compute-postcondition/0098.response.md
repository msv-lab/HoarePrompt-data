Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value minus 1; `a1` and `a2` are the first integers from the new input lines; `l1` is the list with `a1` inserted at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l1` and `l2` are lists of the remaining integers from the same lines with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1`; `l2` is unchanged if `idx1 > idx2`; `l11` is derived from the updated `l1` excluding `a2` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l11` is derived from `l1` excluding `a2` and `l22` is derived from `l2` excluding `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or the index where the mismatch involving `a1` and `a2` was found; `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last mismatch involving `a1` and `a2`; `i` is the last index checked before breaking the loop; `val` is an empty list if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from the new input line and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l` is the list `l1` if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list with `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3`, otherwise `l` is equal to `l2`.**
