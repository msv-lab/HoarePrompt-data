The code snippet `idx1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. Given that `i` is 3, `idx1` will also be 3. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is 3, `idx1` is 3. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
