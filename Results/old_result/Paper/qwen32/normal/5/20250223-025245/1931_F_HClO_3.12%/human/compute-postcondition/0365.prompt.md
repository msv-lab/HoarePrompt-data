Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` contains at least one tuple, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` contains at least two tuples, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the second tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` contains at least three tuples, `m` is at least 3, `a3` and `l3` are the values of the third tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
