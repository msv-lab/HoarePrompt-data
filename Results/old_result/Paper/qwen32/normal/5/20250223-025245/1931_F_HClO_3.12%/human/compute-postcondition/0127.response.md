The provided initial state indicates that the loop has completed all iterations without breaking and the `print('yes')` statement will execute. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are mentioned but are not directly used in the `print` statement provided. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

The `print('yes')` statement will simply output the string 'yes'.

Output: **yes**
