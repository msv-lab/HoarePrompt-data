Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; if `l11` is not equal to `l22`, then `l11` remains not equal to `l22`; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0.`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then `p1` and `p2` are updated as follows: if `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, `p1` is set to 0, `p2` is set to 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `p1` is set to 1 and `p2` is set to 0 if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, otherwise `p1` is set to 0 and `p2` is set to 1. If `idx1` >= 0 and `idx2` >= 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1` < 0 or `idx2` < 0, the program does not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no additional changes occur. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `idx2` is set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` >= 0 and `idx2` >= 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no such break occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `m` is an integer that must be at least its original value; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line; `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`; `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`; `l11` is not equal to `l22`; `n` must be at least 2; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is assigned the value of `i` and `p1` is set to 1; if `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx2` is assigned the value of `i` and `p2` is set to 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` >= 0 and `idx2` >= 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
