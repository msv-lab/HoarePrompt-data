The code snippet only initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both to the value `-1`. No other variables are affected, and no calculations or changes are made to the existing variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, or `l22`. The condition regarding `l11` and `l22` does not affect the execution of this specific code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**
