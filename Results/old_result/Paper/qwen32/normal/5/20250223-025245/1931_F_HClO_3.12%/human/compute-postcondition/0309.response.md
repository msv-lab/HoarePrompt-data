The code snippet `idx2 = i` simply assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. Given that `i` is 0, `idx2` will also be 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is 0, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`). If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `idx2` is 0.**
