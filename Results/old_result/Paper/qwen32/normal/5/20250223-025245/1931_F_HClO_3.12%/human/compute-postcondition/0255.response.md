To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `(m - 2)` is greater than 0, meaning `m - 2` must be at least 1. Therefore, `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Given this requirement, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m`. The other variables in the provided state (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`) do not directly influence the execution of this loop.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a1` is the first integer from the latest input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the latest input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` hold their last updated values, `p1` and `p2` hold their last updated values, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples (`a3`, `l3`)**
