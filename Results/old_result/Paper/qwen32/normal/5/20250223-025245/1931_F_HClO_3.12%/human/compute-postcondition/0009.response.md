The code snippet reads a line of input, maps it to integers, and assigns the first integer to `a2` and the rest to `l2`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, and `l1` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. Otherwise, `m` retains its original value. `a1` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line. `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the same line.**
