Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is `num_next`, `cur` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the list `N` and the integer `T` remain the same. The integer `S` is still an input integer, `num` is now equal to `num_next`, and `cur` has been incremented by 1. The program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
