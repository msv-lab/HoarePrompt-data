Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Provided Code Analysis

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        for i in range(cur):
            if M[i] <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        print(cur)
```

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `N` is sorted, which is not necessary for finding the MEX. Sorting can introduce unnecessary complexity.
2. **Tracking Frequencies**: The code uses a dictionary `M` to track the frequency of each number in `N`.
3. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The code iterates through the sorted array and updates `cur` to the current number if it's greater than `cur` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If the number is the same as `cur`, it increments the frequency in `M`.
   - If the number is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks the loop and increments `cur` by 1.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the frequencies equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - Finally, it checks if any number in `M` has a frequency less than or equal to its index. If so, it updates `cur` to that index.

### Potential Issues

1. **Sorting**: Sorting the array is unnecessary and can be inefficient given the constraints.
2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating the MEX seems flawed. The code does not correctly handle the case where the MEX is not the first missing number in the sequence.
   - The code does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the same number and how it affects the MEX.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided example and some additional edge cases.

#### Example Test Case

**Input:**
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
0
```

#### Additional Test Cases

**Test Case 1:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Test Case 2:**
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Expected Output:**
```
0
```

**Test Case 3:**
```
1
5
4 3 2 1 0
```
**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Test Case 4:**
```
1
6
0 1 2 3 4 4
```
**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

### Testing the Program with the Additional Test Cases

Let's run the provided code with these test cases to see if it produces the correct output.

#### Test Case 1:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Expected Output:**
```
5
```
**Actual Output:**
```
5
```
**Result:** Correct

#### Test Case 2:
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Expected Output:**
```
0
```
**Actual Output:**
```
1
```
**Result:** Incorrect

### Conclusion

The program does not handle the case where there are multiple occurrences of the same number correctly. Specifically, it fails to produce the correct MEX when all elements are the same.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The program fails to correctly calculate the MEX in cases where there are multiple occurrences of the same number. The logic for determining the MEX is flawed, and it does not handle all edge cases as expected.
