The code snippet `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, overriding the previous value of `cur`. The initial value of `cur` is dependent on the condition `M[i + 2] <= i + 2`, but this condition is no longer relevant since `cur` is directly set to `i`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `cur` is `i`**.
