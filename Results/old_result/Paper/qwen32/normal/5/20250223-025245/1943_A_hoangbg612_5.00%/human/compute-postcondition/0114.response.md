Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `cur` is -1, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `num` is greater than `cur`. The current value of `cur` is -1, and `num` is greater than 0. Additionally, `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**
