The provided code snippet contains a `break` statement, which will terminate the nearest enclosing loop. However, the variables `i` and `cur` are not affected by this `break` statement; their values remain unchanged. The initial state of `i` is described as `i + 1`, and `cur` is also `i + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `cur` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
