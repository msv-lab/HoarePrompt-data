Output State: **`num` is greater than `cur`, and `cur` is equal to `num`. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is no longer relevant because `num` is not greater than `cur + 1` after the assignment.**

In simpler terms, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and the condition that would have caused a break out of the loop or if statement is no longer applicable.
