Postcondition: **`cur` is `num + 1` if `num` was greater than -1 and `num > cur + 1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains either `num` if `num` was greater than -1 or -1 if `num` was -1. `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 integer, and `M` is a dictionary with the entry `{num: 1}` if `num` is greater than -1, or an empty dictionary if `num` is less than or equal to -1. `num` is the next element in `N` after the previous `num`. If `num > cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
