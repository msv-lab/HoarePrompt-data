Output State: **`cur` is `i`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `cur`, `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain the same as in the initial state, but we exit the loop or if statement we were inside.
