Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and placing them in another array `c`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c` while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Strategy:
1. **Alice's Objective**: To maximize the MEX of `c`, Alice should try to pick numbers such that the smallest missing number in `c` is as large as possible.
2. **Bob's Objective**: To minimize the MEX of `c`, Bob should try to pick numbers such that the smallest missing number in `c` is as small as possible.

### Key Points:
- The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array.
- The game ends when all elements from `a` are picked.
- Both players play optimally.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided program to see if it correctly computes the MEX of `c` when both players play optimally.

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        for i in range(cur):
            if M[i] <= i:
                cur = i
                break
        print(cur)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `T` and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.
2. **Sorting**: The array `N` is sorted.
3. **Tracking MEX**:
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `M` is a dictionary to keep track of the count of each number in `N`.
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it sets `cur` to `cur + 1` and breaks the loop. Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and initializes its count in `M`.
     - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.
4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from `0` to `cur` and checks if the count of any number `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.
5. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `cur`, which is the MEX of `c`.

### Correctness Check:
The provided program does not correctly model the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. The program does not simulate the turns and does not correctly compute the MEX based on the optimal play.

- **Optimal Play Simulation**: The program should simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, taking into account their objectives. Alice should try to maximize the MEX, and Bob should try to minimize it.
- **MEX Calculation**: The program's approach to calculating the MEX is flawed. It does not correctly handle the interaction between the players' choices.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
