To determine what will be printed by the `print(cur)` statement, we need to understand the context provided by the initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`cur`**: This variable is defined as the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] <= i`. If no such `i` is found within the range `[0, cur-1]`, `cur` retains its initial value.
2. **`T`**: This variable remains unchanged and is not relevant to the `cur` variable.
3. **`S`**: This variable remains unchanged and is not relevant to the `cur` variable.
4. **`N`**: This is a sorted list of integers.
5. **`M`**: This is a dictionary where the keys are unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks, and the values are their respective counts.

### Analysis:
- The variable `cur` is the result of a search for the smallest index `i` where the count of `i` in the dictionary `M` (i.e., `M[i]`) is less than or equal to `i`. If no such `i` is found within the range `[0, cur-1]`, `cur` retains its initial value.
- Since the exact value of `cur` before the loop or the specific contents of `N` and `M` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `cur`. However, we can describe the value of `cur` based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The `print(cur)` statement will output the value of `cur` which is the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] <= i` within the range `[0, cur-1]`. If no such `i` is found, `cur` retains its initial value.

Output: **cur (where cur is the smallest index i such that M[i] <= i within the range [0, cur-1], or the initial value of cur if no such i is found)**
