Output State: **`cur` is 0, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of the variables `cur`, `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, and the condition that `num` is greater than `cur + 1` remain unchanged. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
