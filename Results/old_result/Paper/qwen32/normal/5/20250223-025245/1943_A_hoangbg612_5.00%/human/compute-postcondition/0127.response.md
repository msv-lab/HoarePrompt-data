The value of `cur` is updated to the value of `num`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet. Since `num` is specified as being equal to `num_next`, the new value of `cur` is `num_next`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is `num_next`, `cur` is `num_next`.**
