The code `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The variables `N`, `T`, `S`, `num`, and `num_next` remain unchanged. The only change is that the dictionary `M` now has a key `cur` with the value `1`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after `num_next`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is 1.**
