To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop given the initial state and the progression after the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over a sorted list `N` of integers. The variable `cur` starts at -1. The dictionary `M` is initially empty.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `cur = -1`
   - `M = {}`
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `S` is an input integer (not affected by the loop).
   - `T` remains unchanged (not affected by the loop).

2. **First Iteration**:
   - The first element `num` in `N` is processed.
   - If `num > cur` (which is always true since `cur = -1` and `num` is at least the smallest integer in `N`), it checks if `num > cur + 1` (i.e., `num > 0`).
     - If true, `cur` is incremented to 0 and the loop breaks.
     - If false, `cur` is set to `num`, and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
   - If `num <= cur` (which is not possible here since `cur = -1`), `M[cur]` would be incremented by 1.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - For each subsequent `num` in `N`:
     - If `num > cur`, it checks if `num > cur + 1`.
       - If true, `cur` is incremented to `cur + 1` and the loop breaks.
       - If false, `cur` is set to `num`, and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
     - If `num <= cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State

The loop will iterate over all elements in `N` until it finds a `num` such that `num > cur + 1`, at which point it breaks. Otherwise, it will process all elements in `N`.

- **`cur`**: Will be the last `num` processed before the loop breaks, or the last element in `N` if the loop does not break.
- **`M`**: Will contain keys for each unique `num` encountered in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks, with values representing the count of each `num`.
- **`N`**: Remains unchanged as a sorted list of integers.
- **`S`** and **`T`**: Remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

### Conclusion

The final output state is:
- `cur` will be the last element in `N` or the last `num` processed before the loop breaks.
- `M` will be a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts.

### Output State in the Required Format

Output State: **`cur` is the last element in `N` or the last `num` processed before the loop breaks; `T` remains unchanged; `S` remains unchanged; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `cur` will be the last number processed in the list `N` before the loop breaks, and `M` will have counts of all numbers processed up to that point.
