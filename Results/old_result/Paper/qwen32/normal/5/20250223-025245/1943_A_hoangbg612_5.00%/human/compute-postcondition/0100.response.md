The code snippet `cur = i` directly assigns the value of `i` to `cur`, regardless of the previous condition that determined `cur`'s value. Therefore, the new value of `cur` is simply `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is `i`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts, `i` is `i + 1`**.
