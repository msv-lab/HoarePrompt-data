The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Since `cur` is specified to be `num`, the dictionary `M` will have a key `num` with the value `1`.

Given the initial state, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `cur` is `num`. After executing the code, `M` is no longer empty but contains the key `num` with the value `1`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `T` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `M` is a dictionary with the key `num` and the value `1`, `cur` is `num`.**
