In the given for loop, the only variable that can be adjusted in the loop head is `i` and the range is determined by `cur`. To ensure the loop executes, `cur` must be greater than 0 because `range(cur)` will generate values from 0 up to, but not including, `cur`. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function and does not need to be adjusted in the state description.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `cur` is greater than 0.
2. The variable `i` is controlled by the `range(cur)` function and starts at 0, so no specific adjustment is needed for `i` in the state description.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we only need to ensure that `cur` is greater than 0.

State: **`cur` is greater than 0**
