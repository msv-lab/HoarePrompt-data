To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop over multiple test cases. Let's break down the loop's logic and the provided output states for the first three iterations.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `T` is the total number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `S` is an integer, and `N` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `M` is a dictionary to store the count of each unique number in `N`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each number `num` in the sorted list `N`, the code checks if `num` is greater than `cur`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it sets `cur` to `num` and adds `num` to the dictionary `M` with a count of 1.
     - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `num` in `M`.
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - Finally, it finds the smallest `i` such that `M[i] <= i` and updates `cur` to this `i` if such an `i` exists.

3. **Output**:
   - The value of `cur` is printed for each test case.

### Output States:
- **After 1 iteration**: `cur` is the smallest index `i` for which `M[i] <= i`, or the initial value of `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range.
- **After 2 iterations**: Similar to the first iteration but with the range `[0, cur-1]`.
- **After 3 iterations**: Same as above, but the range is `[0, cur-1]`.

### Generalizing to All Iterations:
- For each test case, `cur` is recalculated independently based on the values of `S`, `N`, and the processed elements in `N`.
- The value of `cur` for each test case does not affect the processing of subsequent test cases.
- The loop processes each test case independently, and the final output for each test case is determined solely by the logic within the loop for that test case.

### Final Output State:
The output state after all iterations is a sequence of `cur` values, one for each test case. Each `cur` value is determined by the logic described above for that specific test case.

Output State: **A sequence of `cur` values, one for each test case, where each `cur` is the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] <= i` within the range `[0, cur-1]` for the respective test case.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is a series of numbers, each representing the result of the loop for a specific test case.
