Let's analyze the given information and determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given:
- State at the end of the previous iteration: `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, and `cur` is set to `i`.
- If `M[i]` is greater than `i`, the state remains unchanged from the precondition, and no further action is taken.
- The loop is defined as:
  ```python
  for i in range(cur):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable is `i`, and the range is determined by `cur`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` was set to `i`, meaning the loop will iterate over the range from `0` to `cur-1` in the next iteration.
- Since `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, the state is adjusted such that `cur` is now `i`.

### State Adjustment:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- Since `cur` was set to `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1` for the next iteration, and `cur` should remain `cur`.

### Conclusion:
- The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1, and `cur` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, `cur` is set to `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to strictly adhere to the format and only adjust the objects in the loop head (`i` and `cur`):
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `cur` is `i`**
