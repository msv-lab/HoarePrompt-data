`N` is assigned the value of a list created by splitting the input string and converting each split element to an integer. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
