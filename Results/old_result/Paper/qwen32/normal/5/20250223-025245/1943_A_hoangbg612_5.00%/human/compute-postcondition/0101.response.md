Output State: **`cur` is `i`, `T` remains unchanged, `S` remains unchanged, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks and values as their respective counts, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the variables `cur`, `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement, except that the loop is exited.
