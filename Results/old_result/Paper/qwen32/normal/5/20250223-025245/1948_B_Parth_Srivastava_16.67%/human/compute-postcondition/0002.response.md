The code snippet converts the input string `a` into a list of integers. Therefore, `a` is no longer a string but a list of integers. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of integers; `k` is an input integer.**
