Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is 2 if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `n` is 1; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)` if `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0; `c` is a list containing the integers `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `c` is a list containing `a[i]`; `i` is 0; either `a[i]` is not greater than 10 or `i` is not greater than 0.**
