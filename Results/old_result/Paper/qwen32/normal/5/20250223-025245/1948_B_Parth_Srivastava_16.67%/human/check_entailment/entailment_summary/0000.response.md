### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits. The program reads multiple test cases, processes each array according to the described rules, and outputs "YES" or "NO" based on whether the array can be sorted.

Let's break down the program's logic and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Processing Each Array:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for processing each array.
   - It iterates through each element of the array `a`.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and appends them to the list `c`.
   - The program checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted and appends `1` to the list `b` if it is sorted, otherwise `0`.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - The program uses the `sorted` function to sort the list `c` and compares it with the original list `c` after processing.
   - If `c` is sorted, it means the array can be transformed into a sorted array using the described operations.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates through the list `b` and prints "YES" for each `1` and "NO" for each `0`.

However, there is a flaw in the logic of the provided program:

- The logic for splitting the numbers and appending them to the list `c` is incorrect. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the insertion of the digits into the same position as the original number.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the digits of a number are not in non-decreasing order. For example, if the number is 21, it should split into [2, 1] but the program may not handle this correctly.
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the first element of the array is greater than 10.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned, the program does not correctly implement the described logic for transforming the array and checking if it can be sorted. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
