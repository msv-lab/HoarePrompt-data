Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an integer ranging from 1 to 7 based on the conditions; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10` if `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)` if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, otherwise `y` is 0; `c` is a list that contains either `a[i]` if `y > x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or the integers `y` and `x` if `y <= x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or the integers `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x` and `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, or `c` is a list containing `a[i]` if `i` is 0 or `a[i]` is not greater than 10, or `c` includes `x` as an additional element if `y <= x`. If `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, and `y >= c[n - 1]`, `c` includes `a[i]` as an additional element. If `y <= x`, `c` also includes `y` and `x` as additional elements. If `y < c[n - 1]`, no changes are made to `c`. If `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, `c` also includes `x` as an additional element if `y <= x`. `i` is 2 or greater than 2 and `a[i]` is greater than 10 if the if condition is met, otherwise `i` is 2 or greater than 2 and `a[i]` is greater than 10 or `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10` if the else condition is met.**
