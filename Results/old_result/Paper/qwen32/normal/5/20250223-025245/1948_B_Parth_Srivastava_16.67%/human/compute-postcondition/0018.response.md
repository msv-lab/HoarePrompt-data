Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is 1; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list containing `a[i]`; `i` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10; the integer division `y` of `a[i]` by 10 is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`; and `y` is greater than `x`.**
