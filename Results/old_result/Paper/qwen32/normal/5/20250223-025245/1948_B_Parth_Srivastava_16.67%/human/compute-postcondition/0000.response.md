The code snippet provided is `k = int(input())`, which reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `k`. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a` as they are not referenced or modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99; `k` is an input integer.**
