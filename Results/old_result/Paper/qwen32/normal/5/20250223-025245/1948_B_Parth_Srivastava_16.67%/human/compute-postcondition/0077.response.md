Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an integer between 2 and 7 based on the conditions; `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the integer remainder of `a[i] % 10`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list that includes `a[i]` if `y > x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or `y` and `x` if `y <= x` and `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10`, or `y` and `x` if `y <= x` and `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, or `c` includes `a[i]` if `i` is 0 or `a[i]` is not greater than 10, or `c` includes `x` as an additional element if `y <= x`, and if `y <= x`, `c` also includes `x` as an additional element; `i` is 2 or greater than 2 and `a[i]` is greater than 10.**
