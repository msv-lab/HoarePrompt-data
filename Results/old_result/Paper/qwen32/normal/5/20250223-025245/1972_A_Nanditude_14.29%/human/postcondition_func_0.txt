The function accepts a list `arr` where the first element is the number of test cases `t`, and the subsequent elements are test cases represented as lists starting with an integer `n` followed by two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. It returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order based on the entire sublist, meaning the test case with the highest value sequence appears first.
