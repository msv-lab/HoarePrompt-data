Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of lists representing test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by two lists `a` and `b` of length `n` (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of `arr` is the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The function returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order based on the entire sublist, meaning the test case with the highest value sequence will appear first.**
