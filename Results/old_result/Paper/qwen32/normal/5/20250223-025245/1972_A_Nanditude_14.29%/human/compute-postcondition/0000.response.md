Output State: **The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. The first element of `arr` is the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent element is a test case represented as a list starting with an integer `n`, followed by two lists `a` and `b` of length `n`. The sorting is done in reverse order, meaning the test case with the highest value (considering the entire sublist as a sequence) will appear first.**

In simpler terms, the program sorts the list `arr` in reverse order, so the largest sublists come first, and the smallest come last.
