The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
