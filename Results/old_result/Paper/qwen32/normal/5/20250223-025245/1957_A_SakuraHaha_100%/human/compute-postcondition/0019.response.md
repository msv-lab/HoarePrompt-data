Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, where 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the lengths of the sticks, where each length satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given stick lengths.**
