You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and the list of stick lengths a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is a list of integers where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is 0; `cnt` is a dictionary where the count of each unique integer in `a` is stored.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is the sum of `x // 3` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`, `cnt` is a dictionary where the count of each unique integer in `a` is stored.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of x // 3 for all x in cnt.values())
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. It calculates the total number of complete sets of three sticks that can be formed from the list, where each set consists of sticks of the same length, and prints this count.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks. Specifically, it always divides the count of each stick length by 3 to determine how many polygons can be formed, which is incorrect. 

To form a regular polygon, the number of sides (sticks of the same length) must be at least 3. However, the program does not check if the count of sticks is at least 3 before dividing by 3. Additionally, the program does not consider polygons with more than 3 sides. 

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- We can form one square using four sticks of length 3.

However, the program will output `1` because it divides the count of sticks of length 3 (which is 4) by 3, resulting in 1. This is correct for this specific case, but it does not generalize.

Now consider another test case:

Input:
```
1
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
- We can form one pentagon using five sticks of length 2.
- We can form one square using four sticks of length 4.

However, the program will output `1` because it only considers forming triangles (dividing by 3) and does not account for polygons with more sides.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
