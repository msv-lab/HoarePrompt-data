The code snippet `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1` updates the dictionary `cnt` by incrementing the count of the key `x`. If `x` is not already in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `ans` remains 0.

Given that `x` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the change to `cnt` in terms of `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` is the integer input provided, where 1 <= `n` <= 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer; `ans` is 0; `cnt` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is incremented by 1**.
