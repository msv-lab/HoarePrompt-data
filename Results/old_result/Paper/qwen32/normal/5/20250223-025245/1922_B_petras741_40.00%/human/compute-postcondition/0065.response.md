The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 2, and `n` must remain greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 2, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` which is 1, `j` is 2**
