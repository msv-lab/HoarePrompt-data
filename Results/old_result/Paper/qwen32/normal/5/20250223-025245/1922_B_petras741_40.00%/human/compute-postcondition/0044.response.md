Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[0]]`, `q[w[1]]`, `q[w[2]]`, ..., `q[w[n-1]]` which are incremented by 1 respectively, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from `0` to `n` where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta` and `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is `1 + 2 * q[eta[j]]`, `res` is updated to `res + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
