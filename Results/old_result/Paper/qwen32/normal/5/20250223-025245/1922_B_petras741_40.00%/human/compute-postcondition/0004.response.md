The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `w`. The variables `t`, `i`, and `buffer` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `n` is mentioned as an input integer, but it is not used in the provided code snippet, so it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
