The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given the initial state, `j` is 4. Therefore, the list `eta` will now contain the value 4.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`, and `j` is 4; `eta` is [4].**
