The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w` and `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w` and `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`.**
