The code snippet `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Given the initial state, `j` is 3, so `eta` will now contain the value 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in the list `w`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list, `j` is 3, `eta` is [3]**
