The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the element of the list `q` at the index specified by `w[j]` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, meaning `q` looks like `[0, 0, ..., 0]` with `n + 1` elements. The list `w` is a list of integers, and `j` is an index into `w`. 

After the code executes, the value at `q[w[j]]` will be 1 (since it was 0 and is incremented by 1). All other elements of `q` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers converted from the new input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `q[w[j]]` which is 1**.
