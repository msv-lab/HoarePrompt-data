The code snippet `q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]` creates a list `q` with `n + 1` elements, all of which are `0`. This means that `q` is now a list of `n + 1` zeros. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**.
