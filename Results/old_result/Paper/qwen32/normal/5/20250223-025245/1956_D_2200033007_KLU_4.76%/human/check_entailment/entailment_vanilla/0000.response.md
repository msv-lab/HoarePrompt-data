Reasoning:

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program's output is hardcoded based on the length of the array (`c`), ignoring the actual values in the array. Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input but does not convert the array elements to integers. Instead, it keeps them as strings.
2. **Logic Implementation**: The program only handles two cases: when the length of the array is 2 and when it is not 2. It does not implement any logic to calculate the MEX or to maximize the sum of the array based on the problem's requirements.
3. **Output**: The output is hardcoded. For an array of length 2, it outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, and for any other length, it outputs `13 0`. This does not reflect the actual maximum sum or the operations needed to achieve it.

The program does not take into account the values in the array, the MEX calculation, or the operations required to maximize the sum. Therefore, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
