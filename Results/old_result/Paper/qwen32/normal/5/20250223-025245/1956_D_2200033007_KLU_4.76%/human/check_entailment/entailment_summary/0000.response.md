Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all given input cases. The function `func_1` makes incorrect assumptions about the input and provides hardcoded outputs that do not correspond to the actual solution based on the input array. Specifically:

1. The program does not process the input array `a` to determine the MEX values and perform the operations as described in the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` checks if the length of the array `c` is equal to 2 and prints "4 1" followed by "1 2", which is only correct for the specific case where the input array is [0, 1]. However, this is not a general solution.
3. For all other cases, the function prints "13 0", which is only correct for the input array [1, 3, 9] but incorrect for other arrays.

The program does not implement any logic to compute the MEX, perform the operations, or calculate the maximum sum of the array, which is the core task of the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
