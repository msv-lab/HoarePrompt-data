### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the function summary in the context of the problem description.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- We are given an array of integers and can perform operations to maximize the sum of the array.
- An operation allows us to choose a subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements in that subarray to the MEX.
- The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

**Code Analysis:**
- The code reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of integers.
- It then calls `func_1(len(a))`, which takes the length of the array `a` as an argument.
- `func_1` checks if the length of the array is 2 and prints "4 1" followed by "1 2" if true. Otherwise, it prints "13 0".

**Function Summary:**
- The function `func_1` does not perform any operations on the array to maximize the sum.
- It simply checks the length of the array and prints predefined outputs.

**Original Assessment:**
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.
- The function `func_1` does not handle all potential cases and specifically does not handle cases where the length of the array is not 2.
- The program does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array and does not correctly handle inputs other than an array of length 2.

**Examples:**
- For the input `3 1 3 9`, the program should output `13 0` because the initial sum is already the maximum possible sum without any operations.
- For the input `4 1 100 2 1`, the program should output `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4` to maximize the sum.
- The program incorrectly outputs `13 0` for both cases, which is not always correct.

**Conclusion:**
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. It fails to perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array and does not handle all potential cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
