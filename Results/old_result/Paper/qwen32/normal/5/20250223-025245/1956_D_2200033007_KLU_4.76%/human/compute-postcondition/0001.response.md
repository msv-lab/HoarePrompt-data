Postcondition: **`c` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(c) ≤ 18 and 0 ≤ c[i] ≤ 10^7 for each i in the range of the length of c; `m` is 0. The current value of `c` is equal to 2.**

Note: The condition `if (c == 2):` seems to imply that `c` is being compared to an integer value (2), but given the precondition, `c` is a list of integers. This condition would always be `False` as a list cannot be equal to an integer. However, following the task instructions, I've included the condition as stated in the if condition.
