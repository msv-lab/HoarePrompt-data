Reasoning: 

The given program is not correctly solving the problem as described. The function `func_1` does not take into account the actual input array and its values, but instead relies on a condition that checks if the length of the array `c` is equal to 2, which is not the correct logic to solve the problem.

The problem requires finding the MEX of subarrays and updating the subarrays to this MEX value to maximize the sum of the array. The program provided does not perform this operation and instead outputs hardcoded results based on the length of the array, which is incorrect.

For example:
- For an input array of length 2, it outputs "4 1\n1 2", which is only correct if the input array is [0, 1]. For other possible inputs, this is not correct.
- For arrays of length other than 2, it always outputs "13 0", which is not correct for all possible inputs.

The program should be implementing a strategy to calculate the MEX for different subarrays and update them accordingly to maximize the sum. Since the given program does not do this, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
