The code snippet recalculates the value of `t2` as the absolute difference between the `j`-th last elements of the lists `a` and `c`.

Given:
- `t2` was originally calculated as `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.
- `j` is either 1 or 2 based on the initial comparison between `t1` and `t2`.

Since the code snippet recalculates `t2` in the same manner as it was initially defined, the value of `t2` will be the same unless there is a change in the lists `a` or `c` or the value of `j`. However, none of these have changed in the provided code snippet. Thus, `t2` retains its previously calculated value.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `2 * max(t1, t2)`; `k` is len(a); `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is either 1 or 2.**
