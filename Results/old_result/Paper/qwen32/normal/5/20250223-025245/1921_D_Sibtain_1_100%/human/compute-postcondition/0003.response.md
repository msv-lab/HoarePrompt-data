The code snippet `c = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components based on whitespace, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `c`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
