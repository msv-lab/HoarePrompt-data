The value of `t1` is assigned the absolute difference between the first element of the sorted list `a` and the first element of the list `c` sorted in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`.**
