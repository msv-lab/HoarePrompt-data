The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. Given that the provided code snippet is just `continue`, it does not affect the values of any variables. It only influences the flow of the loop in which it is placed, but since no loop is shown in the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration; `i` is a value between 0 and len(a) - 1; `j` is a value between 1 and len(a); `k` is len(a) - 1. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the conditions described above hold. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
