The code snippet initializes three variables: `i`, `j`, and `ans` with the values 0, 1, and 0, respectively. This does not affect any of the previously defined variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0.**
