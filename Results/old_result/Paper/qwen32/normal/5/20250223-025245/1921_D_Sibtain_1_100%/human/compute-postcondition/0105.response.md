Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`; `k` is len(a) - 1; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` remains 2; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 (so if `i` was 0, `i` is now 1, and if `i` was 1, `i` is now 2).**
