The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop for the current iteration only. It does not change any of the variables or the state of the program except for the flow of the loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated in each iteration; `k` is len(a) - 1; `i` and `j` are values based on the comparisons made during the loop.**
