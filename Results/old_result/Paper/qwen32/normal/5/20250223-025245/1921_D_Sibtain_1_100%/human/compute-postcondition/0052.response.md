Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `k` is len(a) - 1. If `len(a) == 1`, no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**

In this output state, the values of `i` and `j` have been explicitly set to 0 and 1, respectively, and `ans` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition.
