The code snippet assigns the value of `abs(a[i] - c[i])` to `t1`. Given the initial state, `i` is either 0 or 1 based on the comparison between `t2` and `t1`. Since the value of `i` is known, `t1` will be the absolute difference between the `i`-th elements of the lists `a` and `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2`; `i` is 0 if `t2` > `t1` else 1; `j` is 2 if `t2` > `t1` else 1; `k` is incremented by 1; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`.**
