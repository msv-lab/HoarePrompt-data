Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with a length of 1, meaning `a` contains only one element.
- `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- There is a condition that if all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied. However, this condition does not affect the calculation in the print statement.
- The current length of `a` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a[0]`**: Since `a` is a list with a length of 1, `a[0]` is the single element in the list `a`.
2. **Understanding `max(c)` and `min(c)`**: Since `c` is sorted in descending order, `max(c)` is the first element of `c` (because it's the largest), and `min(c)` is the last element of `c` (because it's the smallest).
3. **Calculating the Differences**:
   - `abs(a[0] - max(c))`: The absolute difference between the single element in `a` and the maximum element in `c`.
   - `abs(a[0] - min(c))`: The absolute difference between the single element in `a` and the minimum element in `c`.
4. **Finding the Maximum Difference**: The `max` function will return the larger of the two absolute differences calculated above.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the larger of the two absolute differences: the difference between the single element in `a` and the maximum element in `c`, or the difference between the single element in `a` and the minimum element in `c`.

### Output:
Output: **max(abs(a[0] - c[0]), abs(a[0] - c[-1])) (where a[0] is the single element in list a, c[0] is the first element in the sorted list c, and c[-1] is the last element in the sorted list c)**
