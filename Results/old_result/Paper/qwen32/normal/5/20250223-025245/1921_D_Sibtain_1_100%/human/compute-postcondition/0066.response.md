The code snippet increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`; `k` is 1; `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, `j` is 1 and `i` is 2.**
