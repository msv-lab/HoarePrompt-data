Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration; `i` is a value between 0 and len(a) - 1; `j` is a value between 1 and len(a); `k` is len(a) - 1. If `len(a) == 1`, no additional changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to the variables.**
