To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how `ans` is calculated.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
- `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration.
- `k` is `len(a) - 1`.
- `i` and `j` are the final indices after all iterations.

### Key Points:
- `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences `max(t1, t2)` calculated in each iteration.
- `t1` and `t2` are values derived from the lists `a` and `c` respectively during each iteration.
- The exact values of `t1` and `t2` depend on the indices `i` and `j` which are determined by the logic of the iterations.

### Calculation of `ans`:
Since the exact logic for how `i` and `j` are updated in each iteration is not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the sum of the maximum differences `max(t1, t2)` calculated during the iterations.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum differences `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration.

Given the information, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans` without the specific values of `a` and `c` and the logic for updating `i` and `j`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum differences max(t1, t2) for each iteration)**
