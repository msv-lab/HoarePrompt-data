The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Based on the initial state, if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` was initially 2, and if `t2` is not greater than `t1`, then `j` was initially 1. After the increment, `j` will be 3 if it was initially 2, or `j` will be 2 if it was initially 1.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`; `k` is len(a) - 1; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; `j` is either 2 or 3 depending on the initial value of `j`.**
