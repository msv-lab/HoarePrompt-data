Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`; `k` is len(a) - 1; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]);` if `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `t2` is recalculated as the absolute difference between the `j`-th last element of `a` and the `j`-th last element of `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
