Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input, sorted in descending order; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `ans` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`; and `t2` is greater than `t1`.**

In natural language: The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so `j` is now 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
