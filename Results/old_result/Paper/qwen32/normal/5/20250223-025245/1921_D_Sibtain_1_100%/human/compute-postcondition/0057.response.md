The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Given the initial state, `j` was initially 1, so after the execution, `j` becomes 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order; `ans` is 0; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `k` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`; and `t2` is greater than `t1`.**
