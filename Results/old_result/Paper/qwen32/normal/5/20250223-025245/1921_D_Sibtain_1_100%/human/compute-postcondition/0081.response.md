The given code snippet updates the list `c` by reading a new list of integers from the input and converting them to integers. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences calculated in each iteration; `k` is len(a) - 1; `i` and `j` are values based on the comparisons made during the loop.**
