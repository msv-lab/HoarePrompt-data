In the provided for loop, the loop head contains the variable `_` and the function `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the state such that `int(input())` returns a value greater than 0. Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body (as indicated by the comment `# the loop body is omit`), we do not need to adjust its state.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be provided to the `input()` function, ensuring that it represents a positive integer `t`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, which means `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0**.
