The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`. This means the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated based on the input provided. The other variables `t` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is `0`. Otherwise, `k` is `min(n, b - a)`. The input value for the range is decremented by 1 to allow one more iteration.**
