The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates and prints the total cost of purchasing all `n` buns, considering that the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b-k+1` (where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b-a`), and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
