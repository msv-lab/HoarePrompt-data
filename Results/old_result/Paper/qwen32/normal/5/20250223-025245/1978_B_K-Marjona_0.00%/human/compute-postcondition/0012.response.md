Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State and Variables:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `k` is defined as `min(n, b - a)`.

### Code Explanation:
The print statement is:
```python
print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

Let's break this down step-by-step:
1. **Calculate `k`:**
   - `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This means `k` will be:
     - `n` if `n <= b - a`
     - `b - a` if `b - a < n`

2. **Calculate `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`:**
   - This part calculates the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
   - The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` is used to calculate the sum of the series.
   - This simplifies to the sum of `k` terms starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.

3. **Calculate `(n - k) * a`:**
   - This part calculates the sum of `a` repeated `n - k` times.

4. **Add the two results:**
   - The final result is the sum of the two calculated values.

### Output Description:
Given the above steps, the print statement will output the result of the expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`.

- **If `n <= b - a`:**
  - `k = n`
  - The expression simplifies to the sum of the first `n` terms of the series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus `a` repeated `0` times.

- **If `b - a < n`:**
  - `k = b - a`
  - The expression simplifies to the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, plus `a` repeated `n - (b - a)` times.

### Final Output:
Output: **(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a (where k is min(n, b - a))**
