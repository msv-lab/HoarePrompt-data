### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it aligns with the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determine `k`:**
   - The value of `k` is determined as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - This choice of `k` ensures that we do not attempt to sell more buns at a decreasing price than the number of buns available (`n`), and we do not attempt to sell buns at a price less than `a` (since `b - k + 1` should not go below `a`).

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`. Thus, the profit is `n * a`.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated as:
     - The sum of the first `k` buns sold at decreasing prices from `b` to `b-k+1`. This sum can be computed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) * k / 2`.
     - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

Let's verify the program with the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit = `(5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) * 1 / 2 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 3 * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - Output: `17`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
   - Profit = `(9 + (9 - 4 + 1)) * 4 / 2 + (5 - 4) * 5 = (9 + 6) * 4 / 2 + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35`
   - Output: `35`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
   - Profit = `10 * 10 = 100`
   - Output: `100`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit = `(11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) * 5 / 2 = (11 + 7) * 5 / 2 = 45`
   - Output: `45`

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000`

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit = `1000000000 * 1000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000`

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit = `(1000 + (1000 - 999 + 1)) * 999 / 2 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = (1000 + 2) * 999 / 2 + 1 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500`

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case based on the logic described.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
