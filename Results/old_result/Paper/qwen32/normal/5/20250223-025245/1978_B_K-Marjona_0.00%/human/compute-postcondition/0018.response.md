To determine what will be printed, we need to break down the expression and understand the values of each component based on the given initial state.

Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement, it's provided for context).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are new integers read from the input.
- `k` is `min(n, b - a)`.

The print statement is:
```python
print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

Let's break down the expression step-by-step:

1. **Calculate `k`**:
   - `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Calculate `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2`**:
   - This part of the expression calculates the average of `b` and `(b - k + 1)`, then takes the integer division by 2.
   - This can be understood as the average of the last `k` numbers in the range from `b - k + 1` to `b`.

3. **Calculate `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`**:
   - This multiplies the average calculated in the previous step by `k`.

4. **Calculate `(n - k) * a`**:
   - This multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by `a`.

5. **Sum the results of the two multiplications**:
   - The final expression is the sum of the two products calculated above.

Putting it all together, the expression `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a` can be understood as follows:
- The first part, `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`, calculates the sum of the last `k` numbers in the range from `b - k + 1` to `b`.
- The second part, `(n - k) * a`, calculates the sum of `a` repeated `n - k` times.

Thus, the final output is the sum of these two parts.

Output: **(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a (where k = min(n, b - a))**
