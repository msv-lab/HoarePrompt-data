The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This overwrites the previous values of `n`, `a`, and `b` with the new input values. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are the new integers read from the input; `k` is `min(n, b - a)`**.
