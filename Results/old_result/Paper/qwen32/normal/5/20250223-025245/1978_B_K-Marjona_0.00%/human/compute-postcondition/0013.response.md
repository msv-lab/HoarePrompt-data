Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers read from the input; `k` is `min(n, b - a)`. Regardless of whether `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged.**

This postcondition captures that the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` do not change after the execution of the if-else block, irrespective of the condition `b <= a`.
