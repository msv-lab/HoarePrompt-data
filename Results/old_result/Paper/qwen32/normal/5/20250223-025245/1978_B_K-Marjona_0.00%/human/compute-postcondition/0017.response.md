To determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a * n)`, let's break down the given initial state and the code:

- `t` is greater than 0: This condition indicates that some loop or process might be running `t` times, but it does not directly affect the current print statement.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are new integers read from the input: This means `n`, `a`, and `b` are specific integer values provided as input to the program.
- `k` is `min(n, b - a)`: This defines `k` as the minimum value between `n` and the difference between `b` and `a`. However, `k` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a * n)
```

This statement multiplies the integer `a` by the integer `n` and prints the result. Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the output in terms of the variables.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are the integers read from the input)**
