To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic step by step and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob wants to maximize his profit by selling `n` buns. He can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) such that:
- The first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
- The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

The goal is to find the maximum profit Bob can achieve.

### Program Analysis:
The program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` and then calculates the maximum profit as follows:
1. It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
2. If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so it sells all buns at the usual price `a` and prints `a * n`.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`:
   - The sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and ending at `b - k + 1` is `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two amounts.

### Correctness Check:
Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided test cases:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
   - Profit: `(5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) // 2 * 1 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
   - Output: `17` (Correct)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `(9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 35 + 0 = 35`
   - Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
   - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
   - Profit: Since `b <= a`, it's `10 * 10 = 100`
   - Output: `100` (Correct)

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
   - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
   - Profit: `(11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 + (5 - 5) * 5 = 45 + 0 = 45`
   - Output: `45` (Correct)

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: Since `b <= a`, it's `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

6. **Sixth Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 1000000000`, `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
   - Profit: Since `b <= a`, it's `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

7. **Seventh Test Case:**
   - Input: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
   - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
   - Profit: `(1000 + (1000 - 999 + 1)) // 2 * 999 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 500500 + 1 = 500500`
   - Output: `500500` (Correct)

The program correctly calculates the maximum profit for all the provided test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
