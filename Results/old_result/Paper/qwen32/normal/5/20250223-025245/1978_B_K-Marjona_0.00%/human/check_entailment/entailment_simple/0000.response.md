### Reasoning:

The logic of the program can be broken down into the following steps for each test case:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Determine `k`**: It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This is because the number of buns that can be sold at the modified price is limited by either the total number of buns `n` or the number of buns that can be sold at a price higher than the usual price `a` (which is `b - a`).
3. **Calculate Profit**:
    - If `b <= a`, it means selling the first `k` buns at the modified price would not be beneficial since the modified price is not higher than the usual price. Therefore, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`, resulting in a profit of `a * n`.
    - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit by summing the profits from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`. The sum of the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k\). The remaining buns are sold at the usual price, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.

Let's verify the program with the given examples:

- **First Test Case**: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as \((5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) // 2 * 1 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17\).
- **Second Test Case**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 5`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as \((9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 = 35\).
- **Third Test Case**: `n = 10`, `a = 10`, `b = 5`
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is `10 * 10 = 100`.
- **Fourth Test Case**: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as \((11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 = 45\).
- **Fifth Test Case**: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 10^9`
  - `k = min(10^9, 10^9 - 10^9) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`.
- **Sixth Test Case**: `n = 10^9`, `a = 10^9`, `b = 1`
  - `k = min(10^9, 1 - 10^9) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is `10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18`.
- **Seventh Test Case**: `n = 1000`, `a = 1`, `b = 1000`
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as \((1000 + (1000 - 999 + 1)) // 2 * 999 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 500500\).

The program correctly computes the maximum profit for each test case based on the given logic.
