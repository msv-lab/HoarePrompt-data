Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. The function returns the number of times the sequence of coins changes from "U" to "D" or from "D" to "U" for each test case.**
