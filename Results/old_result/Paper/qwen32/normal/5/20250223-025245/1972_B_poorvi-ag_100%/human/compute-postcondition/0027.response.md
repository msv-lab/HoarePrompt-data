The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable that iterates over the elements of the `results` list. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and the requirement for the loop to execute again.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, which are either 'yes' or 'no'.
- The loop variable `i` has just taken on the value of the second element in the `results` list during the previous iteration.

Since the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next element in the list after the current one. If `results` contains at least two elements, after the first iteration, `i` would have taken the value of the first element. Therefore, at the start of the second iteration, `i` should be the second element.

However, since we are asked to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, and we know that the loop has just completed an iteration where `i` was the second element, the next element `i` should take is the third element, assuming `results` has at least three elements.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least three elements, which are either 'yes' or 'no'**
