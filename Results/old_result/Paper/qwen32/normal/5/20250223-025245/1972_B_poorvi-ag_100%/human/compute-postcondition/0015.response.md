Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is odd, `results` is `['yes', 'yes']` if `arr.count('U') % 2 == 1`, otherwise `results` is `['yes', 'no']`. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is even, `results` is `['no', 'yes']` if `arr.count('U') % 2 == 1`, otherwise `results` is `['no', 'no']`.**

To simplify the description based on the if-else block:
