The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `results`. Given that `results` is a list containing at least one element, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements. After the first iteration, `i` would have taken the first element of `results`, so for the loop to execute again, `i` should now take the second element.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least two elements, which are either 'yes' or 'no'**
