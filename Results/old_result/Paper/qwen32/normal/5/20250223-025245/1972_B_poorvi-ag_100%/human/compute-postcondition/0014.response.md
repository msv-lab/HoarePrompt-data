Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", `arr` is the new input string, If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is odd, `results` is `['yes', 'no']`. If the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is even, `results` is `['no', 'no']`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 1, `n` retains its value as the new input integer, `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D", and `arr` retains its value as the new input string. The `results` list is updated to include an additional 'no', making it `['yes', 'no']` if the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is odd, or `['no', 'no']` if the count of 'U' in the original `arr` is even.
