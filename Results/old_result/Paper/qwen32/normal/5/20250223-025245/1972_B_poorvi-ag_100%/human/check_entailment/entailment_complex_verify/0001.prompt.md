You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' in the respective input string is odd or even.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing all the elements that have been processed, with each element being either 'yes' or 'no', representing whether the count of 'U' in the respective input string is odd or even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a string of "U" and "D" characters representing coins facing up or down. It determines if the number of "U" characters in each string is odd and returns "yes" for odd counts and "no" for even counts.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The game revolves around the number of facing-up coins ('U') and how they are distributed. The key insight is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner if both players play optimally.

1. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win. Here's why:
   - Every move reduces the number of facing-up coins by 1 (the chosen coin is removed and the adjacent coins are flipped, but the net effect is one less facing-up coin).
   - Since Alice starts and the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always be the one to make the last move (since the number of moves will also be odd).
   - When there is only one facing-up coin left, the player whose turn it is will remove it and win, as the opponent will not have a move left.

2. If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win. Here's why:
   - Similar to the previous point, every move reduces the number of facing-up coins by 1.
   - Since the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always be the one to make the last move (since the number of moves will be even).
   - Therefore, Bob will be the one to remove the last facing-up coin and win, as Alice will not have a move left.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of 'U's in the input string and checking if it is odd or even. If it is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list, indicating Alice's win; if it is even, it appends 'no', indicating Bob's win.
