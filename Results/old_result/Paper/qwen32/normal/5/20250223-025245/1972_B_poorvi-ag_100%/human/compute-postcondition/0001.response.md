Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code.
