To determine the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the termination condition of the loop and how the variables `low` and `high` evolve. The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`. Therefore, the loop terminates when `low` and `high` are consecutive integers.

Given the nature of the binary search, the loop will continue to narrow down the range `[low, high)` until it can't be split further, meaning `low` and `high` will be adjacent. The value of `mid` is always the integer division of `(low + high) // 2`, and `mid` is added to the set `st` in each iteration. The values of `low` and `high` are adjusted based on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `k`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the final state:
1. The loop terminates when `low` and `high` are consecutive integers.
2. The set `st` contains all the `mid` values that were calculated during the iterations.
3. The values of `low` and `high` will be such that `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`, and `high` is the index of the smallest element in `arr` that is greater than `k`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` remains -1. If `k` is found, `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr`.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final state can be described as follows:
- `low` will be the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k` (or the position where `k` would be inserted to maintain sorted order if `k` is not found).
- `high` will be `low + 1`.
- `st` will be a set containing all the `mid` values that were calculated during the iterations.
- `pos` will be the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.

Output State: **`low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is `low + 1`, `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the iterations, and `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
