### Reasoning:

The provided code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here's an in-depth analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and returns a map object of integers.
   - `func_2` converts this map object into a list.
   - `func_3` uses these functions to read the number of elements `n` and the target value `k`, and then reads the permutation list `arr`.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The code performs a binary search on the permutation list `arr` to find the position of `k` or the largest element less than or equal to `k`.
   - If `k` is found at `arr[low]`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `k` is not found at `arr[low]`, it prints `1` followed by the indices of the largest element less than or equal to `k` and `k` itself if `k` is found in the list.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The code does not implement the logic to perform the swapping operations to make `p_l` equal to `x` after the binary search.
   - The binary search alone is not sufficient to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after the search. The problem specifies that up to 2 swaps can be performed to achieve this.

### Issues:
- The code does not handle the case where `k` is not found in the list and additional swaps are needed to ensure `p_l` equals `x`.
- The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the provided code does not implement this logic.
- The output format and the number of swaps are not correctly handled in all cases as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The code does not fully implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
