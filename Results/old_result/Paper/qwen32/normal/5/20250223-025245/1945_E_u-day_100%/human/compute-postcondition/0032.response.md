Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2`, `mid` (added in this step), `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `high` is at least `low + 2`.**

Explanation: The only change in the state is that `mid` is added to the set `st`, making `st` now contain both `n // 2` and `mid`. All other variables maintain their initial state.
