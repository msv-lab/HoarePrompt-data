The `while` loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the condition must be true. Therefore, we need to adjust the values of `low` and `high` such that `low + 1 < high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively
- `mid` is `n // 2`
- `st` is a set containing `n // 2`
- `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`
- `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k` in the else case

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `low + 1 < high`. Given that `low` and `high` are either `0` and `n // 2` or `n // 2` and `n`, we need to ensure that the difference between `high` and `low` is at least 2.

Let's consider the two cases:
1. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `low` is `0` and `high` is `n // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `0 + 1 < n // 2` must be true, which means `n // 2` must be at least 2, so `n` must be at least 4.
2. If `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n // 2 + 1 < n` must be true, which is always true as long as `n` is greater than 2.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure `n` is at least 4. This ensures that in both cases, the condition `low + 1 < high` is satisfied.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 4.

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `mid` is `n // 2`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` and `high` are adjusted such that `low + 1 < high`**
