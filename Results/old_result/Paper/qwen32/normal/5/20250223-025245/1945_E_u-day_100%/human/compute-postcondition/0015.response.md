The code snippet provided is:
```python
st = set()
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `st` to a new empty set. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `pos`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set, and `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
