Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1, `low` is now `mid`, `high` is adjusted such that `low + 1 < high`**

Natural language explanation: The value of `low` has been updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged with their previous conditions still valid.
