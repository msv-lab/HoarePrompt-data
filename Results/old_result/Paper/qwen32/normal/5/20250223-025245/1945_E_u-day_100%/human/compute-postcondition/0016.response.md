The `while` loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. To ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed, we need to adjust the values of `low` and `high` such that `low + 1 < high` holds true.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n`.
- `st` is an empty set.
- `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.

We need to check the condition `low + 1 < high`:
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n`.

For the loop to execute, `0 + 1 < n` must be true, which simplifies to `1 < n`.

Since we are given that `n` is greater than 0, the only condition we need to ensure is that `n` is indeed greater than 1. If `n` is 1, then `1 < 1` is false, and the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 1.

No other variables in the loop condition (`low` and `high`) need to be adjusted since `low` is fixed at 0 and `high` is `n`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set, and `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**
