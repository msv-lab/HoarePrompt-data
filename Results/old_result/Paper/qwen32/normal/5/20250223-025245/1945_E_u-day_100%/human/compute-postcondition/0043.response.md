Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation. `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`. `pos` is an integer representing the index of the element `k` in `arr`. `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range with initial values `low = 0` and `high = n`. `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process. The function performs a binary search to find a specific condition related to the element `k` in the permutation `arr` and returns a value based on this search.**
