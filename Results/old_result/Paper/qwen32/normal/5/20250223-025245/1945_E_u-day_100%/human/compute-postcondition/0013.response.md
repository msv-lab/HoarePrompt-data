Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is a set used to store the mid values during the binary search process, and `pos` is set to the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all `n` iterations, the variable `pos` will hold the index of the value `k` in the list `arr` if `k` exists in `arr`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` will remain -1. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `low`, `high`, and `st` remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not modified within the loop.
