The provided code snippet contains a simple `print(1)` statement. The initial state describes several variables (`low`, `high`, `st`, `pos`, and elements of `arr`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the integer `1`.

Here is the detailed explanation:

- `low` is the index of the largest element in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `high` is `low + 1`.
- `st` is a set containing all the `mid` values calculated during the iterations.
- `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is found; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print(1)` statement. The statement will simply print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
