Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input. If `a < b < c`, the condition is true and no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Otherwise, the condition `b > a` and `b > c` is evaluated, but `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged regardless of the evaluation result.**
