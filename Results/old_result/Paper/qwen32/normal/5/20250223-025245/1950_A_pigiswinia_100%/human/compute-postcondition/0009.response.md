Given the initial state provided, let's analyze the code snippet and the context:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input.
- It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- It is not the case that `a < b > c`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('NONE')
```

The `print` statement explicitly outputs the string `'NONE'`. The conditions and variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it directly prints the string `'NONE'` without referencing any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NONE**
