The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state provides some conditions about the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the content of the `print` statement. The `print` statement does not reference any of these variables; it directly outputs the string `'PEAK'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is stated to be greater than 0.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
3. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, with the condition that it is not the case that `a < b < c`, and `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

Despite these conditions, the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
