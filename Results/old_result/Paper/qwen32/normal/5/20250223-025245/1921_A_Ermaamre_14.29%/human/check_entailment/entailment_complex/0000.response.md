### Reasoning:
The given program is designed to compute the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the four corners of the square and calculates the side length of the square by identifying two pairs of equal x-coordinates or y-coordinates and then computing the absolute difference in the corresponding y-coordinates or x-coordinates. The area is then calculated as the square of the side length.

Let's break down the logic of the program:
1. **Reading Input:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the coordinates of the four corners for each test case.
2. **Identifying Pairs of Equal Coordinates:** The program checks for pairs of equal x-coordinates or y-coordinates to determine the side length of the square.
3. **Calculating Side Length:** Based on the identified pairs, the program calculates the side length as the absolute difference in the y-coordinates or x-coordinates.
4. **Calculating and Printing Area:** The program squares the side length to get the area of the square and prints it.

The logic in the program correctly handles the given problem constraints and guarantees. The program assumes that the input points always form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, which is consistent with the problem statement.

### Example Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  1 2
  4 5
  1 5
  4 2
  ```
- Calculation:
  - Pairs of equal x-coordinates: (1, 1) and (4, 4)
  - Side length: abs(5 - 2) = 3
  - Area: 3^2 = 9
- Output: `9`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  -1 1
  1 -1
  1 1
  -1 -1
  ```
- Calculation:
  - Pairs of equal x-coordinates: (-1, -1) and (1, 1)
  - Side length: abs(1 - (-1)) = 2
  - Area: 2^2 = 4
- Output: `4`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  45 11
  45 39
  17 11
  17 39
  ```
- Calculation:
  - Pairs of equal x-coordinates: (45, 45) and (17, 17)
  - Side length: abs(39 - 11) = 28
  - Area: 28^2 = 784
- Output: `784`

The program produces the correct output for the provided example, which further confirms its correctness.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to compute the area of a square given its corner coordinates. It handles the input correctly and produces the expected output for the given examples.
