Postcondition: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1` are the input integers, `x2`, `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3`, `y3` are the newly input integers, `x4`, `y4` are the newly input integers, and if `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.**
