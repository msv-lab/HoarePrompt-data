Postcondition: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are the input integers. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y3 - y1)`. Otherwise, if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`. If `x1 != x2` or `x3 != x4`, and `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`. In all other cases, `res` is not defined.**
