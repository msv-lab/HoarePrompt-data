Postcondition: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not adjusted, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` retain their input values. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, if `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1` is less than `y2`; otherwise, `res` is `y1 - y2`.**

This postcondition summarizes the different outcomes based on the conditions in the if and else parts of the code, ensuring that the values of all variables are correctly described after the execution of the if-else block.
