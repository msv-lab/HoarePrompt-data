Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all possible configurations of the square's corners correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that the corners are aligned in a way that makes it easy to determine the side length by comparing x-coordinates directly. However, the corners can be given in any random order, and the program does not account for all possible permutations of the corners.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 2
2 1
1 3
3 1
```
In this case, the square has a side length of 2, and the area should be 4. However, the program will not correctly identify the side length because it relies on specific x-coordinate comparisons that do not hold in this configuration.

A correct approach would involve determining the side length by calculating the distances between all pairs of points and identifying the two unique distances (side length and diagonal length). The side length can then be used to calculate the area.
