Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1` and `y1` are the input integers, `x2` and `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3` and `y3` are the newly input integers, `x4` and `y4` are the newly input integers, `res` is `abs(y1 - y3)`**.

The value of `res` is now the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. All other variables retain their initial states.
