To determine what will be printed by the `print(res ** 2)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the conditions under which `res` is defined and its value based on the given initial state.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Condition 1**: If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is `abs(y3 - y1)`.
2. **Condition 2**: If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then:
   - If `y1 < y2`, `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
   - Otherwise, `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`.
3. **Condition 3**: If `x1 != x2` or `x3 != x4`, and `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
4. **Otherwise**: `res` is not defined.

Given the `print(res ** 2)` statement, we need to determine the value of `res` based on the conditions and then square it.

Let's consider the possible values of `res`:

- If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, `res` is `abs(y3 - y1)`, so `res ** 2` is `(abs(y3 - y1)) ** 2`.
- If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, so `res ** 2` is `(abs(y2 - y1)) ** 2`.
- If `x1 != x2` or `x3 != x4`, and `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, `res` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, so `res ** 2` is `(abs(y2 - y1)) ** 2`.
- If none of the above conditions are met, `res` is not defined, and the code would raise an error.

Since the exact values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions.

Output: **(abs(y3 - y1)) ** 2 if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4, otherwise (abs(y2 - y1)) ** 2 if x1 == x2 and x3 == x4 or x1 != x2 or x3 != x4 and x1 == x4 and x3 == x2, otherwise res is not defined and an error will occur**.
