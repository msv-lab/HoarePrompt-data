The code snippet assigns the values of two newly input integers to `x4` and `y4`. The initial state indicates that `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `x3`, `y3` are already defined integers. The variable `res` is not defined initially. After executing the provided code, the values of `x4` and `y4` will be set based on the new input.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1` are the input integers, `x2`, `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3`, `y3` are the newly input integers, `x4`, `y4` are the newly input integers, `res` is not defined.**
