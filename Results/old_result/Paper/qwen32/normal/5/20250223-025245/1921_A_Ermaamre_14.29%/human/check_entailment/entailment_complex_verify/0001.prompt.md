- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

    #State: The loop has executed `a` times, where `a` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the coordinates of the corners of a square are read, and the side length of the square is calculated as the absolute difference in the y-coordinates if two pairs of x-coordinates are equal, or in the x-coordinates if two pairs of y-coordinates are equal. The area of the square, which is the side length squared, is then printed. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res` are updated with the values from each test case during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates and prints the area of the square.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to calculate the area of a square given its four corners, with the sides of the square being parallel to the coordinate axes.

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads four lines of input, each representing the coordinates of one corner of the square. The program then calculates the side length of the square and computes the area by squaring the side length.

Let's analyze the logic of the program:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
3. It then checks different possible pairings of x-coordinates to determine which two pairs of corners share the same x-coordinate, indicating they are vertical edges of the square.
4. Once it identifies the vertical edges, it calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of these corners.
5. The program then calculates the area by squaring the side length.

However, there is a logical flaw in the code. The program only checks three possible pairings of x-coordinates but does not handle all possible configurations of the corners. Specifically, if the first corner does not match the third or fourth corner in x-coordinates, the program does not correctly identify the vertical edges in all cases.

For example, if the corners are given in the order (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4) where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) form one pair of vertical edges, and (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) form the other pair, the program may not correctly identify these pairs, especially if the first corner does not match either the third or fourth corner in x-coordinates.

To handle all cases correctly, the program should sort the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and then determine the side length based on the differences in the x or y coordinates of the sorted values.
