Postcondition: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are the input integers. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.**
