### Reasoning:

The given Python program reads multiple test cases where each test case consists of four points representing the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The program calculates the side length of the square by checking pairs of x-coordinates and y-coordinates, and then computes the area by squaring the side length.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The first line of input is read to get the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, the program reads four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.

2. **Determining Side Length:**
   - The program checks which pairs of x-coordinates are equal and calculates the side length based on the difference in the corresponding y-coordinates.
   - If no pairs of x-coordinates are equal, it checks which pairs of y-coordinates are equal and calculates the side length based on the difference in the corresponding x-coordinates.

3. **Calculating Area:**
   - The area of the square is calculated by squaring the side length.

4. **Output:**
   - The area is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Verification:

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided example:

**Input:**
```
3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
4
784
```

**Program Execution:**

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Points: (1, 2), (4, 5), (1, 5), (4, 2)
   - The side length is calculated as the absolute difference between y-coordinates of (1, 2) and (1, 5), which is `|5 - 2| = 3`.
   - Area: `3^2 = 9`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Points: (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, -1)
   - The side length is calculated as the absolute difference between x-coordinates of (-1, 1) and (1, 1), which is `|1 - (-1)| = 2`.
   - Area: `2^2 = 4`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Points: (45, 11), (45, 39), (17, 11), (17, 39)
   - The side length is calculated as the absolute difference between y-coordinates of (45, 11) and (45, 39), which is `|39 - 11| = 28`.
   - Area: `28^2 = 784`

The program correctly computes the areas for all test cases as expected.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly calculates the area of the square for each test case based on the provided coordinates.

**Correctness: **True**
