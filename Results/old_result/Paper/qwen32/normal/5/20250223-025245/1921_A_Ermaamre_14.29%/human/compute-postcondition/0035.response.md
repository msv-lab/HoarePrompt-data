The code calculates the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y4` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1` and `y1` are the input integers, `x2` and `y2` are the newly input integers, `x3` and `y3` are the newly input integers, `x4` and `y4` are the newly input integers, `res` is `abs(y3 - y1)`**.
