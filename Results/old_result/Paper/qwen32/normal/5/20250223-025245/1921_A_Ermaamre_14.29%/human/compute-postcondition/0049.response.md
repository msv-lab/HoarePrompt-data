The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x1` and `y1`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged. The variable `res` is not defined or modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `x1`, `y1` are the input integers, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are the input integers, `res` is not defined.**
