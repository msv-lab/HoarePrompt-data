### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the provided program. The program simply calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string and prints this difference. However, this approach does not minimize the penalty as required by the problem statement.

The optimal strategy to minimize the penalty involves splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of the absolute values of the sums of these subarrays, each multiplied by their lengths, is minimized. This is not achieved by simply computing the difference between the counts of `+` and `-`.

Here is a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The goal is to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
   - The penalty for a subarray is `|sum(subarray)| * len(subarray)`.
   - The optimal strategy involves creating subarrays where the sum is zero, or as close to zero as possible, to minimize the penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program reads the input and counts the number of `+` and `-` characters.
   - It then calculates the difference `P - M` and prints it.
   - This difference does not represent the minimum penalty; it simply reflects the net count of `+` over `-` or vice versa.

3. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program does not implement the correct strategy for minimizing the penalty.
   - Correct minimization involves more complex logic, such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach, to determine the optimal subarray splits.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct strategy for minimizing the penalty.

**Final: False**
