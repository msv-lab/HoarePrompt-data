The code snippet provided is `M += 1`, which increments the value of `M` by 1. None of the other variables (`e`, `i`, `s`, `q`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain the same.

Output State: **`e` is a string with at least one character, `i` is `i` + len(new `e`), `s` is an input integer, `q` is the next character in `e`, `M` is incremented by 1.**
