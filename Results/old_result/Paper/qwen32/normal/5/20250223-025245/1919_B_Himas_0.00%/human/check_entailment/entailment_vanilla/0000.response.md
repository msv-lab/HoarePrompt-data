Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty for splitting a given string `s` into non-empty subarrays, where each subarray's penalty is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

### Key Points
1. **Array Conversion**: The string `s` is converted to an array `a` where each '+' is 1 and each '-' is -1.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray `c` is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.
3. **Optimal Splitting**: The task is to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.

### Program Analysis
Let's look at the provided program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = int(input())
        e = input()
        P = 0
        M = 0
        for q in e:
            if q == '+':
                P += 1
            else:
                M += 1
        print(P - M)
```

### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the length of the string `s` as an integer and assigns it to `s`, but `s` is later used as a string. This part is incorrect and should be fixed.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Penalty Calculation**:
    - The program counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and calculates the difference `P - M`.
    - This difference does not represent the minimum penalty. It simply gives the net count of '+' over '-' or vice versa, which is not related to the optimal splitting and penalty calculation as described in the problem.
3. **No Splitting Logic**: The program does not implement any logic to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. It only counts characters and prints their difference.

### Correctness
Given the analysis above, the provided program is incorrect. It does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
