The code attempts to assign the result of `int(input())` to the variable `s`. However, the initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'. This assignment will overwrite the string `s` with an integer value, which is the result of converting the input to an integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer.**
