The value of `P` is set to 0. The values of `M`, `i`, `s`, and `e` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `P` is 0, `M` is the number of non-'+' characters in the new `e`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is the new input string.

Output State: **`P` is 0, `M` is the number of non-'+' characters in the new `e`, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is the new input string.**
