Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 2; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `position` is the position of the last monster processed; `health` is the health of the last monster processed; `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster processed; `time_available` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster processed; `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster processed; `success` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions; `total_bullets_used` is `bullets_needed`; `position` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `time_available` is the absolute value of the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_needed` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`; `i` is 0; `success` remains True unless `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, in which case `success` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions; `total_bullets_used` is `bullets_needed` + `bullets_needed`; `position` is the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the second element of the second tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`; `time_available` is the absolute value of the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_needed` is the second element of the second tuple in `monsters`; `i` is 1; if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `success` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 2; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an input integer; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions; `total_bullets_used` is `3 * bullets_needed`; `position` is the first element of the third tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the second element of the third tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of the first element of the third tuple in `monsters`; `time_available` is the absolute value of the first element of the third tuple in `monsters`; `bullets_needed` is the second element of the third tuple in `monsters`; `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
