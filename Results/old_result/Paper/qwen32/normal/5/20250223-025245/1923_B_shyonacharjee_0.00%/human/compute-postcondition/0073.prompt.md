Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the input; `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True; `position` and `health` are from the last monster in `monsters`; `distance` and `time_available` are the absolute value of the last position; `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `total_bullets_used` is equal to `bullets_needed`, `position` is the position of the first monster in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the first monster in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the first monster, `i` is 0, `success` is True unless the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` is met, in which case `success` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `total_bullets_used` is `2 * bullets_needed`, `position` is the position of the second monster in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the second monster in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the second monster, `i` is 1, and `success` is False if `2 * bullets_needed > time_available`, otherwise `success` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `total_bullets_used` is `3 * bullets_needed`, `position` is the position of the third monster in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the third monster in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the third monster, `i` is 2, and `success` is False if `3 * bullets_needed > time_available`, otherwise `success` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
