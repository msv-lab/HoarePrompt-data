Postcondition: **`t` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an integer; `healths` is a list of integers; `positions` is a list of integers; `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `position` is the position from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the health from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`; `time_available` is `abs(position)`; `bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `success` remains True.**
