Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `healths` is a list of integers, `positions` is a list of integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `total_bullets_used` is equal to `bullets_needed`, `position` is the position of the second monster in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the second monster in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the second monster, `i` is 1, and `success` is False if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available`, otherwise `success` remains True.**
