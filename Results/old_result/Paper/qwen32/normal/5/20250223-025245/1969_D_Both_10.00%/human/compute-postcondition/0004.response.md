Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`.**

Explanation: The value of `sub_summ` is updated to be the sum of its previous value (`val_a[0]`) and `val_a[0]` again, effectively doubling the first element of `val_a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
