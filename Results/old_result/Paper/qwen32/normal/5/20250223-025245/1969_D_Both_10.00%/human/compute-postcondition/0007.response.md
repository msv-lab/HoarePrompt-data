Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sub_summ` will hold the sum of the first elements of every tuple in `sec_arr`. The state of `main_ar` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
