The function accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers. It calculates a sum, `sub_summ`, by adding the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and then adding the sum of the two integers in each tuple of `main_ar` only if that sum is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns the final calculated sum, `sub_summ`.
