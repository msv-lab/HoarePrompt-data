The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `val_b`, which iterates over `main_ar`. The execution of the loop depends on the contents of `main_ar`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `main_ar` must contain at least one tuple.

The state of `sec_arr` and `sub_summ` are not directly involved in the execution of this specific `for` loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the above, the state should be adjusted so that `main_ar` contains at least one tuple.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`**
