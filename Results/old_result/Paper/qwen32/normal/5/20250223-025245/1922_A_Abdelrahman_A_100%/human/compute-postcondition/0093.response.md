The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. This string is explicitly given in the code and does not depend on any variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
- The string `'YES'` is a literal and does not change based on the values of any variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `tests`, `slength`, `counter`, `i`, `x`, `no`).

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
