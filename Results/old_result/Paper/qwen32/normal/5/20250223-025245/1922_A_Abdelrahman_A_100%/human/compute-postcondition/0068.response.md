Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is greater than or equal to 1, `slength` is the input integer, `counter` is `n`, `i` is the value from the previous iteration plus 1. If `no` is `True`, then the program executes the if part; otherwise, there is no else part to execute.**
