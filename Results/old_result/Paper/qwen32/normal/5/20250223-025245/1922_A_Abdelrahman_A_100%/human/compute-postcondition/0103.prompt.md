Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        counter = 0
        for x in c:
            if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                no = False
                print('YES')
                break
            counter += 1
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the input string consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is greater than or equal to 1, `slength` is an input integer. If `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `no` is True and `counter` is n. Otherwise, the state of `no` and `counter` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is greater than or equal to 1, `slength` is the input integer, `counter` is `n`, `i` is the value from the previous iteration plus 1. If `no` is `True`, then the program executes the if part; otherwise, there is no else part to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the newly input string, `b` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the newly input string, `tests` is greater than or equal to 1, `slength` is the newly input integer, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration's value. If `no` is True, then `counter` is equal to the length of the string `c`. Otherwise, `no` remains False and `counter` retains its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
