You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    tests = int(input())

        a = input()

        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
  - Both strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
  - String `c` does not match the template `t`.
- The template `t` can have lowercase or uppercase letters.
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is lowercase, the `i-th` character of the string must match.
- If the `i-th` character of `t` is uppercase, the `i-th` character of the string must not match the lowercase version of the `i-th` character of `t`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If so, it immediately prints "NO" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, there can't be a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

3. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The program initializes a boolean `no` to `True`. This variable seems to be used to determine if a valid template exists.
   - It then iterates over each character in `c` using a counter `counter`.
   - For each character `x` in `c`, the program checks if `x` is not in the corresponding characters of `a` and `b` (`a[counter]` and `b[counter]`).
   - If `x` is not in both `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`, it sets `no` to `False` and prints "YES", indicating that a valid template exists.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a character, it prints "NO".

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Logic Error in Template Matching:**
  - The current logic incorrectly checks if `x` (a character from `c`) is not in `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`. This is incorrect because we need to create a template `t` that can match `a` and `b` but not `c`. The correct approach would be to check if `a[counter]` and `b[counter]` are the same and `c[counter]` is different.
  - If `a[counter] == b[counter]` and `c[counter] != a[counter]`, then we can create a template where `t[counter]` is the uppercase version of `a[counter]` (or `b[counter]`), which would match `a` and `b` but not `c`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the logic for template matching, the current program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
