Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters, `tests` is greater than or equal to 1, `slength` is the input integer, `no` is False, `counter` is 0, `i` is the value from the previous iteration plus 1, and `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
