Given the initial state, let's analyze the provided `print` statement.

The initial state describes various variables and their properties, but the `print` statement is straightforward:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `tests`, `slength`, `counter`, `i`, `no`, or `x` because it directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
