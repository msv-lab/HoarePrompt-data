The only variable in the loop head is `x` from the string `c`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust `x` to the next character in `c`.

Given that `c` is a non-empty string and the loop iterates over each character in `c`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the next character in the sequence.

Let's denote the current value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration as `c[j]`. At the start of the next iteration, `x` should be `c[j+1]`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `j` or the length of `c`, we can only express the state in terms of the next character in `c`. We also need to ensure that `j+1` is within the bounds of the string `c`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the newly input string, `b` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a non-empty string, `tests` is greater than or equal to 1, `slength` is the newly input integer, `counter` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration's value, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration's value, `x` is the next character in `c`**
