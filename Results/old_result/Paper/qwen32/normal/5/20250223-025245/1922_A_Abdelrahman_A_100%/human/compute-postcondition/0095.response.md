Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is the newly input string, `b` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a non-empty string, `tests` is greater than or equal to 1, `slength` is the newly input integer, `counter` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration's value, `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration's value, `x` is the next character in `c` (i.e., `c[i+1]`). If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
