The provided code snippet contains a single `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes various variables and their properties, but none of them are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
