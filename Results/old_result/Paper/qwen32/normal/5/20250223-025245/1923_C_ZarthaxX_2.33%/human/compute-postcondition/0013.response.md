Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `i` is `n + 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of 1s up to each index in the `nums` list, and the `sum` list will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` minus the number of elements considered so far. The variable `i` will be equal to `n + 1` since the loop runs from 1 to `n` inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
