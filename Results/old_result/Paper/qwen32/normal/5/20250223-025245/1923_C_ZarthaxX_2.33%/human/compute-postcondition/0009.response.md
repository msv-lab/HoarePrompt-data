The code snippet provided updates the `sum` list at index `i` based on the value of `nums[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially `n`, the code will update `sum[n]` to be `sum[n - 1] + nums[n - 1] - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an input integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element `c_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `c_i` ≤ 10^9; For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` and `ones[n]` is updated to `ones[n - 1] + (1 if nums[n - 1] == 1 else 0)`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `sum[n]` is updated to `sum[n - 1] + nums[n - 1] - 1`; `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sum[n]` is now `sum[n - 1] + nums[n - 1] - 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
