Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the situation:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer between 1 and 3 · 10^5.
- `q` is an input integer between 1 and 3 · 10^5.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9.
- For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]`.
- `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
- `i` is set to `n + 1`.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` ≤ `n`.
- `l` equals `r`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or data structures defined in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:
Output: **NO**
