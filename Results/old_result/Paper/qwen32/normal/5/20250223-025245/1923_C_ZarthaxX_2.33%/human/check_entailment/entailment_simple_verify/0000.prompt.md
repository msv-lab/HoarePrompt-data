You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining whether a subarray is "good" is flawed. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Handling Single Element Subarrays**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where `l == r` by printing "NO" because a single element subarray cannot satisfy the condition `a_i != b_i` for every index `i`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The code calculates `sum` as `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`. This is incorrect because it subtracts 1 from each element of the subarray, which is not what the problem requires. The problem only requires that `b_i > 0` for every index `i` and that `b_i != a_i`.

3. **Logic for Determining if the Subarray is Good**:
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is not correct and does not properly check if there exists a valid `b` array that satisfies the conditions.
   - The code does not ensure that `b_i != a_i` for every index `i` and that `b_i > 0`.

### Example to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1
2 2 2
1 3
```
- Expected Output: `NO`
  - The subarray is `[2, 2, 2]`. To be "good", there must exist a `b` array such that `sum(b) = 6` and `b_i != 2` for every index `i`. However, any `b` array that satisfies `sum(b) = 6` will have at least one element equal to 2 (since all elements of `b` must be greater than 0 and different from 2).

The provided code will output `YES` for this input, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The code is not correctly determining whether a subarray is "good" according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is `False`.
