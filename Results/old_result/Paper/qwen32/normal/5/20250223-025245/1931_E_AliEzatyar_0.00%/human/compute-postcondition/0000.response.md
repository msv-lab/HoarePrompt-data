The provided Python code snippet only initializes a variable `counter` to 0. No other variables or data structures are modified or accessed. The initial state describes `num` as a list of test cases, but this list is not used or altered by the given code. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `counter` variable with a value of 0.

Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by t pairs of lists. Each pair consists of a list with two integers [n, m] (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6) and a list of n integers [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `counter` is 0.**
