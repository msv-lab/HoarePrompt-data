The code `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2. Given that `m` was initially 1, after executing this line, `m` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is a non-zero integer that has been updated to `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` was updated.**
