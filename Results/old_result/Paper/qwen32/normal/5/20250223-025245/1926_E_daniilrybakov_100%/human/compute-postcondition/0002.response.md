The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an input integer within a specific range, but `t` is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
