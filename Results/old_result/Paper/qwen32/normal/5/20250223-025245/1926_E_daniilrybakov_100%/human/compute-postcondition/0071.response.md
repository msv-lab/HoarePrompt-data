The code `n //= 2` divides the value of `n` by 2 and takes the floor of the result, meaning it performs integer division. This changes the value of `n` while all other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `n` must be greater than 1, after the operation, `n` will still be greater than 1 if the original `n` was greater than 2. If the original `n` was 2, `n` will become 1 after the operation, but since the precondition states `n` must be greater than 1, we consider `n` to be greater than 2 for the output state.

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, `_`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 1 (specifically, `n` is the floor of its original value divided by 2); `k` is the second input integer; `s` is `s + x`; `m` is 2; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
