The value of `n` is halved using integer division. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is a non-zero integer and is now `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` before `n` was updated.
