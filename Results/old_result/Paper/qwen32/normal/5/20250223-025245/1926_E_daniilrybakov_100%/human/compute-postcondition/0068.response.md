The code snippet `m *= 2` means the variable `m` is multiplied by 2. Given that the initial state specifies `m` is 1, after the operation, `m` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second input integer; `s` is `s + x`; `m` is 2; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
