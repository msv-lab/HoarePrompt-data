The value of `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` must be a non-zero integer; `k` is the second input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
