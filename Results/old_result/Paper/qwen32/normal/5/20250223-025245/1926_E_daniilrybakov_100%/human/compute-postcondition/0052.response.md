Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x + (n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.**
