The code snippet `x = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `x` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `x` was initially defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, reassigning it to the same expression does not change its value. Therefore, the value of `x` remains the same.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, `_`) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is the second input integer; `s` is `s + x`; `m` is 2; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
