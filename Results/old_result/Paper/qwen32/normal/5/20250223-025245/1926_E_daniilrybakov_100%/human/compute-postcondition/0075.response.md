The code snippet `m *= 2` doubles the value of `m`. Given that `m` was initially 2, after executing the code, `m` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 1 (specifically, `n` is the floor of its original value divided by 2); `k` is the second input integer; `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 4; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
