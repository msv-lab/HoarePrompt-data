The variable `m` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `s` is 0; `m` is 1**.
