The code snippet `m *= 2` multiplies the variable `m` by 2. Given that the initial state specifies `m` is 4, after this operation, `m` becomes 8. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `_`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second input integer; `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 8; `_` is 1; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
