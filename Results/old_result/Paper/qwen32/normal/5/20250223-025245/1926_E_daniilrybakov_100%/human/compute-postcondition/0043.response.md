The value of `n` is updated to be `n // 2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is now `(n // 2)`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is now `(n // 2)`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x`; `m` is 2; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**
