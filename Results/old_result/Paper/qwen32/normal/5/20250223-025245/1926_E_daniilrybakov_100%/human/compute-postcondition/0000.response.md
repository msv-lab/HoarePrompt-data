Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value obtained from the input. The constraints for `t`, `n`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state.
