The value of `n` is updated to be `n // 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 5 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `x + (n + 1) // 2`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

In natural language: The value of `n` is now half of its original value (integer division). The values of `t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state.
