The value of `n` is halved (integer division). The other variables remain unchanged unless `n` was previously defined in a way that affects `x` or `s`. Since `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` and `s` is `2*x`, both `x` and `s` will be recalculated based on the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n` is now `n // 2`; `k` is an input integer; `s` is `2*((n // 2) + 1) // 2`; `m` is 4; `x` is `((n // 2) + 1) // 2`. If `x < k` and `k <= 2*x`, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain as described. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.**
