Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is an input string. If the number of occurrences of '1' in `a` (denoted as `count`) is 0, then `count` remains 0. Otherwise, if `count` is greater than 2 and even, then `count > 2` and `count % 2 == 0`. If `count` is exactly 2, then the condition `a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1'` holds unless the first '1' is at the last position of the string or the character immediately following the first '1' is also '1'. Otherwise, `count` is not equal to 2, and either `count` is less than or equal to 2, or `count` is not an even number.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the user input string, `i` is 1, and `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition checks if the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not followed by another '1', but the state of the variables remains unchanged regardless of whether the if condition is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new user input string, `i` is 2, and `count` is the number of '1's in the new string `a`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `count` remain unchanged regardless of the execution of the if or else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
