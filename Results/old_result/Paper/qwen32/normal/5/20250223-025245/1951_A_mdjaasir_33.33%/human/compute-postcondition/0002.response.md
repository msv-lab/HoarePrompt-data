Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the variables `start` and `end` retain their initial properties, and `t` is still required to be greater than 0. The new variable `n` is assigned the value of an integer input.
