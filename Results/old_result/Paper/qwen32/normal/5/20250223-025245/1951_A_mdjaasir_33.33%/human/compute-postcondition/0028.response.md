In the given initial state, several variables and their relationships are described, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('YES')`. This statement is a simple print operation that outputs the string 'YES' as it is, without referencing any of the variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `count`) described in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variable values.
2. The string 'YES' is explicitly provided within the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **YES**
