The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `count`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string provided within it.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `count` are defined in the initial state.
2. The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.
3. The string 'YES' is explicitly provided within the `print` statement, and it does not depend on any of the variables defined in the initial state.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
