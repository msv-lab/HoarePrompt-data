The given `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

Let's analyze what this statement will print based on the provided initial state.

The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `count`), but the `print` statement does not use any of these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
