To determine what will be printed by the `print(ret)` statement, we need to understand the value of `ret` based on the given initial state.

**Initial State Recap:**
- `ret` is the count of `'@'` characters in the string `s` up to the point of breaking or the end of the string.
- `thorn` is defined based on the presence of two consecutive `'*'` characters in the string `s`, but it is not used in the `print(ret)` statement.

Since we are only interested in `ret`, we need to know the string `s` and the point at which the counting breaks or the end of the string is reached. However, the problem does not provide the exact string `s` or the specific breaking condition.

Given the lack of specific details about the string `s` and the breaking condition, we can only describe `ret` in terms of the conditions provided.

**Output Description:**
- `ret` is the count of `'@'` characters in the string `s` up to the point where the counting stops or the end of the string is reached.

Thus, the most precise description we can provide based on the given information is:

Output: **ret (where ret is the count of '@' characters in the string s up to the point of breaking or the end of the string)**
