The code snippet `len = int(input())` will assign the value of `int(input())` to the variable `len`. The variables `ret` and `thorn` remain unchanged as per the provided initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `len` while keeping `ret` and `thorn` as they were.

Output State: **`ret` is the count of '@' in `s`, `thorn` is 2 if loop breaks due to '\n', `len` is an input integer**.
