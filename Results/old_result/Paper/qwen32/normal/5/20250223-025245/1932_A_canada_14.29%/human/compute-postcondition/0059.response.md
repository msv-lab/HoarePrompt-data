Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `len` is an input integer, `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. If the current character `i` is not '@' and `i` is equal to `*`, `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `*`, `thorn` remains 0. `i` is the next character in the list `s`. `thorn` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `thorn` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their previous states.
