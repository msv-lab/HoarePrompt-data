The provided code snippet is `thorn == 0`, which is a comparison operation and does not assign any value to `thorn` or any other variable. Therefore, the values of `ret`, `thorn`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` remains 0; `thorn` is 2 if the current character `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was 2, otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was not 2, otherwise `thorn` remains 0; `len` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
