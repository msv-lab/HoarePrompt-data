The code snippet `s = list(input())` reads a string input from the user and converts it into a list of characters, which is then assigned to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `len` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string.**
