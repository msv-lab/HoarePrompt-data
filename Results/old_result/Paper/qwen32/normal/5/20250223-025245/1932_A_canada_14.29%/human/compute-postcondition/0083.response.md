Let's analyze the given for loop and the state before it starts.

The for loop is:
```
for i in s:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, `i` is the loop variable, and `s` is the iterable, which is a list of characters from the input string.

The state before the loop starts is:
- `ret` is 0
- `thorn` is 0
- `len` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`.

1. **Variable `s`**: This is the iterable in the loop. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one element since the loop will iterate over each element in `s`.

2. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop variable that will take on the value of each element in `s` during each iteration. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be initialized because it will be assigned a value from `s` in the first iteration.

Given this, the only state we need to adjust is `s` to ensure that it has at least one element. The variables `ret`, `thorn`, and `len` are not in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character**
