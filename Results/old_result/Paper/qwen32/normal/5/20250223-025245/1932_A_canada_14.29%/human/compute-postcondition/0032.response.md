Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, and `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`; `thorn` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `thorn` is increased by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
