Postcondition: **`ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` remains 0; `thorn` is 3 if the current character `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was 2, otherwise `thorn` is 2 if `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was not 2, otherwise `thorn` is 1; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `thorn` was 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
