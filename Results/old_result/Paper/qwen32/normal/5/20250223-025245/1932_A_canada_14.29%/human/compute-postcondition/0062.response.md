Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `len` is an input integer, `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. If the current character `i` is not '@' and `i` is equal to `*`, `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `*`, `thorn` remains 0. `i` is the next character in the list `s`. `thorn` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.`**

In simple terms: The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `s`, `len`, `ret`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `thorn` is increased by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited.
