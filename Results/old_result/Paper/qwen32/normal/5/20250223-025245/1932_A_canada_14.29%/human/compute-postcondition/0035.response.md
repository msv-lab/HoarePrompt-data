Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, and `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`. If `i` is equal to '*', then `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` was equal to 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `thorn` is increased by 1. If `i` is not equal to '*', the comparison `thorn == 0` does not affect the variables.**
