Output State: **`ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` remains 0; `thorn` is 3 if the current character `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was 2, otherwise `thorn` is 2 if `i` is '*' and the original `thorn` was not 2, otherwise `thorn` is 1; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ret` remains unchanged based on the condition provided in the initial state.
- The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. So, if `thorn` was 2 and `i` is '*', `thorn` becomes 3. If `thorn` was 1 or 0 and `i` is '*', `thorn` becomes 2. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` becomes 1.
- The values of `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
