The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `thorn` was 0, so the new value of `thorn` is 1. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1, and the current character `i` is equal to `'*'`.**
