N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99. The field is a 2D grid of size N x M where each cell contains either ".." (empty), "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" (players), "RG" or "BG" (goals), ".Q" (Quaffle), or ".B" (Bludger). T is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000. Each of the T actions is a valid command for a player or ball to move, catch, or throw the Quaffle.
