#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where a represents the number of lines (N) and b represents the number of columns (M) of the field, with 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and both a and b are odd. The field is described by a list of a strings, where each string contains b pairs of characters separated by spaces. Each pair of characters can be "..", "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9", "RG", "BG", ".Q", or ".B". The next input is an integer T (0 <= T <= 10000) representing the number of steps in the game, followed by T lines, each describing an action with a pair of characters representing the entity and a command (U, D, L, R, C, T).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns (a + b, a + b) where a and b are odd integers between 3 and 99, making a + b an even integer between 6 and 198.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of lines and columns of a field, respectively. It returns a tuple where each element is the sum of `a` and `b`.
