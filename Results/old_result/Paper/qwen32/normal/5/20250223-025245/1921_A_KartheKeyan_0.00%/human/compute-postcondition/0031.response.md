The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are new input integers, which implies that their previous values are not relevant. The rest of the variables (`n`, `coord`, `res`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Given that `x` and `y` are being reassigned with the values from the input, the output state will reflect these new values for `x` and `y`, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is a list with at least 6 elements (the original 5 elements plus the appended `(x, y)`), `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `x` and `y` are the new input integers, `i` is 4**.
