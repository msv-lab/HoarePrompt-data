Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all 4 iterations, `n` remains a non-zero value, `coord` will contain a list of 4 tuples, each representing a pair of integers `(x, y)` obtained from the input, and `res` will still be 0.
