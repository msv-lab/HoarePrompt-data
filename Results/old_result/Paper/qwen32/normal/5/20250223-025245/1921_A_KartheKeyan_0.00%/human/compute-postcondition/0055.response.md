The code calculates the value of `p2` based on the coordinates in the `coord` list. The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `p1` are not modified by the given code snippet. The value of `p2` is calculated as the squared Euclidean distance between the points `coord[3]` and `coord[2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be a non-zero value, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]` sorted by the default tuple comparison, `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`.**
