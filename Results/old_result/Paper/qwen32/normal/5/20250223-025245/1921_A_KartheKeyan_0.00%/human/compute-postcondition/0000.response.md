The provided code snippet appears to be unrelated to the initial state described. The initial state pertains to test cases involving coordinates of squares, while the code snippet processes a series of integers and calculates a value based on each integer.

Given the code snippet, here's the output state:

Initial State: There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, there are four lines of input, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area.

Code:
```
n = int(input())
     
while n :
        
    l = int(input())
    s = 0
    s += (l//4)+(l-(4*(l//4)))//2
    print(s)
    n-=1
```

The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l`, calculates a value `s` based on `l`, prints `s`, and then decrements `n` until `n` becomes 0.

Since the code provided does not utilize the coordinates of the squares mentioned in the initial state, the initial state concerning the squares remains unchanged. The code processes a separate set of integers `l` and prints results based on these integers.

Output State: **There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, there are four lines of input, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and positive area. The variable `n` has been decremented to 0 after processing all test cases. For each processed integer `l`, a value `s` is calculated and printed, where `s = (l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2`.**

In simpler terms: The initial state regarding the squares remains unchanged. The code processes `n` test cases, each involving an integer `l`, calculates and prints a value `s` for each `l`, and `n` is decremented to 0 after all test cases are processed.
