Output State: **`n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing the tuples `((x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4))`, `res` is 0.**

In natural language: After the loop completes all four iterations, `n` remains 1 and `res` remains 0. The `coord` list contains four tuples, each representing the coordinates `(x, y)` provided by the user in each of the four iterations.
