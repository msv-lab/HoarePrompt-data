Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and squaring it. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the y-coordinates, and it assumes the side length of the square is the difference in x-coordinates, which is not always true.

To correctly find the area of the square, the program should calculate the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the maximum and minimum y-coordinates, and then take the square of the larger of these two differences. Alternatively, it could compute the distance between any two adjacent points (which would be the side length of the square) and then square that distance.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        y = [p[1] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        dy = max(y) - min(y)
        side_length = max(dx, dy)
        print(side_length * side_length)

# or alternatively

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        a.sort()  # Sort to make it easier to find adjacent points
        side_length = max(abs(a[0][0] - a[1][0]), abs(a[0][1] - a[1][1]))
        print(side_length * side_length)
```

Both of these corrected versions will correctly compute the area of the square.
