The code snippet `x = [p[0] for p in a]` reassigns the list `x` to contain the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the 2D list `a`. This means that the previous values in `x` are discarded, and `x` is now specifically the list of the first elements of each sublist in `a`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `dx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `a` is a new 2D list containing 4 lists of integers from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the new `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the old `x`.**
