The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the loop. The loop executes `t` times, and since `_` is not used within the loop body, its value does not need to be adjusted. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration, as the loop condition depends on `t`.

Given that the loop will execute `t` times, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 lists of integers, where each inner list corresponds to the integers from one line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**
