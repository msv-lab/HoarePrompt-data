The given code snippet reassigns the variable `a` to a new 2D list constructed from the input. The new `a` consists of four lists, each containing integers input by the user. The variables `t`, `x`, and `dx` are not directly modified by this code snippet. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 99; `a` is a new 2D list containing 4 lists of integers from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in the old `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**
