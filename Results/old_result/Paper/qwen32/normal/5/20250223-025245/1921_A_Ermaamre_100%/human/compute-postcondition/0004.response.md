The code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`, which contains the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in `a`. The variable `dx` is assigned this difference. The initial state of `t`, `a`, and `x` remains unchanged except for the introduction of `dx`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 lists of integers, where each inner list corresponds to the integers from one line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 inner lists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**
