Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is updated based on the conditions: if `x // i <= k`, `l` becomes `[1, i, x // i]` if `i <= k` or `[1, x // i]` if `i > k`. Otherwise, `l` becomes `[1, i]` if `i <= k` or `[1]` if `i > k`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `l` remains unchanged and `ans` retains its previous value.**
