Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), `ans` is determined based on the conditions given, `i` is either the value of `i` from the previous iteration plus 2 if `x // i <= k`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged, and `l` is a list containing `ans`. If `x // i <= k`, `l` includes the updated `ans` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `i` and `l` remain unchanged.**
