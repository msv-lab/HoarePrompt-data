Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, and `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`). `ans` is `1`. `l` is `[1]` if `i > k`, or `[1, i]` if `i <= k`. `x % i == 0`, meaning `x` is divisible by `i`.**
