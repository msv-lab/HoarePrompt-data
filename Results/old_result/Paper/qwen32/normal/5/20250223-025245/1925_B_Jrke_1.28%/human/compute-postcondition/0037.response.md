The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is a common placeholder used when the loop variable is not actually used in the loop body. The loop iterates a number of times specified by the integer input.

Given that the loop head does not include `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, or `ans`, only the loop control variable `_` can be adjusted. However, since `_` is not used in the loop body, its value does not affect the logic of the loop. The loop will simply iterate the number of times specified by the integer input.

To prepare for the next iteration, there is no need to modify `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, or `ans`. The loop control variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as its value is not used.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n` (or `1` if `k` equals `1`), and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.**
