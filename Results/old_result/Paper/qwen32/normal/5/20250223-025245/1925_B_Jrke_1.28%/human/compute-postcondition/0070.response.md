Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input and is at least `1`, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, and `i` is `i + 4`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i <= k`, then `l` includes the new value `x // i` and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. Otherwise, `ans` and `l` remain unchanged. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**
