The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, but this variable is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input.**
