The code snippet `ans = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. The other variables `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, and `k` is `x // n`. If `k` equals 1, then `k` equals 1. Otherwise, there is no change to `k`. `ans` is 1.**
