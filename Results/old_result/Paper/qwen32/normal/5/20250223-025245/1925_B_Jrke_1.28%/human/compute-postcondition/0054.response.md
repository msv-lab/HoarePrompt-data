Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input and is at least 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i == 0`, then `l` is `[1, i, x // i]` if `i <= k` or `[1, x // i]` if `i > k`, and `ans` is the maximum value in this list. If `x % i != 0`, there is no change to `l` or `ans`.**
