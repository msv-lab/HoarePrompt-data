The code snippet provided sets the value of `ans` to 1. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged. The only change is that `ans` is explicitly set to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is 1.**
