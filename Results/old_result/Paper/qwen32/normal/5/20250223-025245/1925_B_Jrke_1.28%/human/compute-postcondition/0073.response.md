The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common placeholder in Python for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. Since the loop iterates over the range of an integer input, the state that needs to be adjusted is the integer input itself, which determines how many more times the loop will execute.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed once, so the remaining number of iterations is one less than the original input. Therefore, the integer input should be decremented by 1 to reflect the state at the start of the next iteration.

No other variables in the provided state (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`) are part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is `x // n`, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. The integer input is decremented by 1.**
