Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is greater than 0.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
4. `d` is defined as `c / 2`. Since `c` is an integer, `d` will be the integer division of `c` by 2, which means `d` is the floor of `c / 2`.
5. The comparison `a * b` vs `a * d` is made, but this comparison does not affect the value of `d` or the print statement.
6. `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not used in the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(round(a * d))
```

### Analysis:
- `d` is defined as `c / 2` using integer division. This means `d = c // 2`.
- The expression `a * d` involves multiplying `a` with the integer division result of `c` by 2.
- The `round` function is applied to `a * d`. However, since `d` is already an integer (result of integer division), `a * d` is also an integer, and applying `round` to an integer does not change its value.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `a * d`, which is `a` multiplied by the integer division of `c` by 2.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * (c // 2)**
