The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This means the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated based on the input provided.

The variables `t`, `n`, `d`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Specifically:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `d` remains `c / 2` (but since `c` changes, `d` will now be `(new_c) / 2`).
- `i` remains `i + 1` (but since `i` is not used in the code snippet, its value remains as it was).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2` (where `c` is the newly read value), `i` is `i + 1`**.
