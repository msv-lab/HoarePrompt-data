Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it is correct according to the problem description.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Inputs:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b`:
     - `n`: Number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy.
     - `a`: Price of one yogurt.
     - `b`: Price of two yogurts on promotion.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.

### Analysis of the Program:
The given program has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem.

#### Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues:
1. **Variable Naming:**
   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used, but according to the problem description, they should be `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The variable `c` should be `b` as per the problem statement.

2. **Logic Error:**
   - The current logic is incorrect. The program is trying to compare `a * b` (which is incorrect as it should be `b` for two yogurts) with `a * d` (which is incorrect as `d` is not defined correctly).
   - The correct approach is to calculate the minimum cost by considering the best combination of buying yogurts in pairs and individually.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Cost:**
   - To find the minimum cost, we need to:
     - Calculate how many pairs of yogurts (`n // 2`) can be bought at the promotion price `b`.
     - Calculate the remaining yogurts (`n % 2`) that need to be bought at the regular price `a`.
     - The total cost will be `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`.

### Corrected Approach:
Here's the corrected version of the program based on the above analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remainder = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + remainder * a
        print(total_cost)

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to improper variable naming and logic errors. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
