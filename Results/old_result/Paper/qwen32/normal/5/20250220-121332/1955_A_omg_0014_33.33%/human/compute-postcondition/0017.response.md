Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `d` is now `c / 2`, and the value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
