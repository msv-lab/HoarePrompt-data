Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`, and `i` is `i + 1`. The condition `a * b < a * d` is evaluated, but the postcondition does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, or `i` regardless of whether the condition is true or false.**
