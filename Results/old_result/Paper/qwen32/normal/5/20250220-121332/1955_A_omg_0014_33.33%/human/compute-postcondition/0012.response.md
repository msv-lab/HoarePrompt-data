To determine what will be printed by the `print(a * b)` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is greater than 0.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
4. `d` is defined as `c / 2`.
5. There is a comparison between `a * b` and `a * d`. However, the result of this comparison does not affect the `print(a * b)` statement directly.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(a * b)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(a * b)` statement will output the product of `a` and `b`.
- The comparison `a * b < a * d` is given, but it does not influence the output of the `print(a * b)` statement.
- The value of `d` is `c / 2`, but `d` is not used in the `print(a * b)` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print(a * b)` statement will print the product of the integers `a` and `b`.

### Output:
Output: **a * b (where a and b are integers read from the input)**
