Reasoning:  
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described. Here are the main points:

1. **Misinterpretation of Inputs**: The program reads `n` as the number of test cases, but then it attempts to read `a`, `b`, and `c` in each iteration of the loop. This is incorrect because `n` is the number of yogurts, and `a` and `b` are the prices, not the number of test cases.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, but this is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires determining the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts, either by buying them individually at price `a` or in pairs at price `b`.

3. **Condition Logic Error**: The condition `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect and does not reflect the logic needed to solve the problem. The correct logic should compare the cost of buying yogurts in pairs versus buying them individually.

4. **Output Logic Error**: The program prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)`, which are not the correct values to print. It should calculate the minimum cost based on the number of yogurts and the given prices.

The correct approach should be:
- Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought, which is `n // 2`.
- Calculate the number of single yogurts that need to be bought, which is `n % 2`.
- Compute the total cost as `number_of_pairs * b + number_of_single_yogurts * a`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        singles = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(total_cost)

#State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer representing the number of yogurts, `a` and `b` are integers representing the prices, and for each test case, the program calculates and prints the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.
```

Correctness: **False**
