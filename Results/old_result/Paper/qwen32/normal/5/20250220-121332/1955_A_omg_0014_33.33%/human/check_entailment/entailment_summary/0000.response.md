Reasoning:  
The program provided contains a logical error in how it calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. The logic in the program is flawed because it incorrectly calculates `d` as half of `c` and then uses `a * b` and `a * d` for comparison, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issues:

1. **Misinterpretation of Variables:**
   - The input variables are `n`, `a`, and `b`, where:
     - `n` is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy.
     - `a` is the price for one yogurt.
     - `b` is the price for two yogurts on promotion.
   - The program mistakenly uses `c` instead of `b` for the promotion price, and calculates `d` as `c / 2` which is incorrect. The correct variable to use for the promotion price is `b`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Cost Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly compares `a * b` (which should be `a * n` for `n` yogurts at the regular price) with `a * d` (which is not a valid comparison for the problem).
   - To solve the problem, we need to calculate the cost in terms of how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many yogurts will be bought at the regular price if any.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts (`n // 2`) that can be bought at the promotion price `b`.
   - Calculate the remaining yogurts (`n % 2`) that need to be bought at the regular price `a`.
   - The total cost is then `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
