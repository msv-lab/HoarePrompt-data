The code snippet assigns the value of `c` divided by 2 to the variable `d`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, except for `d`, which is now equal to `c / 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input, `d` is `c / 2`.**
