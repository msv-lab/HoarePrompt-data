The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as integers, while `t` and `n` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.**
