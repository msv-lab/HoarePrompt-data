Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts given the following:
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price of two yogurts with a promotion is `b` burles.

The goal is to minimize the total cost. To achieve this, we need to decide whether to buy yogurts in pairs (taking advantage of the promotion) or individually.

### Correct Approach
To find the minimum cost:
1. Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts Maxim can buy: `num_pairs = n // 2`.
2. Calculate the cost if Maxim buys all pairs at the promotion price: `cost_pairs = num_pairs * b`.
3. Calculate the number of remaining yogurts (if `n` is odd): `remaining_yogurts = n % 2`.
4. Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurts at the regular price: `cost_remaining = remaining_yogurts * a`.
5. The total minimum cost is the sum of `cost_pairs` and `cost_remaining`.

### Program Analysis
Let's examine the provided program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The program expects the input format as `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`, but according to the problem, the correct format should be `(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())` where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts with a promotion.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d = c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the context of the problem. It seems like an attempt to calculate the cost of one yogurt if bought in pairs, but this is not the correct approach.
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic `if a * b < a * d:` is incorrect. The condition should compare the cost of buying pairs versus buying individually.
4. **Output Calculation**: The output calculation is incorrect. It should be based on the total cost of pairs and remaining yogurts, not the incorrect intermediate calculations.

### Correct Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        num_pairs = n // 2
        remaining_yogurts = n % 2
        cost_pairs = num_pairs * b
        cost_remaining = remaining_yogurts * a
        total_cost = cost_pairs + cost_remaining
        print(total_cost)

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect due to improper input parsing, incorrect calculations, and incorrect logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
