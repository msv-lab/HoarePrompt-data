The code snippet provided increments the variable `s` by the integer value of the element at the index `i` in the sorted list `list2`. Given that `i` is `i + 2`, the value added to `s` is `int(list2[i + 2])`.

Output State: **`list2` is sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 element; `str` is undefined; `n` is unchanged; `s` is `s + int(list2[i + 2])`; `a` is unchanged; `b` is unchanged; `final` is unchanged; `num` is unchanged; `i` is `i + 2`.**

In simple terms, the variable `s` is now increased by the value of the element at the index `i + 2` in the sorted list `list2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
