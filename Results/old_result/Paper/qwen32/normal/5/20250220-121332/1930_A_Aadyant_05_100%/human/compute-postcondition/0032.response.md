To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for str in list1:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variables in the loop head are `str` and `list1`. Therefore, only these can be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50.
- `s` is 0.
- `list2` is an empty list.
- `a` is the user's input.
- `b` is the new user's input string.
- `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`.
- `str` is undefined.
- `final` contains the value of `s` appended to it.
- `num` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute, `list1` must have at least one element since the loop iterates over `list1`. The variable `str` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it will be assigned the value of each element in `list1` during each iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `list1` is not empty.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the new user's input string, `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` that must have at least 1 element, `str` is undefined, `final` contains the value of `s` appended to it, `num` is incremented by 1**
