The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of words and assigns this list to `list1`. The values of `n`, `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, `str`, `final`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `a` is the new user's input; `b` is the user's input string (updated); `list1` is a list of words from `b`; `str` is undefined; `final` contains the previous values of `final` plus `s`; `num` is `num + 1`.**
