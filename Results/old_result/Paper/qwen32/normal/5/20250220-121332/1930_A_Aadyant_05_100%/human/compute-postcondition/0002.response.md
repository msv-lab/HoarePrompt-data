To ensure that the `for` loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for num in range(int(n)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `n`. Since `num` is the loop variable that gets assigned values from the range, it doesn't need to be adjusted before the loop starts. However, `n` is crucial because it determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. Since `n` is given as half the number of integers on the whiteboard, and it is ensured to be between 1 and 50, we don't need to adjust `n` in terms of its value range. We just need to ensure that it is correctly interpreted as an integer and that the range is non-empty.

Here’s the state we need before the loop starts:

- `n` must be an integer and at least 1 (which is already ensured by the problem constraints).
- `num` does not need to be adjusted because it is assigned values within the loop.

The other variables mentioned (`t`, the list of integers, and `final`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `num` is not adjusted, `t` is the number of test cases, the list of integers is provided as per the input, `final` is an empty list**.

However, since only the state of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, we can simplify this to:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50**.
