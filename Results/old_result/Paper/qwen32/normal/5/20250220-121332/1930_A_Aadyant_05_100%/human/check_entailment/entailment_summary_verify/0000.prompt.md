You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of the integers located at even indices in the sorted list. The function then prints the sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the input format as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it incorrectly reads two lines of input: one for `n` and another for the list of integers. However, according to the problem description, the input format for each test case should be two lines where the first line contains `n` and the second line contains `2n` integers.

Here's a corrected version of the input reading logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())  # Read n for the current test case
        list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the 2n integers for the current test case
        list1.sort()
        s = sum(list1[i] for i in range(0, len(list1), 2))  # Sum the minimum of each pair
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In the original code, the line `a = input()` is unnecessary and does not serve any purpose. Additionally, the line `b = input()` should be used to read the list of integers, but it is incorrectly used to read the integers into `list1` which should be done in a single line.

Here is a specific case where the original program would fail:

**Input:**
```
1
2
1 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output of Original Program:**
The program would likely throw an error or produce incorrect output because it expects to read `n` and then `2n` integers on separate lines for each test case.

Thus, the original program is incorrect due to improper handling of the input format.
