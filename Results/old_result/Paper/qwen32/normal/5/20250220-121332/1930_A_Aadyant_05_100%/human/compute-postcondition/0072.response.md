The only variable in the loop head is `fin`, which is an element from the list `final`. For the loop to execute, `final` must be a list with at least one element. The state of `final` is the only thing we can adjust according to the loop head.

Since the loop iterates over `final`, for the loop to execute, `final` must contain at least one element. The state of `fin` itself does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is assigned during each iteration.

State: **`final` is a list of n sums, where each sum is the sum of the integers at even indices of the sorted list of integers provided in each iteration, and `final` must have at least one element**.
