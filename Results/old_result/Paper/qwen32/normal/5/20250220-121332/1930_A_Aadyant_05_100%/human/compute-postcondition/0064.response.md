The code snippet `s = s + int(list2[i])` adds the integer value of the element at index `i` in `list2` to the current value of `s`. Since `list2` is sorted in ascending order and has at least one element, `list2[i]` is a specific element in the list. The variables `str`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `final`, and `num` are unchanged.

Output State: **`list2` is sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 element; `str` is undefined; `n` is unchanged; `s` is `s` + `int(list2[i])`; `a` is unchanged; `b` is unchanged; `final` is unchanged; `num` is unchanged**.
