The code snippet `list2 = []` resets `list2` to an empty list, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b`; `str` is the last element in `list1`; `final` contains the value of `s` appended to it; `num` is incremented by 1.**
