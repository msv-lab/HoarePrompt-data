The code appends the integer value of `str` (which is the second element in `list1`) to `list2`. The values of `n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` remain unchanged. The only change is that `list2` now includes an additional element, which is the integer conversion of `str`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `a` and the integer value of `str`; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b`, and `list1` must have at least two elements; `str` is the second element in `list1`.**
