The code appends the integer value of `str` (which is the second element of `list1`) to `list2`. 

Given that `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` and `str` is the second element of `list1`, `str` must be a string that can be converted to an integer. Let's denote the integer value of `str` as `int(str)`.

The initial state of `list2` is `[10]`. After appending `int(str)` to `list2`, `list2` becomes `[10, int(str)]`.

The other variables (`n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, `str`, `final`, and `num`) are not directly affected by the code snippet provided.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `s` is 0, `list2` is [10, int(str)], `a` is the user's input, `b` is the new user's input string, `list1` is a list of substrings from `b` that must have at least 2 elements, `str` is the second element of `list1`, `final` contains the value of `s` appended to it, `num` is incremented by 1**.
