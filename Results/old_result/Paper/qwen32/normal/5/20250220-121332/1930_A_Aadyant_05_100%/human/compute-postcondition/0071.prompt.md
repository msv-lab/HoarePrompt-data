Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard. This is followed by a line containing 2`n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2`n`} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases, `t`, is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an input integer. `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for num in range(int(n)):
    s = 0
    list2 = []
    a = input()
    list1 = []
    b = input()
    list1 = b.split()
    for str in list1:
        list2.append(int(str))
    list2.sort()
    for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
        s = s + int(list2[i])
    final.append(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is the sum of the integer values of `list2[i]` for all even indices `i`; `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, sorted in ascending order; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b`; `str` is the last element in `list1`; `final` contains the value of `s` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is the sum of all integers at even indices in `list2`; `list2` is a sorted list of integers; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the new user's input string; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`; `str` is undefined; `final` contains the previous values of `final` plus `s`; `num` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `list2` is sorted in ascending order; `str` is undefined; `n` is unchanged; `s` is the sum of the integer values of the elements at even indices of `list2`; `a` is unchanged; `b` is unchanged; `final` includes `s` as its last element; `num` is unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
