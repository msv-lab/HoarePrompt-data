The provided code snippet only reads an input value and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, this input value represents half the number of integers on the whiteboard for a test case. The other variables mentioned (the integers on the whiteboard) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `n` is updated to the input value, and the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), representing half the number of integers on the whiteboard. This is followed by a line containing 2`n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2`n`} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. The total number of test cases, `t`, is given at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is an input integer.**
