The code attempts to append an integer value derived from `str` to `list2`. However, the initial state does not define `str` or `list2`. Since `str` is undefined, converting it to an integer will raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, the code will not successfully execute as intended, and `list2` remains unchanged. The precondition that `list1` is a list of words from `b` with at least one word still holds, but `str` remains undefined and `list2` is not modified.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 1 word, `str` is undefined, `list2` is unchanged and not specified in the initial state**.
