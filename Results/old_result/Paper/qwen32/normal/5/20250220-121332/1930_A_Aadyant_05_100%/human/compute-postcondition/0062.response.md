The code snippet `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. The values of `str`, `n`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `final`, and `num` remain unchanged. The only change is that `list2` is now sorted.

Output State: **`list2` is sorted in ascending order; `str` is undefined; `n` is unchanged; `s` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `b` is unchanged; `final` is unchanged; `num` is unchanged.**
