The code attempts to append an integer value derived from the string `str` to `list2`. However, the initial state does not mention a variable named `str`. Given the examples and the context, it seems there might be a typo in the code snippet, and it should be `a` instead of `str` since `a` is the only string provided by the user.

Assuming the code snippet is:
```
list2.append(int(a))
```

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `a`; `a` is a string provided by the user; `b` is a string provided by the user that, when split, results in a non-empty list; `list1` is a list of words obtained by splitting the string `b`, and `list1` must have at least one element.**

In simpler terms, `list2` now contains the integer value of the string `a`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
