The code snippet `final.append(s)` appends the value of `s` to the list `final`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `s` is the sum of the integer values of the elements at even indices of `list2`, and `list2` is sorted in ascending order. The variables `str`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `num` are unchanged. The variable `final` now includes the value of `s` as its last element.

Output State: **`list2` is sorted in ascending order; `str` is undefined; `n` is unchanged; `s` is the sum of the integer values of the elements at even indices of `list2`; `a` is unchanged; `b` is unchanged; `final` includes `s` as its last element; `num` is unchanged.**
