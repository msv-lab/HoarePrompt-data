The code snippet `list2 = []` reassigns `list2` to be an empty list. This change affects `list2` only, and all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is 0; `list2` is an empty list; `a` is the user's input; `b` is the new user's input string; `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`; `str` is undefined; `final` contains the previous values of `final` plus `s`; `num` is `num + 1`.**
