To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze if the provided code correctly solves the problem described. However, the provided code does not contain the main logic to solve the problem; it only includes functions to read input. The actual logic to find the number of swaps and perform the binary search is missing.

Let's break down the problem and the steps required to solve it:

1. **Input Reading**: The program should correctly read the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should read the size of the permutation `n`, the target number `x`, and the permutation `p`.

2. **Logic to Solve the Problem**:
   - **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search algorithm requires a sorted array. Since the array is a permutation, we can use at most two swaps to manipulate the array in such a way that after the binary search, `p_l` (the element at the final left index) is equal to `x`.
   - **Swapping Strategy**: The strategy involves finding the position of `x` in the permutation and strategically placing it such that the binary search ends with `p_l` being `x`.

3. **Output**: For each test case, the program should output the number of swaps performed (0, 1, or 2) and the indices of the elements that were swapped.

The provided code only includes functions to read input, and it does not contain any logic to determine the swaps or perform the binary search. Therefore, the provided code is incomplete and cannot be considered correct for solving the given problem.

**Reasoning**:
- The code lacks the main logic to solve the problem.
- It does not perform any operations to manipulate the array or perform the binary search.
- It does not output the required results.

**Conclusion**:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not include the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
