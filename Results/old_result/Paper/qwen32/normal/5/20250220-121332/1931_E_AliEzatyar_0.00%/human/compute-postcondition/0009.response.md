Output State: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the current index decremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the list `num` retains its initial state as a list of integers with at least one element. The variable `i` is still the current index decremented by 1. The `break` statement does not affect the values of `num` or `i`; it only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
