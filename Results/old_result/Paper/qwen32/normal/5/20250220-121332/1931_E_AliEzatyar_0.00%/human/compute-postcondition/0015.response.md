To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over the list `num` in reverse order, checking if each element is equal to '0'. If an element is '0', it increments the `counter`. If an element is not '0', it breaks out of the loop.

Given the loop's behavior, the loop will stop as soon as it encounters a non-zero element while iterating in reverse. Therefore, the final state will depend on the position of the last '0' in the list `num`.

Let's break down the loop's final state:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop starts from the last index (`len(num) - 1`) and decrements the index `i` until it either encounters a non-zero element or finishes iterating over the entire list.
2. **Counter Increment**: Each time it encounters a '0', it increments the `counter`.
3. **Loop Termination**: The loop terminates as soon as it encounters a non-zero element.

### Final Output State
The final output state will be determined by:
- The number of trailing '0's in the list `num`. This will be the final value of `counter`.
- The loop will stop as soon as it encounters a non-zero element from the end, so the index `i` will be the position just before this non-zero element.

### Example
If `num` is `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, the loop will execute 3 times, and the final state will be:
- `counter` will be 3 because there are 3 trailing '0's.
- `i` will be 0 because the loop will stop at the first non-zero element (which is at index 0).

If `num` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, the loop will execute 2 times, and the final state will be:
- `counter` will be 2 because there are 2 trailing '0's.
- `i` will be 1 because the loop will stop at the first non-zero element (which is at index 2).

### General Case
In the general case, the loop will stop at the first non-zero element from the end of the list, and `counter` will be the number of trailing '0's in the list.

### Conclusion
The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be:
- `counter` will hold the number of trailing '0's in the list `num`.
- `i` will be the index of the first non-zero element from the end of the list, or -1 if the entire list consists of '0's.

Output State: **`counter` is the number of trailing '0's in `num`, and `i` is the index of the first non-zero element from the end of the list, or -1 if the entire list consists of '0's.**
