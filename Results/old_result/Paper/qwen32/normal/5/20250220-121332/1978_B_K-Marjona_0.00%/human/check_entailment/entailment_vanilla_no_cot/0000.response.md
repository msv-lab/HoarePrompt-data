Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The issue lies in the calculation of `k` and how the profit is computed based on `k`.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the problem and the correct approach:

1. **Determine `k`:** The optimal `k` is the number of buns to sell at the modified price. The modified price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)`. This price is higher than the usual price `a` as long as `b - i + 1 > a`. This implies `i < b - a + 1`. Therefore, the maximum `k` is `min(n, b - a + 1)`.

2. **Compute the profit:**
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2`.
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns is `(n - k) * a`.

The program currently sets `k = min(n, b - a)`, which is incorrect. It should be `k = min(n, b - a + 1)`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a + 1)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2 + (n - k) * a)

func()
```

With this correction, the program should now correctly compute the maximum profit for each test case.
