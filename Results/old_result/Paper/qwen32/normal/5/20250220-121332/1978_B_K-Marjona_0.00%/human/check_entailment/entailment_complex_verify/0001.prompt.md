You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

    #State: The loop has processed `t` test cases, and the last values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are those from the final iteration. The value of `t` remains as the initial input value but is no longer relevant to the loop control.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a number of test cases specified by `t`. For each test case, it takes three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, and prints a computed value based on these inputs. The computed value is determined by whether `b` is less than or equal to `a` or greater than `a`, using specific arithmetic operations to derive the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

Bob is selling `n` buns. The usual price of each bun is `a` coins. However, he can apply a promotion where the first `k` buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from `b` coins for the first bun, `b-1` coins for the second bun, and so on until `b-k+1` coins for the `k`-th bun. The remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each. The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

### Key Points

1. **Promotion Price Calculation:**
   - For the first `k` buns, the total price can be calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) * k / 2`.

2. **Usual Price Calculation:**
   - For the remaining `n-k` buns, the total price is `(n - k) * a`.

3. **Choosing `k`:**
   - `k` should be chosen such that the total price is maximized. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a + 1` because beyond `b - a + 1`, the price of the buns would become less than or equal to `a`, and it would be better to sell them at the usual price.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the program to see if it correctly implements the above logic.

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a + 1)  # Corrected to b - a + 1
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Value of `k`:**
   - The original program has `k = min(n, b - a)`. This is incorrect because `k` should be `min(n, b - a + 1)`. The price of the `k`-th bun is `b - k + 1`, and this should be at least `a` to make the promotion beneficial. Hence, `k` should be the maximum value such that `b - k + 1 >= a`, which simplifies to `k <= b - a + 1`.

2. **Handling `b <= a`:**
   - The program correctly checks if `b <= a` and prints `a * n` in that case, as selling all buns at the usual price would be optimal.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a + 1)  # Corrected to b - a + 1
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

### Conclusion

The program is almost correct, but there is a small mistake in the calculation of `k`. The correct value of `k` should be `min(n, b - a + 1)` instead of `min(n, b - a)`. Given the original program, the correctness is **False** because of this mistake.

Correctness: **False**
