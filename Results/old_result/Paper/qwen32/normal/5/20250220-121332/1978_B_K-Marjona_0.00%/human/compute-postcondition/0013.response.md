Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; `b` is compared to `a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is set to the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a`, `k` is still set to the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**
