The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state only mentions `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000. Since `n`, `a`, and `b` are not mentioned in the initial state, they can be considered as being undefined or uninitialized before this line of code. After executing the code, `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the integer values provided by the input, split by spaces.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces.**
