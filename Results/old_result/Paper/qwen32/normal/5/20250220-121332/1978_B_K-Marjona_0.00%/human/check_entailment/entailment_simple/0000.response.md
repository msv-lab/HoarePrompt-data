### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling his buns under the specified promotion rules. The key is to determine the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified prices.

#### Key Points:
1. **Promotion Rules**:
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a decreasing price starting from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \).
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Objective**:
   - Maximize the total revenue from selling all \( n \) buns.

3. **Approach**:
   - If \( b \leq a \), selling all buns at the usual price is optimal since the promotion price is not beneficial.
   - If \( b > a \), calculate the revenue for different values of \( k \) and choose the one that maximizes the total revenue.
   - The optimal \( k \) is the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \) because selling more than \( b - a \) buns at the modified price does not increase the price further.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
- It calculates \( k \) as the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \).
- If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \) (selling all buns at the usual price).
- Otherwise, it calculates the total revenue by summing up the revenue from the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price.

#### Calculation of Revenue:
- For the first \( k \) buns, the prices are \( b, b-1, \ldots, b-k+1 \).
- The sum of these prices is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2} \).
- The revenue from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is \( (n - k) \times a \).
- The total revenue is the sum of these two amounts.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit based on the given conditions. It handles both scenarios where the promotion price is beneficial and where it is not. The calculations for the revenue are accurate.
