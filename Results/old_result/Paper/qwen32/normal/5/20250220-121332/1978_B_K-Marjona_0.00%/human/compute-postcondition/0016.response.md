Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**

In simple terms, the variable `k` is now assigned the smaller value between `n` and the difference between `b` and `a`. All other variables retain their initial states.
