### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling his buns under the promotion rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n` (number of buns), `a` (usual price of a bun), and `b` (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price).

2. **Calculation of `k`:**
   - `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and is bounded by the difference between `b` and `a`. This is because selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would not be beneficial since the price would drop below the usual price `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means that the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns are sold at the usual price `a`, resulting in a profit of `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the program calculates the profit by summing up the prices of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The sum of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`. This formula calculates the sum of the sequence `b, b-1, b-2, ..., b-k+1`.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the total profit.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the computed profit for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 4 5`
  - Calculation: `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Profit: `(5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) // 2 * 1 + (4 - 1) * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`
  - Output: `17`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5 5 9`
  - Calculation: `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
  - Profit: `(9 + (9 - 4 + 1)) // 2 * 4 + (5 - 4) * 5 = 35`
  - Output: `35`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `10 10 5`
  - Calculation: `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0` (since `b - a` is negative, `k` is 0)
  - Profit: `10 * 10 = 100`
  - Output: `100`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `5 5 11`
  - Calculation: `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Profit: `(11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) // 2 * 5 = 45`
  - Output: `45`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000`
  - Output: `1000000000000000000`

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
  - Calculation: `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000`
  - Output: `1000000000000000000`

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `1000 1 1000`
  - Calculation: `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Profit: `(1000 + (1000 - 999 + 1)) // 2 * 999 + (1000 - 999) * 1 = 500500`
  - Output: `500500`
