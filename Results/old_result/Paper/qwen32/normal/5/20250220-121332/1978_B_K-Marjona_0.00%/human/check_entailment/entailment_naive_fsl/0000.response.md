Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The issue lies in the calculation of `k` and the subsequent profit calculation.

Here are the specific issues:

1. **Calculation of `k`**: The program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the case where selling some buns at the modified price could yield a higher profit than selling all at the usual price or a different number of buns at the modified price.

2. **Profit Calculation**: The program calculates the profit based on the incorrect `k`. It sums the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1` and adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`. However, this does not guarantee the maximum profit.

### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum profit, we need to consider selling up to `n` buns at the modified price and compare the total profit for each possible `k` from `0` to `n`. Specifically, for each `k`, the profit can be calculated as:
- Sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.
- Plus the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

The correct way to calculate the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series is:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k \cdot (b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \]

The total profit for a given `k` is:
\[ \text{Profit}(k) = \frac{k \cdot (b + (b - k + 1))}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \]

We need to iterate over all possible values of `k` from `0` to `n` and find the maximum profit.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the test case:
```
1
5 5 9
```
The program calculates `k` as `min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`. The profit calculation for `k = 4` is:
\[ \text{Profit}(4) = \frac{4 \cdot (9 + (9 - 4 + 1))}{2} + (5 - 4) \cdot 5 = \frac{4 \cdot 15}{2} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \]
This is correct for this specific case, but the program does not guarantee this for all cases.

However, consider another test case:
```
1
5 5 11
```
The program calculates `k` as `min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`. The profit calculation for `k = 5` is:
\[ \text{Profit}(5) = \frac{5 \cdot (11 + (11 - 5 + 1))}{2} + (5 - 5) \cdot 5 = \frac{5 \cdot 17}{2} + 0 = 42.5 \]
Since the profit must be an integer, this indicates an issue with the logic. The correct approach should be to iterate over all `k` from `0` to `5` and find the maximum profit.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = (k * (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This corrected program ensures that the maximum profit is calculated by considering all possible values of `k` from `0` to `n`.
