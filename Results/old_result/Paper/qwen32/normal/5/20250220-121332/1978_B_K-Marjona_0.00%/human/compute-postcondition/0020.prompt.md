Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = min(n, b - a)
    if b <= a:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` is less than or equal to `a` and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a` and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 0 <= t - 1 <= 10^4; `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; `b` is compared to `a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is set to the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than `a`, `k` is still set to the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers provided by the input, split by spaces; `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part. In both cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `k` is calculated as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
