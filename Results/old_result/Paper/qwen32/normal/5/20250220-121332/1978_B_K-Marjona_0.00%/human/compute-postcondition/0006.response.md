To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the expression step-by-step using the provided initial state:

1. **Variables and their meanings:**
   - `t`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b`: Integers provided by the input, split by spaces.
   - `b`: Greater than `a`.
   - `k`: The minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   The print statement contains the following expression:
   ```python
   (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a
   ```
   
   Let's break it down into parts:
   - **Part 1:** `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`
     - `b - k + 1`: This is the difference between `b` and `k` plus 1.
     - `b + (b - k + 1)`: This is the sum of `b` and the result of `b - k + 1`.
     - `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2`: This is the integer division of the sum by 2.
     - `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`: This is the result of the integer division multiplied by `k`.
   
   - **Part 2:** `(n - k) * a`
     - `n - k`: This is the difference between `n` and `k`.
     - `(n - k) * a`: This is the result of the difference multiplied by `a`.

3. **Combining the Parts:**
   - The final expression combines both parts with an addition:
     ```python
     (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a
     ```

4. **Explanation of Output:**
   - The first part of the expression calculates a value based on `b` and `k`, representing a sum of an arithmetic sequence up to `k` terms.
   - The second part calculates a value based on `n`, `k`, and `a`, representing a linear combination of `n` and `a`.
   - The final output is the sum of these two parts.

Given the information, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without specific values for `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`. However, the structure of the expression and the roles of the variables are clear.

Output: **The expression calculates and prints \((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a\) where \(k\) is the minimum of \(n\) and \(b - a\).**
