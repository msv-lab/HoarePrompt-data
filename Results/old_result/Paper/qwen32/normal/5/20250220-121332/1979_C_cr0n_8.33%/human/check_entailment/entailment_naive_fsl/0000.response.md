Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly distribute the bets to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Let's analyze the program and find a potential case where it fails.

The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each multiplier to get a list of bets. It then checks if the difference between the product and the sum of these bets is greater than zero. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints -1.

However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. The bets calculated in this way do not necessarily satisfy the condition for all possible winning outcomes.

Let's consider an example:

**Input:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1 1
```

In this case, if we bet 1 coin on each outcome, the total amount of coins bet is 3. If any outcome wins, we receive back 2 coins, which is not strictly greater than 3. Therefore, this distribution does not satisfy the condition. The program should output -1 for this input.

However, the program will output `1 1 1` for this input, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Another Example:**

**Input:**
```
1
2
3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1
```

In this case, if we bet 1 coin on each outcome, the total amount of coins bet is 2. If any outcome wins, we receive back 3 coins, which is strictly greater than 2. Therefore, this distribution satisfies the condition. The program correctly outputs `1 1` for this input.

However, as shown in the first example, the program fails to correctly identify cases where no valid distribution exists.

Thus, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
