The code snippet provided is `prod *= r`. This line multiplies the current value of `prod` by the value of `r` and assigns the result back to `prod`. However, `r` is not defined in the initial state provided. Assuming `r` is a variable that has been defined somewhere in the code prior to this snippet, we can only update `prod` based on its interaction with `r`.

Given the initial state, `prod` is initially 1. After executing `prod *= r`, the new value of `prod` will be `1 * r`, which simplifies to `r`.

Since `r` is not specified in the initial state, we can only express the new state in terms of `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers where each `k_i` satisfies 2 <= `k_i` <= 20; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one integer; `prod` is `r`.**
