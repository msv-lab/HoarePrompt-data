Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is 1; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. All other variables (`t`, `data`, `index`, and `T`) remain unchanged.
