The code snippet appends the string representation of `last_year` to the list `results`. Therefore, the list `results` will now include the string representation of `last_year` as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` now includes `str(last_year)` as its last element.**
