The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `next_year` is `last_year + a[i]`.
- `last_year` is `last_year + a[i]`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 from its current value (which was incremented at the end of the previous iteration). The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 4 at the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is unchanged**. 

Note: The states of `next_year` and `last_year` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. However, for completeness, we know that at the start of the next iteration, `last_year` will be updated to `last_year + a[4]` and `next_year` will also be `last_year + a[4]` within the loop body.
