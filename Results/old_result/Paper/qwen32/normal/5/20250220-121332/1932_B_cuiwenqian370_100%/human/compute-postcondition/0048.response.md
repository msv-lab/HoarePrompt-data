Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `last_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`**

Explanation: The value of `last_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`, which is calculated as `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The expression for `next_year` remains valid and is now also the expression for the updated `last_year`.
