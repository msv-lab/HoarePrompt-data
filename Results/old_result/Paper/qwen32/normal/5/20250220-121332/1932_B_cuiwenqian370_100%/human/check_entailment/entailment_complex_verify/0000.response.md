### Reasoning:

The original assessment thoroughly analyzed the problem description, the provided program code, and the test cases. The logic and implementation of the program were correctly evaluated against the problem requirements. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to ensure the reasoning is sound:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the total number of test cases `T` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Logic for Calculating the Year:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the first sign's occurrence year, which is `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program appends the final year (`last_year`) to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints all results, one per line.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - The original assessment provided detailed explanations for each test case, showing that the program produces the correct output.
   - The calculations and logic were verified step-by-step for each test case, and the results matched the expected outputs.

### Annotations:
The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code confirm the state of the program at key points:
- The `index` variable correctly tracks the position in the input data.
- The `results` list correctly accumulates the final year for each test case.
- The `last_year` variable correctly updates to the next occurrence year for each sign.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the year in which the `n`-th sign will occur for each test case, as verified by the provided test cases and the detailed analysis in the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
