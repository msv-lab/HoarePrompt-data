The given code snippet calculates the value of `next_year` based on the current `last_year` and an element from the list `a` at index `i`. The initial state provides the values for `t`, `data`, `index`, `T`, `results`, `n`, `a`, and `last_year`. The calculation for `next_year` involves arithmetic operations and integer division. 

Here's the calculation:
- `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`
- Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses: `last_year + a[i]`
- The expression then becomes: `next_year = (last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`
- This means `next_year` will be the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + a[i]`.

Given that `last_year` is `a[0]`, the value of `next_year` will be the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `a[0] + a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, with `data[0]` being a string representation of an integer T such that 1 <= T <= 1000; `index` is `2 + n`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]` and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[2:2+n]`; `last_year` is `a[0]`; `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `a[0] + a[i]`.**
