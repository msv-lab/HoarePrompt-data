You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a final value based on the provided integers and outputs these final values, one per line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided code to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
1. We need to find the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and the next sign can only occur after the previous one.
2. For each sign, we know the interval at which it occurs.
3. The first sign occurs at the first multiple of its interval.
4. The second sign occurs at the first multiple of its interval that comes after the year the first sign occurred.
5. This pattern continues for all signs.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases and for each test case, the number of signs and their respective intervals.
2. For each test case, it initializes the year of the first sign's occurrence as `a[0]`.
3. It then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the year of their occurrence based on the year the previous sign occurred.
4. For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula finds the next multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
5. The program stores the result for each test case and prints them all at the end.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the code with the first test case from the example:
- For the first test case: `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - First sign: `3`
  - Second sign: `(3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4` (first multiple of 2 after 3)
  - Third sign: `(4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8` (first multiple of 4 after 4)
  - Fourth sign: `(8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10` (first multiple of 5 after 8)
  - Fifth sign: `(10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18` (first multiple of 9 after 10)
  - Sixth sign: `(18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36` (first multiple of 18 after 18)
- The result for this test case is `36`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen, according to the problem statement and the example provided.
