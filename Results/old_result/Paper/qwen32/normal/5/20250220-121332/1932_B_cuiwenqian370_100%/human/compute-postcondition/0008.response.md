Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, with `data[0]` being a string representation of an integer T such that 1 <= T <= 1000; `index` is 2; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables retain their initial values.
