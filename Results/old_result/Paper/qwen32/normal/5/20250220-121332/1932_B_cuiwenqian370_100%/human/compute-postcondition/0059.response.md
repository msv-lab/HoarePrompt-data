Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the given function signature. However, it is implied that it processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of integers in a list, followed by a list of `n` integers. The function returns a value or performs an action based on the provided integers for each test case.**
