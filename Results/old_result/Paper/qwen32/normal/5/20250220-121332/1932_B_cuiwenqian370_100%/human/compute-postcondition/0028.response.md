Output State: **`t` is unchanged; `results` now includes `str(last_year)` as its last element; `T` must be greater than the current number of iterations; `n` is `int(data[index - n])`; `index` is incremented by `n`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The value of `last_year` is updated to be the first element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
