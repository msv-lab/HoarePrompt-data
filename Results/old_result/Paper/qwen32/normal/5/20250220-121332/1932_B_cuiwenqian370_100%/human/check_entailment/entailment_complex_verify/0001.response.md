### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
1. **Objective**: Determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that each sign appears at regular intervals and the next sign can only occur after the previous one.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - There are `t` test cases.
   - Each test case has `n` signs, each with a specific interval `a_i`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input data at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then parses the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective intervals into a list `a`.

2. **Calculation of Sign Occurrence Years**:
   - The first sign occurs at the first multiple of its interval, which is `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula computes the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program stores the final year for each test case in the `results` list and prints them all at the end.

#### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the code with the first test case from the example:
- For the first test case: `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - First sign: `3`
  - Second sign: `(3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4` (first multiple of 2 after 3)
  - Third sign: `(4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8` (first multiple of 4 after 4)
  - Fourth sign: `(8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10` (first multiple of 5 after 8)
  - Fifth sign: `(10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18` (first multiple of 9 after 10)
  - Sixth sign: `(18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36` (first multiple of 18 after 18)
- The result for this test case is `36`, which matches the expected output.

### Annotations:
The annotations provide a clear state of the program at key points, confirming that the program correctly processes the input and calculates the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the problem description, the code analysis, the verification with the example, and the annotations, the program appears to correctly calculate the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
