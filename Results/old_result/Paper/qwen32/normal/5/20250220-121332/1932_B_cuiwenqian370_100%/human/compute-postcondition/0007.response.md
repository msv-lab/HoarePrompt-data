`n` is assigned the value of the integer conversion of `data[index]`, which means `n` is the integer value of the string at `data[1]`. The values of `t`, `data`, `index`, `T`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, with `data[0]` being a string representation of an integer T such that 1 <= T <= 1000; `index` is 1; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
