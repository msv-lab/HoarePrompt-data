You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()

        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True

                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then determines if the string `c` matches a specific pattern derived from `a` and `b`, and prints "YES" if `c` matches the pattern and "NO" otherwise. The pattern is such that for each position, if `a` and `b` have the same character, `c` must also have the same character; if `a` and `b` differ, `c` must not have the same character as either `a` or `b` at that position.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in the construction of the template and the subsequent checks to determine if the strings `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

Let's break down the problematic part of the code:

```python
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())
```

Here, the template is constructed by appending `a[i]` if `a[i] == b[i]`, and `a[i].upper()` otherwise. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the possibility that `b[i]` might be the correct character to use in the template when `a[i] != b[i]`. 

For example, consider the following test case:

```
1
2
aa
bb
ab
```

For this input:
- The template should be `AB` because `a[0] != b[0]` and `a[1] != b[1]`.
- `a` and `b` should match the template `AB` because:
  - `a[0] == 'a'` and `b[0] == 'b'`, which matches `A` (since `a[0] != 'a'` and `b[0] != 'a'`).
  - `a[1] == 'a'` and `b[1] == 'b'`, which matches `B` (since `a[1] != 'b'` and `b[1] != 'b'`).
- `c` should not match the template `AB` because:
  - `c[0] == 'a'`, which matches `A` (since `c[0] == 'a'`).

However, the code will construct the template as `aa` (since `a[0] == a[0]` and `a[1] == a[1]`), and then it will incorrectly determine that `a` and `b` do not match the template, leading to an incorrect output of `NO`.

To fix this, the code should construct the template by considering both `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `a[i] != b[i]` and choose the character that makes `c[i]` not match the template.

Here's a corrected version of the template construction logic:

```python
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        if c[i] == a[i]:
            template.append(b[i].upper())
        else:
            template.append(a[i].upper())
```

This ensures that the template is constructed in such a way that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.
