Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is incremented by 1; `template`, `match_a_b` remain as per their definitions and values from the previous iteration; `match_c` is False.**

Explanation: The value of `match_c` has been set to `False`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `template`, `match_a_b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
