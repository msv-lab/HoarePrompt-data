Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` and either the second character of `a` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True`; `match_c` is `True`; `i` is 1. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `template` includes the second character of `a`. Otherwise, `template` includes the uppercase version of the second character of `a`.**
