Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values of user input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is 2; `template` is a list containing the first character of `a` (or its uppercase version), the second character of `a` (or its uppercase version if it is not equal to the second character of `b`), and the third character of `a` (or its uppercase version if `a[2]` is not equal to `b[2]`); if `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`, then `template` contains `a[1]` as its second element; if `a[1]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `template` contains the uppercase version of `a[1]` as its second element; if `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, then `match_a_b` remains `True` and `match_c` remains `False`. Otherwise, either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both).**
