Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer greater than 5; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; `i` is 5; `match_a_b` is False.**

In this output state, the variable `match_a_b` has been set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial values.
