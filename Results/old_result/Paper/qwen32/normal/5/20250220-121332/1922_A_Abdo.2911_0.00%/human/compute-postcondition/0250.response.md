The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is incremented by 1; `template` and `match_a_b` remain as per their definitions and values from the previous iteration; `match_c` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
