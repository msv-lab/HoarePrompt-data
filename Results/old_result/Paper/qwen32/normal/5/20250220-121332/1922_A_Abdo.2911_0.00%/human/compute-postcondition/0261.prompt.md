You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:

                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
                ].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that `t` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `True` or `False`; `match_c` is `True` or `False`. The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations, and the final output will have been printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
