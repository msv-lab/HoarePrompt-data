Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; if `a[i]` does not match `template[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is `False` and the current element `template[i]` is lowercase; the internal loop or if statement is broken out of in this case.**
