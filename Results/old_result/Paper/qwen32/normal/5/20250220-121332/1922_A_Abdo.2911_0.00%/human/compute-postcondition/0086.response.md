Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; `match_a_b` is `True` if no conditions within the loop caused it to be set to `False` during any of the `n` iterations. Otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`; `match_c` is `True` if no conditions within the loop caused it to be set to `False` during any of the `n` iterations. Otherwise, `match_c` is `False`; `i` is `n`. If `match_a_b` is `True` and `match_c` is `False`, the condition `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` is true and the if part executes. Otherwise, the else part executes, ensuring that either `match_a_b` is `False` or `match_c` is `True` (or both).**
