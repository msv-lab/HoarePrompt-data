Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 < `t` â‰¤ 999; `n` is greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are string values with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `i` is the index at which the break occurred if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise it remains `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking; `template` is a list containing the characters of `a` up to the `n`-th character, where each character at index `i` is either `a[i]` or the uppercase version of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`; `match_a_b` is `False` if the loop breaks, otherwise it is `True`; `match_c` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `template[i]` is lowercase, otherwise it remains `True`.**
