Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `n` is an input integer greater than 5; `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list of length `n` where each element is either the character from `a` if it matches the character from `b` at the same index, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match; `i` is 5; if `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
