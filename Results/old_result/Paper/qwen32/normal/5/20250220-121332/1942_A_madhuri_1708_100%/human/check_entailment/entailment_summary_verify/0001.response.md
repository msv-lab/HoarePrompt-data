Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the provided function summary.

### Problem Recap:
1. We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. The array elements must satisfy `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
3. If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program processes multiple test cases, each defined by `n` and `k`. Here's how it handles different cases:

#### Case 1: `k >= 2`
- If `n == k`, it outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k` (e.g., `[k, k, ..., k]`). 
  - **Reasoning:** All cyclic shifts of such an array are identical and sorted, so there are exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
- If `n != k`, it outputs `-1`.
  - **Reasoning:** It's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts if `n != k` when `k >= 2`. This is because if `k < n`, there can't be `k` sorted shifts (since all shifts would not be sorted unless all elements are equal, which would make all `n` shifts sorted). If `k > n`, it's also impossible as there can't be more sorted shifts than there are shifts.

#### Case 2: `k == 1`
- It outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
  - **Reasoning:** This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself (the first shift). All other cyclic shifts are not sorted because they start with a larger number and are thus not in non-decreasing order.

### Correctness Check:
- **Case 1 (k >= 2):**
  - When `n == k`, the program correctly outputs an array where all cyclic shifts are sorted.
  - When `n != k`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts under these conditions.
- **Case 2 (k == 1):**
  - The program correctly outputs an array with exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - **k = 0:** The problem description does not specify behavior for `k = 0`, but since `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, this case is not applicable.
  - **k > n:** The program correctly handles this by outputting `-1` when `k > n`.
  - **k = n:** The program correctly handles this by outputting an array where all elements are the same, ensuring all cyclic shifts are sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all specified cases correctly according to the problem description. It correctly identifies when it's impossible to construct the desired array and provides a valid array when possible.

**Correctness:** **True**

Final: **True**
