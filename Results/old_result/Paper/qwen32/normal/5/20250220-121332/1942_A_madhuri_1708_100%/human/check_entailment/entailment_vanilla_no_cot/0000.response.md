Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Let's analyze the logic:

- For `k >= 2`:
  - If `n == k`, it outputs an array where all elements are equal to `k`. This is correct because all cyclic shifts of such an array are identical and sorted.
  - If `n != k`, it outputs `-1`. This is incorrect because there are cases where `n != k` and `k >= 2` where a valid array can still be constructed. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 2, 3, 1]` has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

- For `k == 1`:
  - It outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This is correct because this array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself.

The program needs to handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` more carefully. It should construct an array that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is not equal to `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == 1:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
        elif k == n:
            print(*[k for j in range(k)])
        else:
            # Construct an array with exactly k sorted cyclic shifts
            # We can use the pattern: [1, 2, ..., k, 1, 1, ..., 1] (n-k ones at the end)
            result = list(range(1, k + 1)) + [1] * (n - k)
            print(*result)

func()
```

This version correctly handles all the specified cases.
