Let's analyze the provided program and validate its correctness based on the problem statement and the given execution states.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires constructing an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The conditions are:
- `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.
- Out of the `n` cyclic shifts of `a`, exactly `k` of them should be sorted.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **If `k` is 1**:
   - The program outputs an array where elements are in ascending order from 1 to `n`.
   - This ensures that only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
2. **If `k` is greater than 1**:
   - If `k` equals `n`, the program outputs an array where all elements are the same (specifically, `k` repeated `k` times).
   - This ensures that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If `k` is greater than 1 but not equal to `n`, the program outputs `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

### Validation Against Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1: `n = 2`, `k = 2`**
   - Output: `1 1` (or any other two identical numbers).
   - Cyclic shifts: `[1, 1]` (sorted), `[1, 1]` (sorted).
   - This satisfies the condition of having exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

2. **Test Case 2: `n = 3`, `k = 1`**
   - Output: `1 2 3`.
   - Cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3]` (sorted), `[2, 3, 1]` (not sorted), `[3, 1, 2]` (not sorted).
   - This satisfies the condition of having exactly 1 sorted cyclic shift.

3. **Test Case 3: `n = 3`, `k = 2`**
   - Output: `-1`.
   - It is impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts out of 3 for an array of length 3.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the cases where `k` is 1 and when `k` equals `n`. It also correctly identifies the impossible cases where `k` is greater than 1 but not equal to `n`.

### Final Answer:
Reasoning: The program correctly implements the logic to construct the required array based on the given conditions and handles all edge cases appropriately.
Correctness: **True**
