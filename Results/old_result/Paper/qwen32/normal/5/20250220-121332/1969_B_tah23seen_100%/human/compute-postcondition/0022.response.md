Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's with a length between 2 and 200,000. It returns the cost, which is calculated as the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string that is immediately followed by a '0'.**
