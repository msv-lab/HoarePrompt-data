You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: `s` is the original binary string, `one` is the count of consecutive '1's at the end of the string if it ends with '1's, otherwise `one` is 0, and `cost` is the sum of `(number of consecutive '1's + 1)` for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string that is followed by a '0'.
    return cost
    #The program returns the cost, which is the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string that is followed by a '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `s` and returns the cost, which is calculated as the sum of (number of consecutive '1's + 1) for each segment of consecutive '1's in the string that is immediately followed by a '0'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Let's analyze the code and find a counterexample.

The function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before '0's. However, this approach does not account for the optimal cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

Consider the following counterexample:
Input:
```
1
11010
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```
Explanation of the expected output:
1. Choose substring [3, 5]: `11010` → `11001` (cost = 3)

However, the function `func_1(s)` will calculate the cost as follows:
- It encounters two '1's before the first '0', so it adds `2 + 1 = 3`.
- It encounters another '1' before the second '0', so it adds `1 + 1 = 2`.
- Total cost calculated by the function: `3 + 2 = 5`.

This is incorrect because the optimal way to sort the string is to perform a single operation with a cost of 3.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible binary strings, making it incorrect.
