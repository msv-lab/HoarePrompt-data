The code snippet `cost += one + 1` increases the value of `cost` by the value of `one` plus 1. The values of `s`, `i`, and `one` remain unchanged by this operation. The variable `one` is set to 1 if the previous `i` was '1', otherwise, it remains as it was. If `one` is greater than 0 and the previous `i` was '0', `cost` would have been adjusted accordingly before this line, but this line itself does not change `one`.

Output State: **`s` is a binary string with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `i`, `cost` is adjusted based on the previous `i` and is now increased by `one + 1`, `one` is set to 1 if the previous `i` was '1', otherwise `cost` is adjusted if `one` is greater than 0 and the previous `i` was '0', `one` is greater than 0 if a '1' has been encountered previously.**
