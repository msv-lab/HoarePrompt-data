The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which represents the current character in the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the next character in the string `s` for the next iteration of the loop.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a binary string with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `cost` is adjusted based on the current character `i`.
- `one` is set to 1 if the current character `i` is '1', otherwise `cost` is adjusted if `one` is greater than 0 and the current character `i` is '0'.
- `one` is greater than 0 if a '1' has been encountered previously.

Given that `i` is the current character in the string `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the string.

State: **`s` is a binary string with length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `i`, `cost` is adjusted based on the previous `i`, `one` is set to 1 if the previous `i` was '1', otherwise `cost` is adjusted if `one` is greater than 0 and the previous `i` was '0', `one` is greater than 0 if a '1' has been encountered previously.**

Since the exact value of the next character is not specified, we can only describe the state in terms of the transition to the next character in the string `s`.
