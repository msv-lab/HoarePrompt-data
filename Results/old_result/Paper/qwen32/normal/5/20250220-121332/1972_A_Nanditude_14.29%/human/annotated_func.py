#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case contains three parts: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a list a of length n (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and a list b of length n (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9). The first element of each test case is the integer n, followed by the list a, and then the list b.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. Each inner list in `arr`, which represents a test case, is sorted as a whole (not its individual elements) in reverse order based on lexicographical comparison.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case containing an integer and two lists. It returns the list of test cases sorted in descending order based on lexicographical comparison of each inner list.
