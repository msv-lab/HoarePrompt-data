Output State: **The program returns the list `arr` sorted in descending order. Each inner list in `arr`, which represents a test case, is sorted as a whole (not its individual elements) in reverse order based on lexicographical comparison.**

This means that the outer list `arr` will be rearranged such that the test cases (inner lists) are ordered from the largest to the smallest when compared as lists.
