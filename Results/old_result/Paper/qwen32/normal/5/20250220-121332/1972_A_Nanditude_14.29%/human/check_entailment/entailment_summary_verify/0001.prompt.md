You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop(-1)
            a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case containing an integer and two lists. It returns the list of test cases sorted in descending order based on lexicographical comparison of each inner list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires adjusting the difficulties of the proposed problems (`a`) such that each problem is no more difficult than expected (`b`). This is done by inserting new problems (with difficulties `w`) and removing the most difficult problem after each insertion, ensuring that the list `a` is always sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates through both lists `a` and `b` simultaneously using two pointers `i` and `j`. The goal is to ensure that for each position `i` in `a`, the corresponding element in `b` is at least as large.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program logic:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the number of new problems added.
   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are initialized to 0 to traverse lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists.
   - If the current element in `b` (`b[j]`) is less than the current element in `a` (`a[i]`), it means the expected difficulty is less than the actual difficulty. In this case:
     - The most difficult problem (last element in `a`) is removed.
     - The current element from `b` is inserted at position `i` in `a`.
     - `cnt` is incremented to reflect the addition of a new problem.
     - `j` is incremented to move to the next expected difficulty.
   - If `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, both pointers are incremented to move to the next pair of elements.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, `cnt` contains the minimum number of new problems needed, which is then printed.

### Issues:
- The program attempts to insert elements from `b` into `a` when `b[j] < a[i]`, but it does so incorrectly. It removes the last element of `a` and then tries to insert `b[j]` at position `i`, which is not how the problem specifies the insertion should work.
- The problem specifies that a new problem with difficulty `w` should be added, and then the most difficult problem should be removed. The program does not simulate this process correctly.
- The function `func_1` defined at the end of the program is not used and does not contribute to solving the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Continuously compare the current difficulties in `a` and `b`.
2. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[j]`, insert a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` (or any difficulty less than or equal to `b[j]`), and remove the most difficult problem in `a`.
3. Repeat this process until all elements in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement. Therefore, it is incorrect.
