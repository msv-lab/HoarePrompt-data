Reasoning:  
The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem by iteratively checking if the current problem's difficulty in list `a` exceeds the expected difficulty in list `b`. If it does, it replaces the most difficult problem in `a` with a new problem having the difficulty of the current expected difficulty in `b` and increments the count of new problems proposed. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

The program uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse through the lists `a` and `b` respectively. If `b[j] < a[i]`, it attempts to replace `a[i]` with `b[j]` and increments the count `cnt`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the list `a` remains sorted after the replacement, and more importantly, it does not correctly simulate the process of inserting a new problem and removing the most difficult one.

The correct approach should involve inserting a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` into the list `a`, sorting the list, and then removing the last element (the most difficult one). This process should be repeated until all elements in `a` are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b`.

The function `func_1` defined at the end of the program is not used in the program and does not contribute to the solution.

Given the incorrect logic and the fact that the function `func_1` is not utilized, the program does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
