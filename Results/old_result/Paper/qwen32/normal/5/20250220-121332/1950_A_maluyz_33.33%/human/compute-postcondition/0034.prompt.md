Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer input value, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    elif a == b == c:
        print('NONE')
    elif max(a, b, c) == b:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input. If `a < b < c`, then the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition. Otherwise, if `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, no further changes are made. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal and do not satisfy `a < b < c`, then the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `b` (if `b` is the largest) or one of `a` or `c` (if `b` is not the largest).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `a < b < c`, the condition holds true; otherwise, the condition does not hold true, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged except `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a < b < c`, no additional changes occur. If `a == b == c`, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, no additional changes occur except for the increment of `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
