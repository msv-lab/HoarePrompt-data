Given the initial state, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that are all equal to each other. However, the print statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This print statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. It simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NONE**
