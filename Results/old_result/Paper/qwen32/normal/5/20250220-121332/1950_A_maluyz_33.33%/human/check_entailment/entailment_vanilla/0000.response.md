Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if three digits (a, b, c) form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE".
- A "STAIR" is when a < b < c.
- A "PEAK" is when a < b > c.
- If neither of these conditions is met, it should output "NONE".

### Program Analysis:
1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if it's a "STAIR".
4. It checks if `a == b == c` to determine if it's "NONE". However, this condition is redundant because if `a == b == c`, it doesn't form a "STAIR" or a "PEAK", so it should output "NONE" anyway.
5. It checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` to determine if it's a "PEAK". This condition is correct for identifying a peak because if `b` is the maximum, and `a < b`, then `b > c` must hold true for it to be a "PEAK".
6. If none of the above conditions are met, it outputs "NONE".

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies a "STAIR" when `a < b < c`.
- The program correctly identifies a "PEAK" when `a < b > c` by checking if `b` is the maximum value.
- The redundant check for `a == b == c` is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program since it will output "NONE" in this case anyway.
- The final `else` clause correctly handles all other cases by outputting "NONE".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
