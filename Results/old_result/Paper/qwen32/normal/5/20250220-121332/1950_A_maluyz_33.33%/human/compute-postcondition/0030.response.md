The `print('NONE')` statement will output the string 'NONE' regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`. The value of `i` being `i + 1` does not affect the print statement because it is not used within the print statement.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`.

Output: **NONE**
