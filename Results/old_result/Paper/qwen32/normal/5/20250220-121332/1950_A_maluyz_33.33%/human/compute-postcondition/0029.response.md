Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
2. `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
3. `i` is `i + 1`, but since the initial value of `i` is not specified, it's not relevant to the print statement.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is straightforward and prints the string `'PEAK'`.
- The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'PEAK'`.

### Output:
Output: **PEAK**
