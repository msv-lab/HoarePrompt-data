Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input. It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. Additionally, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal. The maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b` if `b` is the largest, otherwise the maximum value is either `a` or `c`.**
