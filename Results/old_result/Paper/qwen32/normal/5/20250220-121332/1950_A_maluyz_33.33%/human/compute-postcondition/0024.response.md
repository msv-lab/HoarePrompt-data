Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `a < b < c`, the condition holds true; otherwise, the condition does not hold true, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged except `i` is incremented by 1.**
