To determine the output, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer input value where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from the input.
- It is explicitly stated that it is not the case that `a` < `b` < `c`.
- Additionally, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal.
- The maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The value of `'PEAK'` is explicitly provided and does not depend on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the specific values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as long as they satisfy the given conditions.

Output: **PEAK**
