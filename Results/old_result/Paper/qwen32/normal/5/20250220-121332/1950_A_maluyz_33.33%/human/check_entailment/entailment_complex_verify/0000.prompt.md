You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. The variable `i` has been incremented from 0 to `t-1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers read in the final iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three integers, and 'NONE' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary and incorrect because the problem description does not specify a special case for when all three digits are equal. The conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" should be sufficient to cover all cases. Additionally, the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is not sufficient to determine if the digits form a "PEAK" because it does not ensure that `a < b > c`. 

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:
- Input: `1 1 2`
- Expected Output: `NONE`
- Actual Output: `PEAK`

The program incorrectly identifies `1 1 2` as a "PEAK" because `max(1, 1, 2) == 2`, which satisfies the condition `max(a, b, c) == b`. However, it should output "NONE" because `1 1 2` does not satisfy the "PEAK" condition `a < b > c`.

A corrected version of the program should look like this:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version correctly handles all cases as specified in the problem description.
