To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state of `num_tests` so that it is greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not part of the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the loop condition `while num_tests > 0:`, `num_tests` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `num_tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, we need to ensure that it is set to a value greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to make `num_tests` greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `num_tests` must be greater than 0; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**
