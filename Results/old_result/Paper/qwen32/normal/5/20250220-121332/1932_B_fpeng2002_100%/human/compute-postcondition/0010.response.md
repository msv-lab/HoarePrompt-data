The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `nums`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust these variables based on the loop's behavior.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and it remains unchanged.
- `num_tests` is decreased by 1, but it is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and it remains unchanged.
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`, and it remains unchanged.
- `x` is `x + 1`.
- `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, but it is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

Since the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, and `x` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `x` is `x + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be `x + 2` from the value at the start of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `nums` is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`, `x` is `x + 2`, `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`**

However, to be precise and considering the loop head variables only:
State: **`x` is `x + 1`, `nums` is a list of `n` integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`**

So the correct state at the start of the next iteration, considering only the loop head variables, is:
State: **`x` is `x + 1`**
