### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, based on the periodicity of each sign. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs, `n`, and the list of periodicities, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the current year as we progress through the signs.
   - For each sign `i`, the program calculates the next occurrence of the sign after the current `start_year` using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
     This formula ensures that we find the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`. Here's why:
     - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the largest integer `k` such that `k * nums[x] <= start_year`.
     - Adding 1 to this `k` ensures that we get the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` then gives us the actual year.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the final value of `start_year` is the year in which the n-th sign occurs, and this value is printed.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program with the first example provided:

- **Input:**
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```
- **Processing:**
  - Start with `start_year = 0`.
  - First sign (periodicity 3): `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
  - Second sign (periodicity 2): `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
  - Third sign (periodicity 4): `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
  - Fourth sign (periodicity 5): `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
  - Fifth sign (periodicity 9): `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
  - Sixth sign (periodicity 18): `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.
- **Output:**
  ```
  36
  ```

The output matches the expected result, confirming the program's correctness for this test case. Similar verification can be done for the other test cases.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the given periodicities. Thus, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
