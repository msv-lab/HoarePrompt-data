The code snippet updates the value of `start_year` by recalculating it based on its previous value and the value at index `x` in the `nums` list. The variables `num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Given:
- `start_year` was initially calculated as `(nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
- `x` is 2.

The new value of `start_year` is calculated as `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line and must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `((nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, `x` is 2**.
