To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `x` and `len(nums)`.

Here's the loop:
```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if `len(nums)` is greater than 0. The variable `x` is the loop index and will be automatically assigned values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1` by the `range` function. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `num_tests` is 0
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line
- `start_year` is 0
- `x` is `len(nums) - 1` from the original `nums`

The only variables in the loop head that need adjustment are `x` and `len(nums)`. Since `x` is reassigned by the `range` function, we only need to ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than 0.

Here's the adjusted state:
State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line and must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is 0, `x` is 0**
