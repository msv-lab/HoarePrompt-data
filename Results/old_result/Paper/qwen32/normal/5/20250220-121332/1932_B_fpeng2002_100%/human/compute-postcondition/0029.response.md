The code snippet `num_tests -= 1` decrements the value of `num_tests` by 1. Given the initial state where `num_tests` is 1, after executing this line, `num_tests` will be 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `nums`, `start_year`, and `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `nums`, `x` is len(nums) - 1**.
