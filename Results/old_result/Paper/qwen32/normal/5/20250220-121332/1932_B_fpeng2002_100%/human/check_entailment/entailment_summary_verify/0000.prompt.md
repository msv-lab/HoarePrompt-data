You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific year based on the provided integers. The final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the code to understand why it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year by finding the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - This is achieved by the formula: `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - This formula ensures that the next occurrence of the sign is strictly after the previous one.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

The logic correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs as required by the problem statement. Let's verify this with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `6`, `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Calculations:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
    - `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
    - `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - Output: `36`

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `5`, `1 2 3 4 5`
  - Calculations:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
    - `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
    - `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
    - `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5`, `1 1 1 1 1`
  - Calculations:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
    - `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
    - `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
    - `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
    - `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `6`, `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Calculations:
    - `start_year = 0`
    - `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
    - `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
    - `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
    - `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
    - `start_year = (900 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
    - `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - Output: `2012`

The program correctly calculates the year for each test case. There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle based on the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
