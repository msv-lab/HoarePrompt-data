Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `num_tests` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the provided loop and how it modifies the `start_year` variable.

The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list, and for each element, it updates `start_year` using the formula:
\[ \text{start\_year} = \left(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{start\_year}}{\text{nums}[x]} \right\rfloor + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[x] \]

This formula essentially rounds `start_year` up to the nearest multiple of `nums[x]`. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State**: `start_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **First Iteration**: `start_year` becomes `nums[0]` because \(\left(\left\lfloor \frac{0}{\text{nums}[0]} \right\rfloor + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[0] = 1 \times \text{nums}[0] = \text{nums}[0]\).
3. **Second Iteration**: `start_year` becomes the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than or equal to `nums[0]`. This is calculated as \(\left(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{nums}[0]}{\text{nums}[1]} \right\rfloor + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[1]\).
4. **Third Iteration**: `start_year` becomes the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than or equal to the result from the second iteration. This is calculated as \(\left(\left\lfloor \frac{\text{result from second iteration}}{\text{nums}[2]} \right\rfloor + 1\right) \times \text{nums}[2]\).
5. **Continuing this pattern**: After all iterations, `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than or equal to the result from the previous iteration.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than or equal to the result after processing all previous elements in `nums`.

In simpler terms, `start_year` will be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers in the `nums` list.

**Output State**: **`start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `nums`.**

Natural language explanation: After all iterations, `start_year` will be the smallest number that is a multiple of every number in the `nums` list. This is known as the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input line split by spaces, `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in `nums`, `x` is len(nums) - 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line, `start_year` is the least common multiple of all the numbers in `nums`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
