The code modifies the value of `start_year` based on the current value of `nums[x]`. Since `x` is initially 1, the new value of `start_year` will be calculated using `nums[1]`. The new `start_year` will be the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the current `start_year`.

Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input line and must have at least 1 integer, `start_year` is `(nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `x` is 1**
