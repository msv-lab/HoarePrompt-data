Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Understanding the Problem
The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse occurs, given that each sign occurs at regular intervals and must occur sequentially.

### Analysis of the Program
The program follows these steps:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the number of signs `n`.
   - Reads the periodicities of the signs into a list `nums`.
   - Initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - Iterates over each sign's periodicity:
     - Updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign after `start_year`.
     - This is done by computing `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which finds the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - Prints the final `start_year` after processing all signs.

### Verification
Let's verify the program with the given example:

#### Example Input:
```
4
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
1 1 1 1 1
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

#### Example Output:
```
36
5
5
2012
```

- **First Test Case**: 
  - The program calculates the years as follows:
    - `start_year` starts at 0.
    - For the first sign (period 3): `(0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - For the second sign (period 2): `(3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
    - For the third sign (period 4): `(4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
    - For the fourth sign (period 5): `(8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
    - For the fifth sign (period 9): `(10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
    - For the sixth sign (period 18): `(18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
  - The output is `36`, which matches the example.

- **Second Test Case**: 
  - The program calculates the years as follows:
    - `start_year` starts at 0.
    - For the first sign (period 1): `(0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
    - For the second sign (period 2): `(1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
    - For the third sign (period 3): `(2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
    - For the fourth sign (period 4): `(3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
    - For the fifth sign (period 5): `(4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
  - The output is `5`, which matches the example.

- **Third Test Case**: 
  - The program calculates the years as follows:
    - `start_year` starts at 0.
    - For each sign (period 1): `(start_year // 1 + 1) * 1 = start_year + 1`
  - The output is `5`, which matches the example.

- **Fourth Test Case**: 
  - The program calculates the years as follows:
    - `start_year` starts at 0.
    - For the first sign (period 50): `(0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
    - For the second sign (period 30): `(50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
    - For the third sign (period 711): `(60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
    - For the fourth sign (period 200): `(711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 900`
    - For the fifth sign (period 503): `(900 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
    - For the sixth sign (period 1006): `(1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
  - The output is `2012`, which matches the example.

Based on the analysis and verification, the program correctly computes the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**
