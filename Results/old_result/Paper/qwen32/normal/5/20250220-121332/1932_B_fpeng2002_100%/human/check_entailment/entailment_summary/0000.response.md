Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the problem description. The program iterates over the list of periodicities for each test case, updating the `start_year` variable to reflect the year in which the next sign will occur, considering that the next sign can only occur in a year that is a multiple of its periodicity and is strictly after the year the previous sign occurred. 

The key part of the logic is the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which calculates the next year that is a multiple of the current sign's periodicity (`nums[x]`) and is strictly after the current `start_year`. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially as required by the problem statement.

The program processes each test case independently and prints the correct year for each one, as demonstrated by the example provided in the problem description. The execution summary confirms that the program processes all test cases correctly and outputs the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
