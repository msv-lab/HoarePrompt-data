The code snippet `less = []` initializes an empty list named `less`. This operation does not affect the value of `loop` as it is not modified by the code. Therefore, the Output State is `loop` must be greater than 0, and `less` is an empty list.

Output State: **`loop` must be greater than 0; `less` is an empty list**.
