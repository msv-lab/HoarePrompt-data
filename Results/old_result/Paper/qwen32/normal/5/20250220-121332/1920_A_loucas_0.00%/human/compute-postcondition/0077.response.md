Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is 1, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a` twice, and `less` and `no` are lists containing the value of `a` once. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a` twice, and `big` and `no` are lists containing the value of `a` once. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a` twice, and `big` and `less` are lists containing the value of `a` once.**
