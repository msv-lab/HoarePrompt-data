Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`, `big` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 1, `less` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, with the condition that `max(big) < min(less)`. Additionally, `i` is not an element of `no`.**
