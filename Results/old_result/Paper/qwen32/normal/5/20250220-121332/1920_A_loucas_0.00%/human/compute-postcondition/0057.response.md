Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is equal to the previous value of `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `less` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is 1, `a` is an input integer.**

In natural language: The variable `big` now contains the value of `a` as its first element. All other variables retain their previous values.
