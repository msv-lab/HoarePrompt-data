Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. The logic to find the number of valid integers `k` is incorrect. The code only finds the first valid `k` and breaks out of the loop, instead of counting all valid `k` values.
2. The variable `num` is used incorrectly. It is intended to count the number of valid integers `k`, but it is being used to store the value of a single valid `k` instead.
3. The code does not handle the case where there are no valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints correctly. It should print `0` in such cases, but it might print the last value of `i` that was checked.

Here is a corrected version of the code for reference:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        count = 0
        for i in range(max(big), min(less) + 1):
            if i not in no:
                count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version initializes a `count` variable to zero and increments it for each valid `k` found in the range. It also correctly handles the case where no valid `k` exists by printing `0`.
