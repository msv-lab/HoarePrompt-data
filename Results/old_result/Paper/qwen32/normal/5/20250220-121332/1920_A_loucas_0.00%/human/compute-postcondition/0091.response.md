Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`, `big` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 1, `less` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 2, `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `num` is `i + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `loop`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `iterable`, `big`, `less`, `no`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
