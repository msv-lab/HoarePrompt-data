Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `iterable2` is `iterable2 + 1`. If `x` is 1, `less` is an empty list, `big` contains the value of `a` twice if the if block executes, or `big` contains the value of `a` and `no` contains `[a]` if the else block executes. If `x` is 2, `less` contains the value of `a`, `big` contains the value of `a` if the if block executes, or both `big` and `no` contain `[a]` if the else block executes. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, both `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` contains `[a, a]` if the else block executes or remains an empty list if the if block executes.**
