The code snippet `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Given the initial state, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a` based on the value of `x`. After executing the code, `no` will definitely contain the value of `a` as its last element.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 2`, `num` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the new input if `x` is equal to 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the second integer from the new input if `x` is equal to 2, otherwise `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**
