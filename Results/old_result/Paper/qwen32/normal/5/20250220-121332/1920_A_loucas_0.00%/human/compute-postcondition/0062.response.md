The code snippet `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. The other variables' values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is equal to the previous value of `innerLoop`, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, `iterable` is the previous value of `innerLoop + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `x` is not equal to 1, and `x` is not equal to 2.**
