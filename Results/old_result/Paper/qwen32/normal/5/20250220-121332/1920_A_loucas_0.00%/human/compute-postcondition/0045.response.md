Postcondition: **`loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is equal to the number of iterations, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `big` is a list containing at least one element, `less` is a list containing at least one element with a value greater than the maximum value in `big`, and `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2. If `i` is `max(big) + 1` and `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is `max(big) + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `num` remains 0.**
