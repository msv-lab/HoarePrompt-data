Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `num` is 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`, `big` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 1, `less` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2`, with the condition that `max(big) < min(less)`. If `i` is not an element of `no`, then `num` is set to `i` and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is an element of `no`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`, `big` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 1, `less` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 2, `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is greater than 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `iterable` is `innerLoop + 1`, `big` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 1, `less` is a non-empty list of values where `x` was 2, `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is `i + 2`. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is set to `i + 2` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
