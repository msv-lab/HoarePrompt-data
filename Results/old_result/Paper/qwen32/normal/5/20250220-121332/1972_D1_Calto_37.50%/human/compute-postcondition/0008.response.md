To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given Python code snippet with respect to the initial state provided. Here's the breakdown of the code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```
cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
```

Given Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`.
- `y` is `i * i`.

The variables `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code snippet, so they remain as they are. The variable `i` is already defined as `i + 1` in the initial state, so we will use this value for `i` in our calculations.

Let's analyze the right-hand side of the assignment:
- `x // y` is the integer division of `x` by `y`.
- `(i > 1)` is a boolean expression that evaluates to 1 if `i` is greater than 1, and 0 otherwise.

Since `x` is defined as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` is defined as `i * i`, we substitute these into the expression:
- `x // y` becomes `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i)`.
- `(i > 1)` evaluates to 1 if `i > 1`, and 0 if `i <= 1`.

Thus, `cnt` is updated to its previous value plus the integer division of `x` by `y` plus the result of the boolean expression `(i > 1)`.

Given that the initial state specifies that `i` is `i + 1`, we can infer that `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this line of code is executed. Therefore, `i` is at least 2, making `(i > 1)` always evaluate to 1.

Hence, the new value of `cnt` will be:
- `cnt = cnt + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`; `cnt` is `cnt + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + 1`.**
