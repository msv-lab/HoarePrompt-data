Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for given n and m, but the logic within it does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.

The problem requires counting pairs (a, b) such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The provided function `func_2` does not implement this logic. Instead, it seems to be attempting to count pairs based on a different, unrelated formula.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true. This can be done efficiently by using the properties of the gcd and the constraints provided.

Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        m = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        results.append(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads the input, processes each test case, and counts the valid pairs according to the problem's conditions.
