Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`.**

In natural language: `n` and `m` remain the same positive integers with the conditions 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `x` is recalculated as `n - (i * i - i)`. The new variable `y` is assigned the value of `i * i`.
