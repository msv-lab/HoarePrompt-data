Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the following conditions:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

### Issues in the Provided Program
Let's examine the logic in `func_2(n, m)`:
- The function iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) (not \(m\)).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
- It then increments the count by \(x // y + (i > 1)\).

The logic to determine the count of valid pairs is incorrect. It does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, for each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
This implies that \(a\) must be of the form:
\[ a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b \]
for some integer \(k\).

However, a more efficient approach involves iterating over possible values of \(\gcd(a, b)\) and counting valid pairs.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
