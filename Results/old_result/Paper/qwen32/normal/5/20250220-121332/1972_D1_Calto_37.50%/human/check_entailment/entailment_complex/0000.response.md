### Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function 1 (func_1):
- This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. The output of this function is the GCD of the input integers, which is correct.

#### Function 2 (func_2):
- This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
- The function iterates from \(i = 1\) to \(m-1\) and calculates \(x\) and \(y\) based on the formulas \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
- It then updates `cnt` with the expression `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`.
- After the loop, if `cnt` is 0, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

However, there are some issues with the logic in `func_2`:
- The formula used in `func_2` does not directly correspond to the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The condition `if (cnt == 0) : return 1` seems arbitrary and does not align with the problem's logic.
- The overall logic in `func_2` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

Given the provided examples and the expected output, it is clear that `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_2` does not properly calculate the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **False**
