The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those for the next iteration of the loop. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `m` is a constant greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `i_prev + 1`, and `m` remains the same.

Since the task only requires adjusting the state of the objects in the loop head, we don't need to adjust `n`, `m`, `cnt`, `x`, or `y` explicitly in the state description for the next iteration. The values of `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are dependent on the current value of `i` and will be recalculated in the next iteration based on the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` was `i_prev` at the end of the last iteration, it should be `i_prev + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Since we don't have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i + 1` (assuming `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration).

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 1`**
