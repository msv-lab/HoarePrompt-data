You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:

    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: The loop will terminate when `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` will be the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    #
    #In natural language, this means:
    #Output State:
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: `cnt` is `n + sum((n - i*(i-1)) // (i*i) for i in range(2, m)) + (m - 2)`
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is `n + sum((n - i*(i-1)) // (i*i) for i in range(2, m)) + (m - 2)`, and `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt, which is calculated as `n + sum((n - i*(i-1)) // (i*i) for i in range(2, m)) + (m - 2)` and is not equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `m` (both between 1 and 2 * 10^6). It calculates a value `cnt` based on a specific formula involving `n` and `m`. If `cnt` is 0, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the calculated value of `cnt`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the following conditions:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

### Issues in the Provided Program
Let's examine the logic in `func_2(n, m)`:
- The function iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) (not \(m\)).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
- It then increments the count by \(x // y + (i > 1)\).

The logic to determine the count of valid pairs is incorrect. It does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, for each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
This implies that \(a\) must be of the form:
\[ a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b \]
for some integer \(k\).

However, a more efficient approach involves iterating over possible values of \(\gcd(a, b)\) and counting valid pairs.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
