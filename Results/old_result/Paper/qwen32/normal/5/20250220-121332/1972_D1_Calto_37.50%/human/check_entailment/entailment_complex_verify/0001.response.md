### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The annotations confirm that this function returns the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The annotations indicate that the function iterates over \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) (not \(m\)).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments the count by \(x // y + (i > 1)\).

#### Annotations and Code Evaluation:

- The annotations provided do not reflect the actual logic required by the problem.
- The logic in `func_2(n, m)` does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Instead, it uses a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly:
- For each \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), calculate \(g = \gcd(a, b)\).
- Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot g\).
- Count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Provided Program Logic:

- The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.
- The annotations do not reflect a correct understanding of the problem requirements.

#### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in determining that the program is incorrect.
