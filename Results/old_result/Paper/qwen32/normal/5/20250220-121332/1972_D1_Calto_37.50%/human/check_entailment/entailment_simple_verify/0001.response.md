### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description and the provided code in detail, using the annotated version to validate or challenge the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given `n` and `m`.

#### Annotations:
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points:
- `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the GCD of `a` and `b`.
- `func_2(n, m)` iterates from `1` to `m-1` and calculates `x` and `y` for each `i`, then updates the count `cnt` based on these calculations.

#### Issues in `func_2(n, m)`:
The logic in `func_2(n, m)` is incorrect for the following reasons:
1. **Incorrect Iteration Range**: The loop runs from `1` to `m-1`, which means it does not include the case when `b = m`.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula used to update `cnt` does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to check the condition:
\[ a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
This can be simplified to:
\[ a \equiv -b \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \]
This implies that `a` must be of the form:
\[ a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b \]
for some integer `k`.

However, a more efficient approach involves iterating over possible values of \(\gcd(a, b)\) and counting valid pairs.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The annotations confirm that the calculations and logic within `func_2(n, m)` are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
