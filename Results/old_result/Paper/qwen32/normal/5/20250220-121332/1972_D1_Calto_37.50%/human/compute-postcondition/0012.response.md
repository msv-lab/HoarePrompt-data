Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`; `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`**

Natural Language: The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is recalculated as `n - (i * i - i)`. The value of `y` is recalculated as `i * i`. The value of `cnt` is updated by adding the result of `x // y` plus 1 if `i` is greater than 1.
