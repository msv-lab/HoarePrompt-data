The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` has implicitly been incremented by 1 (since it's a common behavior of the `for` loop in Python). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be incremented by 1, and `t` should remain the same.

Given that `_` is a throwaway variable (commonly used when the loop variable is not needed), we can just consider the iteration count. At the start of the next iteration, `_` would naturally be the next integer in the sequence, and `t` would remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is a 4xN list of integers; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`**. 

Since the loop variable `_` is incremented automatically, we don't need to explicitly adjust it in the state description. The important part is that `t` remains the same, and the loop will execute as long as the current iteration count (implied by `_`) is less than `t`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is essentially the same, except that the loop variable `_` has moved to the next value in the range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is a 4xN list of integers; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`**.
