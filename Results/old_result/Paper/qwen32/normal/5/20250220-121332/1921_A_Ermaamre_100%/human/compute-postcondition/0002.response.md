The code reads four lines of input, each line consisting of space-separated integers, and stores these integers in a 2D list `a` with dimensions 4xN, where N is the number of integers in each line. The value of `t` is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is a 4xN list of integers, where each element in `a` is an integer read from the input.**
