Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `t` is 0; `a` is a 4xN list of integers read from the input in the last iteration; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a` from the last iteration; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x` from the last iteration.**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing all of its iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` implicitly through each iteration. The variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `a` will be the last set of coordinates read from the input, `x` will be the list of x-coordinates from `a`, and `dx` will be the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
