The provided code snippet reads 4 lines of input, each containing N integers, and updates the variable `a` to be a 4xN list of these integers. The variables `x` and `dx` are not directly affected by this code snippet and will retain their initial values unless further modified later in the program.

Given that `a` is initially a 4xN list of integers, the code will overwrite this initial value of `a` with the new input values. The values of `t`, `x`, and `dx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is a new 4xN list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in the original `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`.**
