In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The state of `t` determines whether the loop will execute.

Given the state before the loop starts is `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, the loop will definitely execute because `t` is guaranteed to be at least 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute. The state of `t` already ensures that the loop will run at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
