Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the area of the square based on the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the corners. However, this approach does not account for the y-coordinates, which are also necessary to determine the side length of the square. The side length of the square can be determined by either the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates, but the program only considers the x-coordinates.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5
```
The correct area of the square is 9 (side length of 3), but the program will output 9 based on the x-coordinates, which is correct in this case. However, consider another input:
```
1
1 2
1 4
4 2
4 4
```
The correct area of the square is 9 (side length of 3), but the program will output 9 based on the x-coordinates, which is correct in this case as well. However, if we have:
```
1
1 1
1 5
5 1
5 3
```
The correct area of the square is 16 (side length of 4), but the program will output 16 based on the x-coordinates, which is incorrect because the y-coordinates indicate that the side length should be 4, not 2.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle cases where the side length is determined by the y-coordinates rather than the x-coordinates. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
