Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is a new 4xN list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in the original `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`.**

Explanation: The value of `dx` is updated to be the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `x`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
