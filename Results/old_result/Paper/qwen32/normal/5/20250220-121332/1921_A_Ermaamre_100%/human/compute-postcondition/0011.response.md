The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a conventional throwaway variable indicating the number of iterations. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not need to be adjusted. However, `t` needs to be decremented by 1 for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99; `a` is a new 4xN list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the N sublists in the original `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `x`.**
