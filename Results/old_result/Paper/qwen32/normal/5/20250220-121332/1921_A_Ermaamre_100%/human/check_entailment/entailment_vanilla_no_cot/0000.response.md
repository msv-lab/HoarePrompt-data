Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the area of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and then squaring that value. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for the y-coordinates and assumes that the side length of the square is the difference in the x-coordinates, which is only true if the square is aligned in a specific way. 

To correctly find the area of the square, you should calculate the differences between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the maximum and minimum y-coordinates. The side length of the square will be the maximum of these two differences. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        y = [p[1] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        dy = max(y) - min(y)
        side_length = max(dx, dy)
        print(side_length * side_length)

func()
```

This version correctly calculates the side length of the square by considering both the x and y coordinates.
