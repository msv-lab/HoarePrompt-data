To determine the state adjustments needed for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. 

Given the initial states:
- `low` is `0`
- `high` is `n`
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`
- `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`
- `st` is an empty set

The loop condition `low + 1 < high` must be true for the loop to execute. 

Step-by-step reasoning:
- `low` is initially `0`.
- `high` is initially `n`.

For the condition `low + 1 < high` to be true:
- `0 + 1 < n` must be true.
- This simplifies to `1 < n`.

Therefore, `n` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute at least once.

No other variables in the loop condition (`low` and `high`) need to be adjusted because:
- `low` is already `0`.
- `high` is `n`, and we only need to ensure `n` is greater than `1`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than `1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set**
