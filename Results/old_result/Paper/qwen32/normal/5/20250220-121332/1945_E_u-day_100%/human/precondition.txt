The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), where n is the length of the permutation and x is the number to be found. The next line contains a permutation p of length n, consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of the values of n for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
