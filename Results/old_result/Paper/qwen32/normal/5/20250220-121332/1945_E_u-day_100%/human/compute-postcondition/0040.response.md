The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of `low`, `high`, `st`, `pos`, `arr`, `n`, `k`, or `arr[low]`.

Here's the reasoning:
- The `print` statement is explicitly given as `print(1)`.
- This means that the value to be printed is directly specified as `1`.
- None of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state (`low`, `high`, `st`, `pos`, `arr`, `n`, `k`, `arr[low]`) are used in this `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output will be the number `1`.

Output: **1**
