To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables `low` and `high` which are part of the loop condition `low + 1 < high`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`.
- `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `st` is a set containing `mid`, where `mid` is `n // 2`.
- If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `low` is `0` and `high` is `n // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`.

The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must hold true.

Let's consider the two possible scenarios for `low` and `high`:

1. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`:
   - `low` is `0`.
   - `high` is `n // 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, we need `0 + 1 < n // 2`, which simplifies to `1 < n // 2`. This means `n` must be greater than 2.

2. If `arr[mid]` is not greater than `k`:
   - `low` is `n // 2`.
   - `high` is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, we need `n // 2 + 1 < n`. This inequality is always true as long as `n` is greater than 1.

Since the initial condition given is `n` must be greater than 1, the second scenario is always valid. However, to ensure that the first scenario also allows the loop to execute, we need `n` to be greater than 2.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 2 to cover both scenarios.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, then `low` is `0` and `high` is `n // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `n`.**
