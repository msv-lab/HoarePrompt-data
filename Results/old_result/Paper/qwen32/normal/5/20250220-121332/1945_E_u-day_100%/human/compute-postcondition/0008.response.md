The code snippet `pos = i` directly assigns the value of `i` to `pos`. This means `pos` will now hold the same value as `i`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and the condition `i + 1` being less than `n` remain unchanged. The variable `i` itself is not modified in this snippet, and it will still be `i + 1` as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
