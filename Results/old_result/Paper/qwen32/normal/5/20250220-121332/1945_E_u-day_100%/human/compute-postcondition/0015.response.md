The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty set named `st`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set.**
