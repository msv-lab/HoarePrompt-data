The code snippet `high = mid` updates the value of `high` to be equal to the value of `mid`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2` and is included in the set `st`. Since `high` is updated to `mid`, the new value of `high` will be `(low + high) // 2`.

Other variables such as `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, and `st` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `st` is a set containing `(low + high) // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is `(low + high) // 2`**.
