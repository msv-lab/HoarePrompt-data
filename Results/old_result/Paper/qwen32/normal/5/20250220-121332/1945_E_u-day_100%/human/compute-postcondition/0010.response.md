The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1` and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `k` and `arr` are the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively. If `arr[i + 1] == k`, `pos` is set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, `pos` remains -1 or retains its previous value if it was already set. `i` is `i + 1`**
