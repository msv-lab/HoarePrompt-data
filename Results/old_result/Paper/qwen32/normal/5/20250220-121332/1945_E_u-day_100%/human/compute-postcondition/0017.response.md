The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between `low` and `high` using integer division. Given that `low` is `0` and `high` is `n`, the midpoint `mid` will be `(0 + n) // 2`, which simplifies to `n // 2`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the value returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is `0`, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set, `mid` is `n // 2`.**
