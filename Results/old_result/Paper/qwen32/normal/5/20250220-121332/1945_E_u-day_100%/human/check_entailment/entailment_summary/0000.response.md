Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by identifying the position of the number `x` in the permutation and then performing a binary search to determine if the number `x` can be found at the position indicated by the binary search (`low`). However, the code does not fully address the problem requirements.

The problem states that we can perform up to 2 swaps to arrange the permutation such that after performing the binary search, the element at position `l` (which will be `low` after the binary search) is equal to `x`. The current implementation only performs a single swap if necessary and does not consider the possibility of making a second swap to achieve the desired result.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. The code correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation (`pos`).
2. It then performs a binary search to find a position `low`.
3. If `arr[low]` is not equal to `x`, it performs a single swap between `low` and `pos`.

However, the code does not explore the possibility of making a second swap to further align the permutation with the binary search result. The problem guarantees that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the current implementation only attempts 1 swap.

To be fully correct, the code should consider all possible pairs of swaps that could align the permutation such that `arr[low]` equals `x` after the binary search.

Correctness: **False**
