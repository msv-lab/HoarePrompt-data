The code snippet provided assigns the values returned by `func_1()` to `n` and `k`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers and `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation, we need to consider the new values assigned to `n` and `k` by `func_1()`.

Given that `func_1()` is not defined in the provided context, we will assume it returns a tuple of two positive integers where the first integer is the length of the permutation and the second integer is a number within the range of 1 to the first integer.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k` returned by `func_1()`, while `arr` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of length `n`, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly once.**
