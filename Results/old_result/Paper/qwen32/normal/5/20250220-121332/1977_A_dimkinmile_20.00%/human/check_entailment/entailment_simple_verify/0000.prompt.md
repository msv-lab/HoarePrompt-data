You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is less than `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The current implementation only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and outputs "Yes" in that case. However, it does not account for the possibility that `m` could be greater than `n`, which would require more moves to remove cubes than are available, or the scenario where `n` is odd and `m` is 0 (since Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time).

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. According to the problem description, it is impossible to have a tower with 4 cubes after 2 moves because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is 2. The current program would output "Yes" for this case, which is incorrect.

Another example is `n = 3` and `m = 0`. The program would output "No" for this case, even though it is possible to have 0 cubes after 3 moves by removing 3 cubes from an initial tower of 3 cubes.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if `m` is within the range `[0, n]` and if `n - m` is even (since each pair of moves can either add 2 cubes, remove 2 cubes, or leave the number of cubes unchanged).

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if 0 <= m <= n and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```
