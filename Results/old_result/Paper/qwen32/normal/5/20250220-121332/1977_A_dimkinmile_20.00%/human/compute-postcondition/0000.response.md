The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means that after the execution, `n` and `m` will hold the specific values provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are the integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.**
