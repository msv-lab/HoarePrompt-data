Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect based on the problem description. The logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The current implementation checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes) and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". However, this logic does not correctly determine whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider that each move can either add or remove one cube. Therefore, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible to reach exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. This is because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change, and if the difference is odd, it is impossible to reach the exact number of cubes with the given moves.

For example:
- In the first test case (`n = 3`, `m = 3`), it is possible to add 3 cubes, resulting in "Yes".
- In the second test case (`n = 2`, `m = 4`), it is impossible to reach exactly 4 cubes with 2 moves, resulting in "No".
- In the third test case (`n = 5`, `m = 3`), it is possible to add 3 cubes and remove 2 cubes, resulting in "Yes".

The correct logic should check if `abs(n - m)` is even, which would indicate that it is possible to reach exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Correctness: **False**
