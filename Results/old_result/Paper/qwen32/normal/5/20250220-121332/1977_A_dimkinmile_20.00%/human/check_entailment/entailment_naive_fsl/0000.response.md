Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if it is possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The current implementation only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and outputs "Yes" in that case. However, it does not account for the possibility that `m` could be greater than `n`, which would require more moves to remove cubes than are available, or the scenario where `n` is odd and `m` is 0 (since Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time).

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. According to the problem description, it is impossible to have a tower with 4 cubes after 2 moves because the maximum number of cubes that can be added is 2. The current program would output "Yes" for this case, which is incorrect.

Another example is `n = 3` and `m = 0`. The program would output "No" for this case, even though it is possible to have 0 cubes after 3 moves by removing 3 cubes from an initial tower of 3 cubes.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if `m` is within the range `[0, n]` and if `n - m` is even (since each pair of moves can either add 2 cubes, remove 2 cubes, or leave the number of cubes unchanged).

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if 0 <= m <= n and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```
