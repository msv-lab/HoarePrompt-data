You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is less than `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It likely performs some operation based on predefined values or user input within its body, and returns a result. Specifically, given `t` test cases where each test case consists of integers `n` and `m` (with constraints 1 <= n, m <= 100), the function returns a result for each test case. However, without specific details on the operations performed, the exact nature of the return value for each case is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
