The code snippet initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases, is not modified by this code. Therefore, the output state remains with `t` holding its initial value and `buffer` being an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `buffer` is an empty list.**
