Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is the current value of i plus 1, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the list `q` will have counts of each integer in the list `w` at the corresponding index. All other variables (`t`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, and `i`) remain in their initial states except for `q`, which now reflects the frequency of each integer in `w`.
