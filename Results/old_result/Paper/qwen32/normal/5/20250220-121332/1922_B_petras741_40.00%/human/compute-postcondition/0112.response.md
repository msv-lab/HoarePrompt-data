Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input. If `n` is less than 3, `i` is incremented by 1, and other variables (`q`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, `res`) are unchanged or not defined. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is incremented by 1 if `n` was less than 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with the element at index `w[j]` incremented by `n` for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all `j` (0 ≤ j ≤ n) where `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` and `res` is the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for all `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`. `j` is `n + 1` if `eta_ln` is 1, and `j` is `eta_ln - 1` if `eta_ln - 1` is less than or equal to 1000; otherwise, `j` is 1000.**
