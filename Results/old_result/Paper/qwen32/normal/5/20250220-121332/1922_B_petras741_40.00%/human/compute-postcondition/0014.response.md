Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer with a value greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times `i` appears in the list `w`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `q` will be a list where each index corresponds to a value from the list `w`, and the value at each index in `q` will indicate how many times that particular value appeared in `w`. The variables `t`, `buffer`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
