Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `i` is `i + 1` if `n` was less than 3, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with the element at index `w[j]` incremented by `n` for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing the element 0 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. If `q[j] > 0`, `eta` contains the elements 0 and 1. Otherwise, `eta` contains only the element 0. `eta_ln`, `rho`, and `res` are unchanged or not defined if `n` is less than 3.**
