The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n + 1`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is a non-negative integer. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1.

The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is part of the loop range and does not get modified within the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers with length `n`, `i` is the current value of i plus 1, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` remains an empty list, and `j` is 1**.
