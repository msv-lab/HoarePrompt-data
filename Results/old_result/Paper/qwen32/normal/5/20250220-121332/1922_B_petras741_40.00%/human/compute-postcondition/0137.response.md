The code snippet `eta_ln = len(eta)` calculates the length of the list `eta` and assigns it to the variable `eta_ln`. The list `eta` contains all the unique values from `w` that have a count greater than 0. The values of `t`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `i`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is a non-negative integer, `w` is a list of integers with length `n`, `i` is the current value of i plus 1, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]` in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all the unique values from `w` that have a count greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`.**
