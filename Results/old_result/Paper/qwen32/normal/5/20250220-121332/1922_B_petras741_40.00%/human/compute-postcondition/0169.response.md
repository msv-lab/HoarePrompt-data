Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of sticks and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each integer represents the exponent of 2 for the length of the i-th stick. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in the given details.**
