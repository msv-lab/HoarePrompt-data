The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. Given that `index` was initially 2 and `n` is `int(data[1])`, the new value of `index` will be `2 + int(data[1])`. The other variables (`array`, `data`, `t`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `index` is `2 + int(data[1])`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`.**
