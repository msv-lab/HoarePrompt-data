### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the problem statement, the provided code, and the annotations.

**Problem Statement Recap:**
- We need to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- The strategy to maximize this beauty is to sort the array in ascending order and then compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

**Program Analysis:**

1. **Function `func_1(array)`:**
   - The function sorts the input array.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The annotations confirm that `array` is sorted and `beauty` is computed as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements, the elements themselves, and then calls `func_1` to compute the beauty.
   - The results are stored and printed after processing all test cases.
   - The annotations confirm the state transitions and the correct handling of input and output.

**Key Points to Validate:**

- **Sorting the Array:** Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which aligns with the strategy to maximize beauty.
- **Beauty Calculation:** The beauty is correctly computed as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:** The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by reading input, computing results, and storing them before printing.

**Conclusion:**
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then computing the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The annotations provide a clear and consistent explanation of the program's behavior, further validating the correctness of the program.
