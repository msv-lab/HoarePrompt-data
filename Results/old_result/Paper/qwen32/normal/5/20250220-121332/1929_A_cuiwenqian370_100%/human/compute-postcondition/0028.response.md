To determine the output of the `print(result)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

1. **Data and Index Calculation**:
   - `data` is a list of strings.
   - `int(data[0])` must be greater than 0. Let's denote this value as `m`.
   - `t` is initialized to 0.
   - `index` is calculated as `1 + sum(int(data[i]) for i in range(1, 1 + 3*m) if i % (int(data[i]) + 1) == 1)`.

2. **Array and n Calculation**:
   - `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`.
   - `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - `results` is a list containing `m` elements, each being the output of `func_1(array)` for the corresponding iteration.
   - `result` is the output of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration, which is the same as `results[-1]`.

Given the complexity of the calculations and the fact that the exact values of `data` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, we can describe the value of `result` based on the given information.

The `result` is the output of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration, where `array` is a sublist of `data` starting from `index` and containing `n` elements. The value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the specific values in `array`.

Output: **result (where result is the output of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration, with `array` being a sublist of `data` starting from `index` and containing `n` elements)**
