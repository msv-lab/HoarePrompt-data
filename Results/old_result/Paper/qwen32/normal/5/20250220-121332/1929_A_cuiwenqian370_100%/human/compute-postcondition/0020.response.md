The value of `n` is reassigned to the integer value of `data[index]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is 1; `index` is `3 + int(data[1]) + n`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being `result` and the second being the newly appended `result`; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**.
