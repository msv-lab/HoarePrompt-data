The code snippet simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `index`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100), and each integer `a_i` in the array satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input`; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`; `index` is 1.**
