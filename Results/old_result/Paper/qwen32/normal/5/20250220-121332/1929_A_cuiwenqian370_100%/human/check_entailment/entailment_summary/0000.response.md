### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements when the array is optimally rearranged. The provided code consists of two functions:

1. **`func_1(array)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Computes the beauty of an array by sorting it and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Execution Summary**: Sorts the input array and calculates the beauty as described. This function is correctly implemented to achieve the desired result for a single test case.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles multiple test cases by reading input, processing each test case using `func_1`, and printing the results.
   - **Execution Summary**: Reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads the array length and elements, computes the beauty using `func_1`, and stores the result. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty. This is because the largest possible differences occur when the smallest element is followed by the next smallest, and so on.
  
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the input, parsing the number of test cases, and then iterating through each test case to compute and store the beauty. Finally, it prints all the results.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements. It also correctly handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
