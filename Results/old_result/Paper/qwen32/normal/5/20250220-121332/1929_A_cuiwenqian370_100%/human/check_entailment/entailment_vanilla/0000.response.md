Reasoning:
The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of the array. To maximize this sum, we need to arrange the elements of the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

One way to achieve this is by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized compared to any other arrangement. This is because the smallest element will be at the start, and the largest will be at the end, thus maximizing the absolute difference.

Let's analyze the given program:
- `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, this function correctly calculates the maximum beauty.
- `func_2()`: This function handles input reading and output writing. It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements, calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty, and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

The logic in both functions is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
