### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements of the array. To maximize this sum, a key insight is to arrange the elements of the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. 

The original assessment suggests that sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements will maximize the beauty. However, this reasoning is not entirely accurate. Sorting the array in ascending order does not necessarily maximize the beauty. Instead, to maximize the beauty, we should arrange the elements in an alternating max-min pattern (i.e., largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.). This arrangement ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Let's analyze the given program:
- `func_1(array)`: This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, this function does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty. It calculates the beauty of a sorted array, which is not the maximum possible beauty.
- `func_2()`: This function handles input reading and output writing. It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements, calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty, and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results. Given that `func_1` does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty, `func_2` also does not provide the correct results.

The logic in both functions is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the correct strategy to maximize the beauty of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
