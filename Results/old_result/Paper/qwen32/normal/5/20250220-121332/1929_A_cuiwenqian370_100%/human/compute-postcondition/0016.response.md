Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the previous `t` minus 1; `index` is `3 + int(data[1]) + n`; `results` is a list containing one element which is `result`; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**

In simple terms, the value of `index` has been updated by adding `n` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
