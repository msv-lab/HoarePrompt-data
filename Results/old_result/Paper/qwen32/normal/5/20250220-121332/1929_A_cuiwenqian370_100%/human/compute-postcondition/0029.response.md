In the given for loop, the loop iterates over `results`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `result`. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `results` to iterate over. Since the loop body is omitted, we only need to adjust `result` to reflect the next element in `results`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings where `int(data[0])` must be greater than 0
- `t` is 0
- `index` is calculated based on a specific formula involving `data`
- `results` is a list containing `int(data[0])` elements, each being the output of `func_1(array)` for the corresponding iteration
- `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`
- `result` is the output of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration

Since the loop iterates over `results`, the next state should reflect the next element in `results`. Assuming the previous iteration used the `i`-th element of `results`, the next iteration will use the `(i+1)`-th element.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `int(data[0])` must be greater than 0; `t` is 0; `index` is `1 + sum(int(data[i]) for i in range(1, 1 + 3*int(data[0])) if i % (int(data[i]) + 1) == 1); `results` is a list containing `int(data[0])` elements, each being the output of `func_1(array)` for the corresponding iteration; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)` for the next iteration in `results`**
