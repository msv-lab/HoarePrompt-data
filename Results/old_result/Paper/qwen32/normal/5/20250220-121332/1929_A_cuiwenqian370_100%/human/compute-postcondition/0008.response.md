The code snippet takes a slice of the `data` list starting from the position `index` up to `index + n`, converts each element in this slice to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `array`. Since `index` is 2, the slice taken from `data` will start from `data[2]` up to `data[2 + n]`. After this operation, `array` will be a list of integers derived from the elements in `data` from the specified range.

The values of `data`, `t`, `index`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`.**
