The only variable in the loop head is `result`. The loop iterates over `results`, so for the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. 

Let's break down the dependencies:
- `results` is a list containing `int(data[0])` elements.
- For `results` to have at least one element, `int(data[0])` must be greater than 0.

Since the loop body is omitted, we do not need to consider the state of `result` itself before the loop starts, but we need to ensure that `results` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `int(data[0])` is greater than 0.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings where `int(data[0])` must be greater than 0; `t` is 0; `index` is `1 + sum(int(data[i]) for i in range(1, 1 + 3*int(data[0])) if i % (int(data[i]) + 1) == 1); `results` is a list containing `int(data[0])` elements, each being the output of `func_1(array)` for the corresponding iteration; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.**
