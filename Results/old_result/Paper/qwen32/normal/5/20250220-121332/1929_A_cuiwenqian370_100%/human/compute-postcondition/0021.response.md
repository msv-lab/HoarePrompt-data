The code increments the value of `index` by 1. This change impacts the value of `index` but does not affect the values of other variables. The values of `array`, `data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is 1; `index` is `4 + int(data[1]) + n`; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being `result` and the second being the newly appended `result`; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[index - 1])`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**.
