Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100), and each integer `a_i` in the array satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` such that `data[0]` can be converted to an integer `t` which must be greater than 0; `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])` and `t` must be greater than 0; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`.**

In simple terms, the variable `n` has been assigned the integer value of `data[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
