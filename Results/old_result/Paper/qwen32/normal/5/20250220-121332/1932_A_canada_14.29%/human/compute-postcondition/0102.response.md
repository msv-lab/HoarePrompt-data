Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 3 if the current character `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*'; `i` is the next character in the list `s` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
