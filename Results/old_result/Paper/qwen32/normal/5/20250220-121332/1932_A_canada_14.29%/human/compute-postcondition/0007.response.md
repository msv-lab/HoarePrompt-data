The code snippet provided is:

```python
thorn = 0
```

This line of code sets the variable `thorn` to 0. No other variables are affected by this code. The initial state specifies that `thorn` was 0, so setting it to 0 again does not change its value. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0; the current character `i` is '@'**.
