Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters; `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is increased by 1 and `thorn` is set to 0. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` reaches 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is set to 0.**
