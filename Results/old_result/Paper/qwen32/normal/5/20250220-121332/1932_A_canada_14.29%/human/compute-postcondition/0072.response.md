The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `t`, `len`, `s`, `i`, and `thorn` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `thorn` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
