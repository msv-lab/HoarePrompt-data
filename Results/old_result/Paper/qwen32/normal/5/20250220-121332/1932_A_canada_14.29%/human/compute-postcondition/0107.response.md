The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which represents the next character in the list `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and how it will change.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `len` is the integer input by the user
- `s` is a non-empty list of characters
- `ret` is either 1 or 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0
- `thorn` is 3 if the current character `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', `thorn` remains 2 if `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, and remains 0 if `i` is not '@' and not '*'
- `i` is the next character in the list `s`

Since `i` is the next character in the list `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in the list after the current `i`.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in the list `s` as `index`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `s[index]`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `s[index + 1]`.

We do not need to adjust `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, or `thorn` because they are not part of the loop head. The only variable we need to adjust is `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the integer input by the user, `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `ret` is either 1 or 2 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 3 if the current character `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, otherwise `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', `thorn` remains 2 if `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, and remains 0 if `i` is not '@' and not '*', `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`**
