The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable iterating over the list `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the current character being processed in the list `s`. For the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the list `s`. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn` are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.
2. `i` is the loop variable and should be updated to the next character in the list `s`.

Since the loop iterates over `s`, after processing the current character `i`, the next character in `s` should be assigned to `i` for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a non-empty list of characters; `ret` is 1 if the current character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 2 if the current character `i` is '*' and `thorn` was 2 before, otherwise `thorn` remains 0 if `i` is not '@' and not '*'; `i` is the next character in the list `s`**
