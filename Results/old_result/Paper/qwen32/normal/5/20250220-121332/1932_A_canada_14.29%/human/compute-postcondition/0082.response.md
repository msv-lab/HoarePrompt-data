The code snippet resets the variable `ret` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, and `thorn`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the integer input by the user; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0 if the loop completes without encountering two consecutive '*' characters, or 2 if the loop breaks due to two consecutive '*' characters.**
