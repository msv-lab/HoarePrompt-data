Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the integer input by the user, `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the current `i`. If the current character `i` is '@', `ret` is either 2 or 3, and `thorn` is 0. If the current character `i` is '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1, set to 3 if `thorn` was 2 before, and remains 2 if `thorn` was 2 before; otherwise, `thorn` remains 0. If `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the current character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` is 0 and `thorn` remains 0.**
