The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. Since `thorn` was either 0 or 2, after incrementing, `thorn` will be either 1 or 3. The values of the other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `i`, `ret`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is either 1 or 3**.
