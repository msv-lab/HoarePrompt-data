The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next character in the list `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `len` is the input integer
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character
- `i` is the next character in the list `s`

Since `i` is the current character being processed, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the list `s`.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in `s` as `current_index`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `s[current_index]`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `s[current_index + 1]`.

However, we do not have the exact value of `current_index` in the provided state. We only know that `i` is the next character in the list `s`. Since the loop iterates over `s`, the next value of `i` will be the subsequent character in the list.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.

Since we do not have more specific information about the current position of `i` in `s`, we can only express the state in terms of `i` being the next character in the list `s`.
