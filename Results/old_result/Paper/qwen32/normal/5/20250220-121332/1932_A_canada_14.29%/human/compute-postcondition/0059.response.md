The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it iterates over the list `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted in this context.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current character in the list `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next character in the list `s`.

Given the state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `len` is the input integer
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character
- If the current character `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. Otherwise, `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is either 0 or 2. If `i` equals '*', `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` was 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.

Since `i` is the current character, for the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the list `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `i` is the next character in the list `s`; `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is either 0 or 2**.

Note: The values of `ret` and `thorn` are not determined by the loop head and thus remain as described by the conditions given in the problem statement.
