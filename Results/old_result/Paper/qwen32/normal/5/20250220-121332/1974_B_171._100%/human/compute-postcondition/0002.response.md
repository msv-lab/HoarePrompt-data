The code snippet calculates the length of the `unique_chars` list and assigns it to the variable `len_unique`. The values of `encoded` and `char_map` are not altered by this code snippet.

Since `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded`, the length of this list (`len_unique`) is simply the count of these unique characters.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.**
