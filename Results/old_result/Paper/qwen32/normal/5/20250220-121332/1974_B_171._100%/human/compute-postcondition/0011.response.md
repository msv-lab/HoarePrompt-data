Output State: **The program returns the string `decoded`, which is formed by mapping each character in the strings within `encoded` using `char_map`.**

This means that each character in the strings contained in the `encoded` list has been replaced by its corresponding character from the end of the `unique_chars` list according to the `char_map` dictionary. The final result is a single concatenated string `decoded`.
