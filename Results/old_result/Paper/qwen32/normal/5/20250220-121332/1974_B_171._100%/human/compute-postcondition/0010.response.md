The provided code snippet attempts to decode a list of encoded strings using a character mapping defined by `char_map`. However, there is a logical error in the provided code because `encoded` is a list of tuples, and the code tries to iterate over `encoded` as if it were a single string.

Assuming the intention was to decode each string within the tuples in `encoded`, the correct approach would be to iterate over each tuple and then over each character in the string within the tuple. Since the code as given will not execute as intended, let's assume a corrected version where we decode each string in the tuples.

Here's the corrected interpretation and the resulting output state:

Corrected Code Interpretation:
```python
decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for tup in encoded for ch in tup[1])
```

This corrected code iterates over each tuple in `encoded`, then over each character in the string (second element of the tuple), and maps each character using `char_map`.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded` and must have at least one element; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `len_unique`; `decoded` is a string formed by mapping each character in the strings within `encoded` using `char_map`.**

In simpler terms, `decoded` is a new string where each character from the strings in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character from `char_map`. All other variables remain unchanged.
