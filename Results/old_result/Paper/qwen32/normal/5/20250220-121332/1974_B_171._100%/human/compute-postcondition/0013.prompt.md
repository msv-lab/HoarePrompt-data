You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: `encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded` and must have at least one element; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `len_unique`. `char_map` is fully populated such that the first character in `unique_chars` maps to the last character in `unique_chars`, the second character maps to the second-to-last character, and so on.`
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is formed by mapping each character in the strings within `encoded` using `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n`, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns the string `decoded`, which is formed by mapping each character in the strings within `encoded` using `char_map`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `decoded`, which is formed by mapping each character in the strings within `encoded` using `char_map`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
