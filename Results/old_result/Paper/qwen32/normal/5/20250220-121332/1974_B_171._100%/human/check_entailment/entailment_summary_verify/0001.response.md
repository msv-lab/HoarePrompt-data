### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The encoding process involves creating a string `r` from the distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically.
   - Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to:
     - Identify the unique characters in the encoded string `b`.
     - Sort these characters to form `r`.
     - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.
     - Replace each character in `b` using this mapping to reconstruct the original string `s`.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - The code reads the input and processes each test case using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function:
     - Identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
     - Constructs a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.
     - Replaces each character in `b` using this mapping to form the decoded string.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - For the encoded string "serofedsoc":
     - The unique characters are "cdefors", sorted alphabetically.
     - The mapping is: c -> s, d -> r, e -> o, f -> e, o -> e, r -> d, s -> c.
     - Applying this mapping to "serofedsoc" gives "codeforces", which is correct.

5. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary provided does not match the actual implementation of `func_1`. The summary incorrectly states that the function takes a list of tuples as input, whereas the actual implementation takes a single string `b`.
   - The summary also incorrectly describes the input format. The actual function processes a single encoded string `b` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Despite the discrepancy in the function summary, the implementation of `func_1` is correct. It accurately reconstructs the original string `s` from the encoded string `b` for each test case.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
