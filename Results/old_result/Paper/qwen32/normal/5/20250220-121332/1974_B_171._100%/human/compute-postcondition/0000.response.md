The code snippet creates a set of unique characters from all the strings in the list of tuples `encoded`, sorts these unique characters, and assigns the sorted list to the variable `unique_chars`. The initial state specifies that `encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n`.

After executing the code, the value of `unique_chars` will be a sorted list of all unique characters that appear in any of the strings in `encoded`. The list `encoded` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a string b of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of all unique characters present in the strings in `encoded`.**
