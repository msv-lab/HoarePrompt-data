Correctness: **False**

The provided program actually performs the encoding operation instead of the decoding operation as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` is mapping each character in the encoded string `b` to its symmetric character from the sorted unique characters, which is the encoding process, not the decoding process.

To correct this, you need to reverse the mapping logic: for each character in the encoded string `b`, you should map it to the character that was originally mapped to it during the encoding process. Here is the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]] = unique_chars[i]
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded
```

This change will correctly decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.
