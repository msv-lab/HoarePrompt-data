The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines whether the loop will execute. According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop head and do not directly affect whether the loop will execute.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The values of `start` and `end` can remain as they are, as they do not influence the execution of the loop.

State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0**
