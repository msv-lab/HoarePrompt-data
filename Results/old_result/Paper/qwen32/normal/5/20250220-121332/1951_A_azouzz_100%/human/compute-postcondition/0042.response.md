The given print statement is `print('NO')`. This statement directly prints the string 'NO' to the console. The initial state provides information about several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but these variables are not used in the print statement. Therefore, their values do not influence the output of the print statement.

Output: **NO**
