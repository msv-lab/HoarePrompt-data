Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 0; no further iterations occur; `n` and `s` are undefined as they are not retained after the loop ends; `cnt1` is undefined as it is not retained after the loop ends.**

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be 0, indicating that no more iterations will occur. The variables `n` and `s` will not retain their last values as they are only used within the loop and are not stored outside of it. Similarly, `cnt1`, which counts the number of '1's in `s`, will also be undefined outside the loop. The variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
