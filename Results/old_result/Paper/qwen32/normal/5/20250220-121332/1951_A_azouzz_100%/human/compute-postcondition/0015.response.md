The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`) and their properties, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.
2. The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` are defined in the initial state but are not utilized in the `print` statement.
3. Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables, the output remains constant and is `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
