The `print('YES')` statement directly outputs the string 'YES' to the console. The initial state describes several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string provided in the `print` function.

Output: **YES**
