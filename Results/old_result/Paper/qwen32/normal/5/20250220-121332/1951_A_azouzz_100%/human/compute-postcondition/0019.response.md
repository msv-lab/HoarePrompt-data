Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the user input; `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`. If `cnt1` is 1, then the program follows the if part; otherwise, `cnt1` is either 0, 2, or an odd number greater than 2. If `s` contains the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 2 or an odd number greater than 2. If `s` does not contain the substring '11', then `cnt1` is either 0 or 2 or an odd number greater than 2.**
