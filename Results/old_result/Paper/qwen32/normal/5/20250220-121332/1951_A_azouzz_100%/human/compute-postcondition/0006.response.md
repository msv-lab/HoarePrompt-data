The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('YES')
```

The string 'YES' is explicitly provided within the `print` function, and it does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`). 

Therefore, the output will simply be the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
