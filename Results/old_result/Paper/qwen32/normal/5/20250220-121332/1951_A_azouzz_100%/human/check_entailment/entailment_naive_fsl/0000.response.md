Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description at all. The problem description is about generating specific files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subfolders within a specified range of folder names. However, the provided code defines a function `func_1` that reads input, counts occurrences of the character '1' in a string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. This code does not perform any file operations or generate files as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
