Precondition: **number is an integer such that 1 <= number <= 1000, and sequence is a list of integers where each integer X in sequence satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18.** 

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take an integer `t` (number of test cases) and then for each test case, it should handle an integer `X`. Therefore, a more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def func_1(t: int, cases: List[int]):
```

With the precondition:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and cases is a list of integers where each integer X in cases satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18.**
