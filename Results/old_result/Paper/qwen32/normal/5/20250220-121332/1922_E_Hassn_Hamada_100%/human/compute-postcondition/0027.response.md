Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \( 2^{size} \cdot 1.5 \leq \text{number} \leq 1000 \), `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer \(X\) in `sequence` satisfies \(2 \leq X \leq 9\), `size` is `max(sequence, default=0) + 2`, `i` is `max(sequence, default=0) - 1`, `value` is \(\frac{7 \cdot 2^{max(sequence, default=0)}}{4}\)**

Explanation: The value of `size` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `max(sequence, default=0) + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
