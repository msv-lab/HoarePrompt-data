The given code snippet initializes `size_overlap` to the tuple `(0, 0)`. This operation does not affect the values of `number` or `sequence`. Therefore, the values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged. The only change is the initialization of `size_overlap`.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 1 <= number <= 1000, and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18; `size_overlap` is (0, 0)**.
