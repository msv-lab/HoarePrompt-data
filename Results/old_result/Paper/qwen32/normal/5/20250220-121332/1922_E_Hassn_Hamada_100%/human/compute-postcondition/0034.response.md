The code snippet assigns the tuple `(size, i)` to the variable `size_overlap`. This means `size_overlap` now holds the current values of `size` and `i`.

Output State: **`size` is \(\lceil \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - 1 \rceil\), `value` is \(2^{\lceil \log_2(number + (1 << i)) - 1 \rceil} - (1 << i)\), `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the current values of `size` and `i`.**
