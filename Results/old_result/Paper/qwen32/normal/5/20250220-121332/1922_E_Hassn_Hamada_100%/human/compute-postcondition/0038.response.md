The code snippet assigns values to `size` and `value` based on the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is initially `i - 1`, we need to update the values of `size` and `value` accordingly.

- `size` is assigned the value `i + 1`. Since `i` is `i - 1`, `size` becomes `(i - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `i`.
- `value` is assigned the value `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`. This expression can be simplified as follows:
  - `1 << i + 1` is equivalent to `2^(i + 1)`.
  - `1 << i` is equivalent to `2^i`.
  - Therefore, `value` becomes `2^(i + 1) - 2^i`.
  - Factoring out `2^i`, we get `2^i * (2 - 1)`, which simplifies to `2^i`.

So, `size` becomes `i` and `value` becomes `2^i`.

Output State: **`i` is \(i - 1\); `size` is \(i\); `value` is \(2^i\)**.
