Postcondition: **`number` is an integer such that `number` equals 0, and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X in `sequence` satisfies 2 <= X <= 10^18.**

Note: The given if condition `if (number == 0):` contradicts the precondition that `1 <= number <= 1000`. Therefore, the postcondition reflects the scenario where the if condition is true, which means `number` must be 0, despite the initial precondition.
