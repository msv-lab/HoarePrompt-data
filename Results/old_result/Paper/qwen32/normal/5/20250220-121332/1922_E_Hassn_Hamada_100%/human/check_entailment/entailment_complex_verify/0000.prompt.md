You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` between 1 and 1000 and a list of integers `sequence` where each integer is between 2 and \(10^{18}\). The function modifies the `sequence` list by appending additional integers based on the value of `number`. Regardless of the input, the function always returns the tuple (0, 0).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the generation of arrays that result in exactly X increasing subsequences. Specifically, the program does not correctly implement the recursive function `func_1` to generate the required sequence. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence based on the number of increasing subsequences, but it does not correctly ensure that the resulting sequence has exactly X increasing subsequences for all possible values of X within the given range (2 ≤ X ≤ 10¹⁸).

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
```

**Expected Output:**
An array of length at most 200 that has exactly 5 increasing subsequences. One possible output is:
```
3
0 1 0
```
This array has the following increasing subsequences: `[], [0], [1], [0, 1], [0, 0]`, which totals 5 subsequences.

**Actual Output:**
The provided program does not generate a correct sequence for this input. The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the sequence, leading to incorrect results.

To ensure correctness, the program must correctly implement the logic to generate the sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given X. The current implementation does not handle this correctly for all values of X, especially for larger values.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
