Output State: **`size` is 6, `overlap` is 1, `sequence` is updated to include `i + overlap`**

In this output state, the value of `size` remains 6, and the value of `overlap` remains 1. The list `sequence` has been updated to include a new element, which is the value of `i + overlap`. However, the specific value of `i` is not provided, so `sequence` now includes an element that is `i + 1`.
