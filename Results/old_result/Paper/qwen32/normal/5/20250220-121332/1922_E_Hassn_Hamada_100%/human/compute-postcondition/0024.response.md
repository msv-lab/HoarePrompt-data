Output State: **`number` is an integer such that \( 2^{size} \cdot 1.5 \leq \text{number} \leq 1000 \), `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one integer where each integer \(X\) in `sequence` satisfies \(2 \leq X \leq 9\), `size` is `max(sequence, default=0) + 1`, `i` is `max(sequence, default=0) - 1`, `value` is \(2^{max(sequence, default=0) - 1}\)**

In simple terms, the value of `size` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `number`, `sequence`, `i`, and `value` remain unchanged.
