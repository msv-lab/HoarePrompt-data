To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
   - `n` is the new input integer
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is 0

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs while `i <= n - 1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, then print `2`, set `j` to `1`, and break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, increment `i` by 1.

4. **Output States After Iterations:**
   - After 1 iteration: If `l[0] == 2` and `l[1] == 1`, `j` is set to `1` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `j` remains `0` and `i` is incremented to `1`.
   - After 2 iterations: If `l[1] == 3` and `l[2] == 2`, `j` is set to `1` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `j` remains `0` and `i` is incremented to `2`.
   - After 3 iterations: If `l[2] == 4` and `l[3] == 3`, `j` is set to `1` and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `j` remains `0` and `i` is incremented to `3`.

From the above, we can infer that the loop will continue to increment `i` by 1 in each iteration until either:
- The condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met, at which point `j` is set to `1` and the loop breaks.
- `i` reaches `n`, at which point the loop terminates without breaking.

Given that the loop terminates when `i` exceeds `n - 1`, the final state of `i` will be `n` if the condition for breaking the loop is never met.

**Final Output State:**
- `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` remains unchanged as the input integer.
- `l` remains unchanged as the input list of integers.
- `i` will be `n` after the loop finishes.
- `j` will be `1` if the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` was met at any point during the loop; otherwise, it will remain `0`.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; n is the new input integer; l is a list of integers obtained from the input; i is n; j is 1 if the condition l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1 was met at any point, otherwise j is 0.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs until it either finds a pair of consecutive elements in `l` that match the condition or until it has checked all elements up to `n`. The variable `i` will end up being equal to `n`, and `j` will be `1` if the condition was met at any point, otherwise `0`.
