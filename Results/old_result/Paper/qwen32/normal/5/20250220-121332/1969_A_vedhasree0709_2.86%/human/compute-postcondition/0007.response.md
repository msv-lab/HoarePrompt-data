The `print(2)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `2`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
- The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
- The `print(2)` statement directly outputs the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
