Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `j` or the control flow.**
