The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, `n - 1` must be at least 2, which means `n` must be at least 3.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `i` and `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 3; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is 2. If `l[2]` equals `4` and `l[3]` equals `3`, then `j` is set to 1.**
