The `break` statement will exit the nearest enclosing loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement will not have any effect on the flow of the program or the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is at least 2; `l` is a list of integers; `i` is 1; `j` is 1.**
