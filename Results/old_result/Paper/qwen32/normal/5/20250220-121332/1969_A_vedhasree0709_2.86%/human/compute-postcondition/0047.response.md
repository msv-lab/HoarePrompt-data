The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the integer `2`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print(2)`.
2. The integer `2` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i` are defined in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
