Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by checking if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in the list `l` that match the pattern `(i + 2, i + 1)`. If such a pair is found, it concludes that only 2 invitations are needed. Otherwise, it assumes that 3 invitations are necessary. However, this approach is flawed and does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases.

The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations such that at least 2 friends attend the party. Friends `i` and `p_i` will attend if both are invited. The solution needs to consider all possible pairs and ensure that at least two such pairs can be formed with the minimum number of invitations.

The current logic only checks for a specific pattern and does not consider other valid configurations. For example, in the second test case provided in the problem statement, the correct answer is 3, but the program might not correctly identify this for all configurations.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not handle all possible scenarios and does not guarantee the minimum number of invitations needed.

Correctness: **False**
