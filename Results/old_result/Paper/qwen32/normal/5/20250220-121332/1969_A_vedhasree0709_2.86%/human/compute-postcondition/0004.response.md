The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `j`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated input values to integers; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.**
