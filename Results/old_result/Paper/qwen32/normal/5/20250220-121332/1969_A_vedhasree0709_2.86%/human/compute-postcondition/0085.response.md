Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; n is the input integer; l is the list of integers read from the input; i is n; j is 0 indicating that no pair (l[i], l[i + 1]) matches (i + 2, i + 1) during all iterations.**

In simpler terms: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases. The variable `n` remains the input integer representing the length of the list, and `l` remains the list of integers provided as input. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `j` will be `0` if no pair `(l[i], l[i + 1])` matched `(i + 2, i + 1)` throughout all iterations of the loop.
