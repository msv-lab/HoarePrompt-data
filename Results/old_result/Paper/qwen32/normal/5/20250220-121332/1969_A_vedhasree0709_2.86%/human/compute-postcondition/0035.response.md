Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - The current value of `l[i]` is `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

The `print(2)` statement is straightforward. It simply prints the integer `2` regardless of the values of any other variables or the state of the program.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The value to be printed is explicitly `2`.
   - None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`) influence the output of the `print(2)` statement because it directly outputs the number `2`.

**Output:**
Output: **2**
