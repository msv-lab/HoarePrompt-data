The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `size`. If `i` is less than `size`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `size` is 9. For the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `size` remains the same for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`size` is 9, `i` is 2, `sequence` contains [0, 1]**
