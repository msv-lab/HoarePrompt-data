To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the given initial state.

Initial State: `size` is 9, `sequence` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

The code snippet is:
```python
result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
```

Here, `number` is not defined in the initial state, so we'll keep it as `number`. The expression `(1 << size)` shifts the number 1 to the left by `size` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{size}\). Given that `size` is 9, this becomes \(2^9 = 512\).

Thus, the expression `number - (1 << size) + 1` simplifies to `number - 512 + 1`, or `number - 511`.

The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `number - 511` and `sequence`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we know that `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`size` is 9, `sequence` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - 511, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])`.**
