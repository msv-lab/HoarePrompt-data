To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head, which are `i` and `size`. The other mentioned variables (`size`, `sequence`, and `result`) are relevant to the loop's behavior but only `i` and `size` can be directly adjusted according to the loop's syntax.

Given the loop statement:
```
for i in range(size):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `size`. Given that `size` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it should still be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `size` must be at least 2.

The statement about `sequence[-result - 2]` being increased by `result` does not affect the loop's iteration directly, so we do not need to adjust it.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`size` must be at least 2, `i` is 2**.
