The code snippet provided only assigns the integer value `1` to the variable `size`. This does not affect the values of `number` or `sequence`. Therefore, the values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case. `size` is 1.**
