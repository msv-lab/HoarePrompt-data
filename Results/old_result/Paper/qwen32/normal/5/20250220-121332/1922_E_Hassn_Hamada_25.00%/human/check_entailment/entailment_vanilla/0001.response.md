### Reasoning:

The problem requires generating an array of integers such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences. The provided program attempts to solve this by constructing the array based on a recursive function `func_1`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads a single integer `X`.

2. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will result in exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence by finding the largest `size` such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` (which is `2^(size+1) - 1`) is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It appends integers from `0` to `size-1` to the sequence.
   - It then recursively processes the remaining number by subtracting `(1 << size) - 1` from `number`.
   - After the recursive call, it modifies the sequence by adding the result of the recursive call to the last `size` elements of the sequence.

3. **Output**:
   - The length of the generated sequence is printed.
   - The sequence itself is printed as space-separated integers.

### Analysis:

The key idea behind the program is to use a binary representation and a recursive approach to generate the sequence. The function `func_1` seems to be trying to construct a sequence that results in the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`.

However, there are a few concerns:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**: The algorithm seems to be based on the idea of using binary representation to construct the sequence. However, the exact logic of how this binary representation translates to the exact number of increasing subsequences is not immediately clear from the code alone.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when `X` is very large (close to `10^18`) or when `X` is a power of 2 minus 1.
- **Output Constraints**: The program ensures that the length of the sequence is at most 200, but it does not explicitly check if the generated sequence meets the criteria of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

While the program seems to follow a logical approach and handles multiple test cases, the correctness of the algorithm is not immediately apparent without a detailed mathematical proof of the relationship between the binary representation and the number of increasing subsequences.

Given the complexity and the lack of explicit verification in the code, it's safer to assume that the program might not handle all edge cases correctly.

**Correctness: False**

The program might produce correct results for many test cases, but without a rigorous proof, we cannot guarantee its correctness for all possible values of `X` within the given constraints.
