To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem of finding an array with exactly X increasing subsequences.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find an array of integers such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array that are in strictly increasing order and can be obtained by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
   - The length of the array should be at most 200.
   - If no such array exists, we need to output -1.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads an integer X.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` with `n - 1` and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is recursive and generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.
   - The sequence is built in such a way that it generates exactly X increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is then printed as the output.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number `number`.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence needed to generate the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - It appends numbers to the sequence and recursively calls itself to generate the remaining part of the sequence.
   - The function ensures that the sequence generated has exactly the required number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated, the program should output -1.

### Correctness Verification

- **Base Case**:
  - When `number` is 0, the function returns 0, which is correct as no elements are needed to generate 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).

- **Recursive Case**:
  - The function calculates the size of the sequence needed to generate the required number of increasing subsequences.
  - It appends numbers to the sequence and recursively calls itself to generate the remaining part of the sequence.
  - The function ensures that the sequence generated has exactly the required number of increasing subsequences.

- **Output**:
  - The program outputs the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
  - If the sequence cannot be generated, the program should output -1. However, the provided program does not handle the case where it is impossible to generate the required number of increasing subsequences with an array of length at most 200.

### Conclusion

The program seems to follow a correct approach to generate the sequence, but it does not handle the case where it is impossible to generate the required number of increasing subsequences with an array of length at most 200. Therefore, the program may not always produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

**Correctness: False**
