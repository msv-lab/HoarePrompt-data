You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by appending and adjusting its values. It returns the size of the generated sequence, which is either 0 if `number` is 0, or a value calculated as `size + result` where `size` is determined by the binary representation of `number` and `result` is the result of a recursive call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly generate an array that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or reports that it is impossible to find such an array. Here’s a breakdown of the code and why it seems to meet the problem description:

1. **Binary Representation and Sequence Generation**:
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence based on the binary representation of the input number `number`. It recursively decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems, appending elements to the sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given input `X`.
   - The sequence is constructed in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. This is done by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and the fact that each bit in the binary representation corresponds to a certain number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the base case when `number == 0`, returning a size of 0.
   - The while loop ensures that the size of the sequence is chosen such that the maximum number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with that size is just below or equal to `number`.
   - The recursive call to `func_1` handles the remaining part of the number after subtracting the maximum number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with the current size.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The code outputs the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself, which matches the problem description's output format.

4. **Testing with Examples**:
   - The code works correctly for the provided examples. For instance:
     - For `X = 2`, the output is `1 0`, which indeed has 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
     - For `X = 5`, the output is `3 0 1 0`, which has 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`.
     - For `X = 13`, the output is `5 2 2 3 4 2`, which has 13 increasing subsequences.
     - For `X = 37`, the output is `7 -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, which has 37 increasing subsequences.

Given the above points, the code seems to correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for any valid input `X` within the given constraints. No edge cases or inputs seem to be missed, and the code adheres to the problem description accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
