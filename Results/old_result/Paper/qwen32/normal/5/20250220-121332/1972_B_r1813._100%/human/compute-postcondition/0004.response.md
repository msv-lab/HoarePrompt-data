The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable in Python and does not need any specific state, the only variable we need to ensure is `t` for the loop to execute. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Given that `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, we need to make sure that `data` contains at least one element and that the first element is a positive integer.

State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is a positive integer (at least 1), `index` is 1**
