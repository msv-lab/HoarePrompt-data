The value of `index` is incremented by 2, so `index` becomes `1 + 2`, which is `3`. The other variables (`data`, `t`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is a positive integer (at least 1), `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is `data[2]`.**
