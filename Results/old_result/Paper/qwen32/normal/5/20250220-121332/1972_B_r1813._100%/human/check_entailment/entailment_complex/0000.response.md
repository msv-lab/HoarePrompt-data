### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins facing up. The key insight is that the player who starts (Alice) will win if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and will lose if the number of facing-up coins is even. This is because each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by at least one, and the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make the last move, ensuring her victory. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will make the last move, ensuring his victory.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It reads the input, processes each test case, counts the number of "U" (facing-up coins), and prints "YES" if the count is odd and "NO" if the count is even. The program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements.
