Output State: **`data` is a list of strings where the first element `t` is a positive integer (at least 1), `index` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`**.

In simple terms, the variable `n` is now assigned the integer value of the second element in the `data` list, while the other variables remain unchanged.
