In the given initial state, we have a list `data` containing strings. The first element `t` is a positive integer (at least 1). The variable `index` is set to 3, although it is not directly used in the provided print statement. The variable `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`. The variable `s` is set to `data[2]`, and `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`. It is also specified that `count_u` is odd.

However, the provided print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```
This print statement does not depend on the values of `data`, `index`, `n`, `s`, or `count_u`. It simply prints the string 'YES'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **YES**
