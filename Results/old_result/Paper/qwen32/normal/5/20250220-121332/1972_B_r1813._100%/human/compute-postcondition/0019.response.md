Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `data` is a list of strings.
- The first element `t` is defined as `data[0] - 1`. However, this seems contradictory because `data[0]` is a string, and you cannot subtract 1 from a string directly. It's possible there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the description. For the purpose of this task, we'll ignore this part as it does not affect the `print` statement.
- `index` is 5.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`.
- `s` is `data[4]`.
- `count_u` is the number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```
This statement explicitly prints the string `'YES'`.

### Variables and Objects:
- `data`: A list of strings.
- `index`: An integer with a value of 5.
- `n`: An integer derived from the string at `data[3]`.
- `s`: The string at `data[4]`.
- `count_u`: The number of occurrences of 'U' in `s`.

### Explanation:
The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables `data`, `index`, `n`, `s`, or `count_u`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
