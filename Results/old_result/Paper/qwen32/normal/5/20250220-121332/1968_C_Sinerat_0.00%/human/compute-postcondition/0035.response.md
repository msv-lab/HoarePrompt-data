The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again. Therefore, if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration. The condition `n` must be greater than 1 remains the same, but to ensure the loop can execute again, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, which is `i + 2`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`**
