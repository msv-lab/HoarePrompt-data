To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior:

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. In each iteration, the value of `a[i]` is updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. This means that `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `x`, starting with `a[0] = 500`.

After the loop completes, the final state of `a` will be such that:
- `a[0]` remains 500.
- `a[1]` is `500 + x[0]`.
- `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1] = 500 + x[0] + x[1]`.
- `a[3]` is `a[2] + x[2] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`.
- And so on, until `a[n-1]` which will be `500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`.

In summary, the final output state of `a` is a list where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]` is the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements of `x` added to the initial value of `a[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is the cumulative sum of `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500.**
