The code snippet `a = [0] * n` reassigns the list `a` to a new list containing `n` zeros. This means that the previous values of `a` are discarded, and `a` now consists of `n` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all set to 0; `_` is 0**.
