The loop head in the given for loop is `i` and the range it iterates over is from `1` to `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. The variable `n` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the rest are set to 0 if not yet modified
- `_` is 0
- `i` is 2

We need to adjust `i` to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the rest are set to 0 if not yet modified, `_` is 0, `i` is 3**
