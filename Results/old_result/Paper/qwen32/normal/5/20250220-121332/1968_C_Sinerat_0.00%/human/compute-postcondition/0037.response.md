To determine the final state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's analyze the loop and the given initial state.

### Initial State:
- `t`: an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n`: the integer input by the user
- `x`: a list of integers of length `n`
- `a`: a list of integers with `n` elements where the first element is 500 and the rest are 0
- `_`: 1 (This variable is not used in the loop and does not affect the output)
- `i`: `n` (This variable is not used in the loop and does not affect the output)

### Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
```

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (inclusive). In each iteration, it updates the `i-th` element of the list `a` by adding the `(i-1)-th` element of `a` and the `(i-1)-th` element of `x`.

### Iteration Details:
- **First Iteration (`i = 1`)**: `a[1] = a[0] + x[0]`
- **Second Iteration (`i = 2`)**: `a[2] = a[1] + x[1]`
- **Third Iteration (`i = 3`)**: `a[3] = a[2] + x[2]`
- ...
- **Last Iteration (`i = n-1`)**: `a[n-1] = a[n-2] + x[n-2]`

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes, the list `a` will be modified such that each element `a[i]` (for \(1 \leq i < n\)) is the cumulative sum of the initial element `a[0]` (which is 500) and the first `i` elements of `x`.

In other words, `a[i]` will be the sum of 500 and the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.

### Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`a` is a list where `a[0]` is 500 and `a[i]` for `1 <= i < n` is `500 + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])`.**

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop finishes executing, the list `a` will have its first element as 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` will be the sum of 500 and the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `_`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `i` in the loop context will have completed its iterations.
