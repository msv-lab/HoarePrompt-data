The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 1 (since the loop starts at 1 and the previous iteration would have been the first iteration), `n` is greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers where the first element is 500, and the `i`-th element is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, and `_` is 0.

For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` remains the same since it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500, the `i`-th element is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, and the rest are set to 0 if not yet modified; `_` is 0; `i` is 2**
