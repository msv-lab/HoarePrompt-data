The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code will take an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The previous value of `n` is not relevant here as it is being overwritten by the new input value. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `a`, `_`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the integer input by the user; `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements, where the first element is 500, the `i`-th element is the sum of 500 and the first `i-1` elements of `x`, and the rest are set to 0 if not yet modified; `_` is 1; `i` is `n`**.
