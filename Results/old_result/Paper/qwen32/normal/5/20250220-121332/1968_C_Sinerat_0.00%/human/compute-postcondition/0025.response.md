Let's break down the given initial state and the code step by step to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` must be greater than 1.
3. `x` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
4. `a` is a list of integers with `n` elements:
   - The first element is 500.
   - The `i`-th element (for \(i > 1\)) is the sum of 500 and the first \(i-1\) elements of `x`.
   - The rest of the elements (if any) are set to 0 if not yet modified.
5. `_` is 0.
6. `i` is `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*a)
```

### Analysis:
- `a` is a list of length `n`.
- The first element of `a` is always 500.
- For each subsequent element \(a[i]\) (where \(i > 0\)), it is calculated as:
  \[
  a[i] = 500 + \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} x[j]
  \]
  This means the \(i\)-th element of `a` is 500 plus the sum of the first \(i\) elements of `x`.

### Example to Illustrate:
Assume `n = 4` and `x = [100, 200, 300]`.

- `a[0]` is 500 (by definition).
- `a[1]` is \(500 + x[0] = 500 + 100 = 600\).
- `a[2]` is \(500 + x[0] + x[1] = 500 + 100 + 200 = 800\).
- `a[3]` is \(500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2] = 500 + 100 + 200 + 300 = 1100\).

So, the list `a` would be `[500, 600, 800, 1100]`.

### General Case:
- The first element is always 500.
- Each subsequent element is calculated by adding 500 to the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` up to the previous index.

### Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a`, separated by spaces.

Output: **500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2] (where each element is calculated based on the sum of the first i-1 elements of x and 500)**

If we assume the specific values provided in the example, the output would be:
Output: **500 600 800 1100**

However, since the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided, the output is described in terms of the general formula:
Output: **500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], ..., 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2] (where each element is calculated based on the sum of the first i-1 elements of x and 500)**
