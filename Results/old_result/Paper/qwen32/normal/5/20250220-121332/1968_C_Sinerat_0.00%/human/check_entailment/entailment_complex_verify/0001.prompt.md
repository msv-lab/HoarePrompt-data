You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where each element x_i satisfies 1 <= x_i <= 500. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: For each test case, `a` is a list with `n` elements where `a[0]` is 500 and each subsequent element `a[i]` for `1 <= i < n` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of `x` starting from 500. The loop has processed all `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it constructs a list `a` of length `n` such that the first element is 500 and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the input list `x`. The function prints this list `a` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to construct an array `a` of length `n` such that:
- Each element of `a` is between 1 and 10^9.
- For all `i` from 2 to `n`, `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i]`.

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program generates the array `a` as follows:
1. It initializes `a[0]` to 500.
2. For each subsequent element `a[i]`, it sets `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Let's check if this satisfies the conditions:
- `a[0]` is set to 500, which is within the range [1, 10^9].
- For `a[1]`, `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + x[0]`. Since `x[0]` is between 1 and 500, `a[1]` will be between 501 and 1000, which is within the range [1, 10^9].
- For `a[2]`, `a[2] = a[1] + x[1]`. Since `a[1]` is between 501 and 1000 and `x[1]` is between 1 and 500, `a[2]` will be between 1002 and 1500, which is within the range [1, 10^9].
- This pattern continues, ensuring that all `a[i]` are within the required range.

Now, let's check if `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]`:
- `a[1] % a[0] = (500 + x[0]) % 500 = x[0]` (since `500 % 500 = 0`).
- `a[2] % a[1] = ((500 + x[0]) + x[1]) % (500 + x[0]) = x[1]` (since `(500 + x[0]) % (500 + x[0]) = 0`).
- This pattern continues, ensuring that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

### Conclusion
The provided program correctly constructs the array `a` such that all conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response
Reasoning: The program initializes `a[0]` to 500 and then constructs each subsequent element `a[i]` as `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This ensures that each `a[i]` is within the range [1, 10^9] and that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
