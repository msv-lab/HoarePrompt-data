The code snippet provided updates the `nums` list by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (converted to a list of integers) with `[arr[i]]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99
- `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[0]` updated to `nums[0]`
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is False if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains True
- `nums` is a list that contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`

The line `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` updates `nums` to be a list of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

**Output State:** **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[0]` updated to `nums[0]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is False if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains True, `nums` is a list that contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

In simpler terms, `nums` is now a list of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
