The given code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `arr`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state except for `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is `n-1` (must be greater than 0 at the start of the loop), `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is either True or False depending on whether any `nums` constructed during the loop was not sorted.**
