The code snippet takes the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, converts it into a list of its individual digits, and then appends the current element `arr[i]` to this list. The result is stored in the variable `nums`.

Given the initial state, we know that `arr[i - 1]` is an integer and `arr[i]` is an integer that is less than `arr[i - 1]`. The conversion of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits and the appending of `arr[i]` will result in `nums` being a list of these digits followed by `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is True, and `nums` is a list of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
