Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input with `arr[0]` updated to `nums[0]`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is False if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains True. `nums` is a list that contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of `ans` and the loop remains unchanged.**
