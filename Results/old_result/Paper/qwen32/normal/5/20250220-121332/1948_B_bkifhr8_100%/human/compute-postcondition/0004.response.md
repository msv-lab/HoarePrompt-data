The code snippet provided only initializes the variable `ans` to `True`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr`) are modified. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state with the addition of the `ans` variable being set to `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is True.**
