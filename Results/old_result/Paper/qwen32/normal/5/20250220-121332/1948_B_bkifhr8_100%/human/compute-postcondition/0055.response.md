The code snippet `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` modifies the value of `arr` at index `i - 1` to be equal to `nums[0]`. Given that `i` is 1, `arr[0]` is updated to `nums[0]`.

The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`. This means `nums[0]` is the first digit of `arr[0]`.

After executing the code, `arr[0]` will be equal to `nums[0]`, which is the first digit of the original `arr[0]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `arr[1:]`, `i`, `nums`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0]` is the first digit of the original `arr[0]` and the rest of the elements remain the same, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers formed by the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.**
