The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `arr`. This operation does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, and `ans`).

Given the initial state, the value of `arr` will be updated to reflect the integers read from the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is the integer read from the input, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True unless a condition within the loop set it to False.**
