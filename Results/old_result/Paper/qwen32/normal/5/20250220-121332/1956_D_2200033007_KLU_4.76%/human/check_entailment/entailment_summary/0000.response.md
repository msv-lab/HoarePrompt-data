Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array `c` is 2, it outputs a fixed result of `4 1` and `1 2`, and for any other length, it outputs `13 0`. This is clearly not a general solution that calculates the maximum sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Calculate the MEX of the array or any subarray.
2. Perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
3. Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

The provided program does not implement these steps and instead provides hardcoded outputs for very specific cases, which is not a valid solution for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
