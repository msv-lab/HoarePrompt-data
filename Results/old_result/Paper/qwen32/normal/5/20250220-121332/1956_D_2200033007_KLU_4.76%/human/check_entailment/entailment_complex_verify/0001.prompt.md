You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if c == 2:
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else:
        print(f'13 0')
    return



- Annotated Code: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of integers with length n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and each integer in c satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: `c` is a list of integers with length `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18, and each integer in `c` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7. If `c` is equal to the integer 2, the current value of `c` remains 2. Otherwise, `c` is not equal to the integer 2. `m` remains 0 in both cases.
    return
    #The program returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `c`, which is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 18, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10,000,000. The function prints specific lines based on whether `c` is equal to the integer 2 or not, and it returns `None`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program does not perform any operations on the array based on the MEX value and simply prints hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array. This approach does not consider the actual values in the array and the operations that can be performed to maximize the sum of the array.

For example:
- In the first test case, the array is `[0, 1]`. The program outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which is correct because after setting both elements to `2` (the MEX of `{0, 1}`), the sum becomes `4`.
- However, for the second test case, the array is `[1, 3, 9]`. The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect. The initial sum of the array is already `13`, and no operations are needed to achieve this sum. However, if we apply the operation on the entire array, we can set all elements to `0` (the MEX of `{1, 3, 9}`), which is not optimal. The correct approach would be to identify segments of the array that can be increased by applying the MEX operation.

The program does not implement the logic required to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
