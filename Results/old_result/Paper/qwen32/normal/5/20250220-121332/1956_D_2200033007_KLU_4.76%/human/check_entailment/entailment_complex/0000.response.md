Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` makes a decision based solely on the length of the list `c` (which is supposed to be `a`), and it does not consider the actual values of the elements in the list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` checks if the length of the list `c` is exactly 2. If it is, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`. This is only correct for the specific example where the input array is `[0, 1]`. For any other array of length 2, this output might not be correct.
  
2. If the length of the list `c` is not 2, the function prints `13 0`. This is only correct for the specific example where the input array is `[1, 3, 9]`. For any other array, this output might not be correct.

3. The function does not perform any operations on the array `c` to maximize the sum based on the MEX operation as described in the problem statement. It simply prints hardcoded values based on the length of the array.

Thus, the program does not generalize to solve the problem for any input array `a` as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
