### Reasoning:
Let's evaluate the program's logic and correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements in an array equal by performing at most one operation of setting a contiguous subarray to a specific value. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray.

#### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1` attempts to determine the minimum cost by:
1. Identifying the first index `i` where the value changes from the start.
2. Identifying the first index `j` where the value changes from the end.
3. Deciding the minimum cost based on whether the first and last elements are the same.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `j` is initialized to the last index of the array.

2. **Finding the first differing element from the start**:
   - The loop `while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` increments `i` until it finds a different element or reaches the end of the array.

3. **Finding the first differing element from the end**:
   - The loop `while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` decrements `j` until it finds a different element or reaches the start of the array.

4. **Decision Making**:
   - If `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, the program returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This seems to be an attempt to find the middle segment that needs to be changed.
   - Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This considers the minimum cost to change the array from either end.

#### Example Analysis:
1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
   - `i` will be 0 (since `arr[0] == 1` and `arr[1] == 2`).
   - `j` will be 5 (since `arr[5] == 1` and `arr[4] == 5`).
   - Since `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, it returns `max(min(6 - 0 - 1, 5), 0) = max(min(5, 5), 0) = 5`. This is incorrect; the correct answer should be 4. The correct operation would be to change the subarray `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to `1`, which costs 4 burles.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `i` will be 6 (since all elements are the same).
   - `j` will be 0 (since all elements are the same).
   - Since `arr[0] == arr[-1]`, it returns `max(0 - 6 - 1, 0) = max(-7, 0) = 0`. This is correct.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`
   - `i` will be 2 (since `arr[2] == 8` and `arr[3] == 1`).
   - `j` will be 5 (since `arr[5] == 8` and `arr[6] == 8`).
   - Since `arr[0] != arr[-1]`, it returns `max(min(8 - 2 - 1, 5), 0) = max(min(5, 5), 0) = 5`. This is incorrect; the correct answer should be 2. The correct operation would be to change the subarray `[1, 2]` to `8`, which costs 2 burles.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of burles needed in all cases. The logic for determining the cost is flawed, especially when the first and last elements are different.

### Final:
Final: **False**
