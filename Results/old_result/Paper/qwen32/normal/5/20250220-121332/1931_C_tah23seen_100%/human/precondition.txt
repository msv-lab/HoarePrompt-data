arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the size of the array for a test case followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. The first element of arr is the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, the first integer is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and the next n integers are the elements of the array a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
