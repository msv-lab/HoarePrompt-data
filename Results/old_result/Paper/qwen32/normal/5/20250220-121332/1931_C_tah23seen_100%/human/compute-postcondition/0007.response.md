To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition step by step.

The `while` loop condition is:
```
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```
This means the loop will continue to execute as long as:
1. `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`
2. `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2]`
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 2 (though `n` is not used in the loop condition, so it can be ignored for this purpose)
- `j` is `len(arr) - 1`

Let's check the conditions:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1`: If `i` is 2, then `len(arr) - 1` must be greater than 2. Since `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2]`, it implies `len(arr)` is at least 3, so `len(arr) - 1` is at least 2. This condition is satisfied.
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`: Since `i` is 2, we need to check if `arr[2] == arr[3]`. Given the initial state, we only know `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2]`, but we do not have information about `arr[3]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr[2]` must be equal to `arr[3]`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `arr[3]` is equal to `arr[2]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2] == arr[3]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`**
