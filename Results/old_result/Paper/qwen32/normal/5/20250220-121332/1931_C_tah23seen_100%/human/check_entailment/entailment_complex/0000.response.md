Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by identifying the longest contiguous subarray that can be changed to make the entire array uniform, given the constraints. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is not entirely correct for all cases. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and its issues:

1. **Identifying the first and last differing elements**:
    - The program correctly identifies the first index `i` where the element is different from the previous one and the last index `j` where the element is different from the next one.
    - If all elements are the same, the function correctly returns 0.

2. **Handling the case where the first and last elements are the same**:
    - If the first and last elements are the same, the function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This is correct because the subarray from `i+1` to `j-1` can be changed to make the entire array uniform, and the cost is `j - i - 1`.

3. **Handling the case where the first and last elements are different**:
    - If the first and last elements are different, the function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to make the entire array uniform with a single operation. The correct approach would be to consider changing the subarray either from the start to `j` or from `i` to the end, whichever is shorter. Thus, the correct return statement should be `min(n - i, j + 1)`.

Given the above issues, the function does not correctly handle all cases, specifically when the first and last elements are different, and it might not always return the minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
