Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The function `func_1` attempts to find the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal by selecting a segment and replacing all its elements with a single value. However, the logic used in `func_1` is flawed and does not cover all possible cases.

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:

1. It initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to `len(arr) - 1`.
2. It then increments `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, effectively finding the length of the initial segment of identical elements from the start.
3. Similarly, it decrements `j` as long as `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`, finding the length of the final segment of identical elements from the end.
4. If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
5. Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

The logic fails in several cases:

- **Case 1:** When the array has a repeating pattern but the first and last elements are different, the function may not return the correct result. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`. The function will not correctly identify the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal.
- **Case 2:** When the array has multiple segments of different elements, the function does not consider the optimal segment to replace. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function will return `4`, but the optimal solution is to replace the middle segment `[2, 3, 4]` with `1`, which would cost `3` burles.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible segments and find the one that minimizes the cost of making all elements equal. The provided function does not handle these cases correctly.

Here is an example where the function fails:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1 2 3 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output from the function:**
```
4
```

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
