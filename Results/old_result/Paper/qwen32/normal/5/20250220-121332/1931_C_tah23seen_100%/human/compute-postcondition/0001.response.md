The code snippet `n = len(arr)` assigns the length of the list `arr` to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers structured in a specific way, but the length of `arr` is not explicitly given. After executing the code, the variable `n` will hold the length of `arr`, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `i` is 0; `n` is the length of `arr`.**
