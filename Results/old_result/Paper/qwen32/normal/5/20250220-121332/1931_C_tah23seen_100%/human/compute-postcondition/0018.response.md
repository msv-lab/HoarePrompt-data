Output State: **The program returns the maximum of (j - i - 1) and 0, where j is the index of the first element from the end that is different from the previous element, or 0 if all elements are the same.**

To break it down:
- `j` is the index of the first element from the end that differs from the previous element, or 0 if all elements in `arr` are the same.
- `i` remains the same, and its value is not specified.
- `n` remains the same, and its value is not specified.
- The first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`.

The program calculates the difference between `j` and `i`, subtracts 1, and returns the maximum of this result and 0. If all elements in `arr` are the same, `j` will be 0, and the function will return 0.
