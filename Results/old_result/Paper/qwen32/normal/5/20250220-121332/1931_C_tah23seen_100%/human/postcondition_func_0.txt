The function accepts a list of integers `arr` where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, the first integer `n` is followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. The function returns the maximum length of a subarray that does not include the first and last elements if they are the same, or the maximum length of a subarray starting from the first element or ending at the last element, excluding the first or last element respectively, if the first and last elements are different. If all elements in a test case are the same, it returns 0.
