Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The first element `t` of `arr` indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, the first integer `n` is followed by `n` integers representing the elements of the array. The function returns the maximum of `(j - i - 1)` and `0` if there exists an index `j` from the end that is different from the previous element, otherwise it returns `0`. If all elements in a test case are the same, it returns `0`. In another case, it returns the maximum of `n - i - 1` and `j`.**
