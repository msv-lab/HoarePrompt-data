To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

The loop condition is:
```
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```
This means the loop will continue to execute as long as two conditions are satisfied:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1` (i.e., `i` is less than the second last index of the array)
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` (i.e., the current element at index `i` is equal to the next element at index `i + 1`)

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1]`
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the length of `arr` and `n > 1`
- `j` is `len(arr) - 1`

Let's evaluate the conditions:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1` translates to `1 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `1 < n - 1` or `n > 2`. Since we know `n > 1`, this condition can be satisfied if `n > 2`.
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` translates to `arr[1] == arr[2]`. Since we know `arr[0] == arr[1]`, we need to ensure `arr[1] == arr[2]` for the loop to continue.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- We need `n > 2` to satisfy the first condition.
- We need `arr[1] == arr[2]` to satisfy the second condition.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and the elements of `arr` starting from the third element (index 2).

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0] == arr[1] == arr[2]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is `len(arr) - 1`**
