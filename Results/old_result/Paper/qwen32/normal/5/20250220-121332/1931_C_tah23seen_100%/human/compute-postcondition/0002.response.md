The variable `j` is assigned the value `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `arr`. The other variables `arr`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) is followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `i` is 0; `n` is the length of `arr`; `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
