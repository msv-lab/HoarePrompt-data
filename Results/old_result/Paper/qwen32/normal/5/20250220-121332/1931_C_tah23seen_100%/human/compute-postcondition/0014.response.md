To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition `j > 0`**:
   - This condition ensures that `j` is a valid index in the list `arr` and that we have not reached the beginning of the list.
   - Since `j` is already given as `j - 1` and must be greater than 1, we need to ensure that after decrementing `j`, it remains greater than 0. Therefore, `j` must have been at least 2 before the decrement.

2. **Condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`**:
   - This condition ensures that the current element at index `j` is equal to the previous element at index `j - 1`.
   - Given the state that `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements where the last two elements are equal, we need to ensure that the elements at indices `j` and `j - 1` are equal.

### Adjustment:
- Since `j` is `j - 1` and must be greater than 1, `j` should be set to a value that satisfies both `j > 0` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.
- Given that `arr` has at least two elements where the last two elements are equal, we can set `j` to the second last index of `arr` to ensure `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` should be set to `n - 1` (the last index of the array) before the decrement, so after decrementing, `j` will be `n - 2` (the second last index), which satisfies both conditions.

### Final State:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements where the last two elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element that is different from the previous one or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `j` is `n - 1`**.
