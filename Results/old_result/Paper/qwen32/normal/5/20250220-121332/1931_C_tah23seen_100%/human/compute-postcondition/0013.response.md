Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements where the last two elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element that is different from the previous one or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `j` is `j - 1` (where `j` must be greater than 1).**

In simple terms: The list `arr` remains unchanged, as do the values of `i` and `n`. The value of `j` is decreased by 1, but it still must be greater than 1.
