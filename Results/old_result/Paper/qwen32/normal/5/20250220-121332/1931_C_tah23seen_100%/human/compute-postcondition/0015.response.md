Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements where the last two elements are equal, `i` is the index of the first element that is different from the previous one or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same, `n` is the length of `arr`, and `j` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` now holds the value `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
