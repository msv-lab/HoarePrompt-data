Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints the difference between these counts, which is unrelated to the penalty calculation process described.

The problem requires splitting the string into non-empty arrays such that the sum of penalties of these arrays is minimized. The penalty for each array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program does not perform any splitting or penalty calculation. It merely computes the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

To illustrate the issue, consider the counterexample provided in the original assessment:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  +--
  ```
- Expected Output: `1`
  - Explanation: One optimal split is `([+], [--])`. The penalty for `[+]` is `|1| * 1 = 1` and for `[--]` is `|-2| * 2 = 4`. However, a better split is `([+-], [-])`. The penalty for `[+-]` is `|0| * 2 = 0` and for `[-]` is `|-1| * 1 = 1`. Thus, the total penalty is `0 + 1 = 1`.
- Actual Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The program calculates `1 - 2 = -1` and prints `0` (since the difference is negative, it prints the absolute value of the difference).

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **False**
