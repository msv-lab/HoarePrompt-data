Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task requires calculating the minimum possible penalty based on how the array can be optimally split into subarrays. The penalty for each subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program, however, simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and prints this difference. This approach does not consider any splitting of the array or the penalty calculation as specified in the problem statement.

For example, consider the third test case in the given input-output pair:
Input: `+-+-+-`
The correct output should be `0` because the string can be split into `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])` where each subarray has a penalty of `0`. However, the provided program would output `-1` (3 '-' and 2 '+'), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
