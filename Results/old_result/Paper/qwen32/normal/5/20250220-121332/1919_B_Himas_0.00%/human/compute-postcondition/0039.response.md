Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `s` is the new input integer, `e` is the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is incremented by 1, `q` is the next character in `e` after the current `q`. If `q` is '+', `P` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `M` is incremented by 1.**
