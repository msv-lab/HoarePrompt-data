### Reasoning:

The provided program is not correct based on the problem description. The task is to calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array optimally, but the given code does not perform any splitting or calculation of penalties as described. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints their difference. This does not solve the problem as stated.

Here's a breakdown of what the program does:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the string `n` (which is immediately cast to an integer and then discarded).
   - It reads the string `s`.
   - It initializes two counters, `P` and `M`, to zero.
   - It iterates over each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is '+', it increments `P`.
     - If the character is '-', it increments `M`.
   - It prints the difference `P - M`.

The correct approach would involve finding an optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray. The given program does not attempt to perform any splitting or penalty calculation.
