Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this specific task.
- `s` is the new input integer. The value of `s` is not relevant to the given print statement.
- `e` is the new input string.
- `i` is `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not relevant to the given print statement.
- `P` is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` is the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(P - M)
```

### Analysis:
The print statement will output the difference between `P` (the count of '+' characters in `e`) and `M` (the count of non-'+' characters in `e`).

### Explanation:
- `P` is the number of times the character '+' appears in the string `e`.
- `M` is the number of characters in the string `e` that are not '+'.

Therefore, `P - M` will give the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of other characters in the string `e`.

### Output:
The output will be the result of the expression `P - M`, which is the difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`.

Output: **P - M (where P is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`, and M is the count of non-'+' characters in the string `e`)**
