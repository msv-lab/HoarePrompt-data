The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it satisfies the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, and it satisfies the constraint 1 <= n <= 5000. The string `s` consists only of the characters '+' and '-'.

The function processes each test case individually. For each test case, it evaluates the string `s` and performs the following:
- Case_1: If the string `s` contains an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, the function returns 0.
- Case_2: If the string `s` contains more '+' characters than '-' characters, the function returns the count of '+' characters minus the count of '-' characters.
- Case_3: If the string `s` contains more '-' characters than '+' characters, the function returns the count of '-' characters minus the count of '+' characters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and, for each test case, an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of '+' and '-'. It returns 0 if the counts of '+' and '-' are equal, the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' if there are more '+' characters, or the difference between the counts of '-' and '+' if there are more '-' characters.**
