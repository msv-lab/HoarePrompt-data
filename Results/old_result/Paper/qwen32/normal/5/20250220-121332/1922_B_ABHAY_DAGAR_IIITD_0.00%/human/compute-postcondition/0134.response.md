To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

- `test_cases` is 0: This variable indicates the number of test cases, but it is not used in the `print(result)` statement.
- `results` is a list containing at least one `res` value: This means that `results` is a list, and it contains at least one element, which is `res`.
- `n` is the last input integer: This variable represents the last integer input, but it is not used in the `print(result)` statement.
- `num_list` is the last list of integers from the input: This is the last list of integers provided as input, but it is not used in the `print(result)` statement.
- `num_of_lens` is the dictionary from the last iteration with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values: This dictionary maps each unique integer in the last input list to its count, but it is not used in the `print(result)` statement.
- `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` from the last iteration: This variable holds the total count of all integers in the last input list, but it is not used in the `print(result)` statement.
- `res` is the final accumulated value after all iterations: This variable holds the final accumulated result after processing all test cases, but it is not directly used in the `print(result)` statement.
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list: This variable holds the next element from the `results` list, which is the value that will be printed.

Given the above information, the `print(result)` statement will print the next element in the `results` list. Since `results` contains at least one `res` value, `result` will be that `res` value.

Therefore, the output of the `print(result)` statement will be the value of `res` from the `results` list.

Output: **res (where res is the next element in the results list)**
