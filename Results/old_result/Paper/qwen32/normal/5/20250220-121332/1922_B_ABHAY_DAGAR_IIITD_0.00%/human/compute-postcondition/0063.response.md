The code snippet provided resets the variable `res` to `0`. This does not affect any other variables or their states. Therefore, the Output State will reflect this change for `res` while keeping the rest of the variables unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values, `res` is 0, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `test_cases` must be greater than the current iteration count.**
