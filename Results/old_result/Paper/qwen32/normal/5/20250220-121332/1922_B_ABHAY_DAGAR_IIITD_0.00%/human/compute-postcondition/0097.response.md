The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the last element of `num_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least one more element, and `x` should be the next element in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least two integers, `x` is the next element in `num_list`**
