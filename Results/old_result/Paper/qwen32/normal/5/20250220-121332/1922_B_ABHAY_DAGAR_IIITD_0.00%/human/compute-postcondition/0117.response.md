The code snippet modifies the value of `res` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. The values of other variables like `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_count` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `total_count` is `total_count` + `cnt_current`. If `cnt_current` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is unchanged. Otherwise, `res` remains 0, `cnt` is `cnt_next`, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.**
