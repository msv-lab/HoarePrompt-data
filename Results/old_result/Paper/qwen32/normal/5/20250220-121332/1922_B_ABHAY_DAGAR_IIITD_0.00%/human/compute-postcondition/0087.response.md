The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation condition. The loop continues based on the `test_cases` variable. Since `_` is not used within the loop, we only need to consider `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` would have been decremented by 1 (or the loop counter would have been incremented, depending on how you interpret the loop). For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Since `test_cases` is the controlling factor, we need to ensure it is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1, `results` is a list containing `res` (computed as described) and the newly appended `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
