The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If there are more values in `num_of_lens`, the loop will execute again for the next value.

At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` held the value from the last key-value pair in `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_of_lens` must have at least one more value that `cnt` can take.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**
