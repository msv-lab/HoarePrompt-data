The code snippet `num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `num_list`. This means `num_list` will now hold the integers provided in the input.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, and `total_count`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is a list containing `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `num_list` and values as their respective counts, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 items from counts `cnt >= 3` and all combinations of 2 items from counts `cnt >= 2` multiplied by the cumulative `total_count` at that point, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, and `test_cases` must be greater than the current iteration count.**
