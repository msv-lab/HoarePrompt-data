The code snippet `results.append(res)` appends the current value of `res` to the `results` list. This changes the `results` list by adding one more element, which is the value of `res`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples minus 1; `results` is a list containing `res` and the newly appended `res` values from each iteration; `n` is the input integer; `num_list` is the list of integers from the input; `num_of_lens` is the dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `num_list`; `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`; `res` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.**
