The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, `cnt` will take on the next value from `num_of_lens.values()` in the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples.
- `results` is a list containing `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `results` remains `res`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair).
- `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`.
- `cnt` is `cnt_next`.
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to identify the next value of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`. Since we do not have the specific values of `num_of_lens`, we can denote the next value as `cnt_next`.

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples; `results` is a list containing `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `results` remains `res`; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least one integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values (and must have at least one key-value pair); `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`; `cnt` is `cnt_next`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

Since `cnt` will take the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, we denote this next value as `cnt_next`. No other variables in the loop head need adjustment.
