You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        
        res = 0
        
        total_count = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        
        results.append(res)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is 0; `results` is a list containing `res` values from each iteration; `n` is the last input integer; `num_list` is the last list of integers from the input; `num_of_lens` is the dictionary from the last iteration with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values; `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` from the last iteration; `res` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is 0, `results` is a list containing all `res` values, `n` is the last input integer, `num_list` is the last list of integers from the input, `num_of_lens` is the dictionary from the last iteration with each unique integer from `num_list` as keys and their respective counts as values, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` from the last iteration, `res` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and the list of integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
