Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` has been updated to include the new calculation `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial conditions.
