To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects mentioned in the loop head. In this case, the loop iterates over `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair so that `num_of_lens.values()` is not empty.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`cnt`**: This variable is used to iterate over the values of `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one value.
2. **`num_of_lens`**: This dictionary must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `num_list` and values as their respective counts.
- `res` is 0.
- `total_count` is 0.

We need to adjust the state such that `num_of_lens` is not empty. This means `num_list` must contain at least one integer, and `num_of_lens` should be constructed accordingly.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair (e.g., `{some_integer: some_count}`), `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0**

For example, if `num_list` is `[5]`, then `num_of_lens` would be `{5: 1}`.

Final adjusted state:
State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0**
