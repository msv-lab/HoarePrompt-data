The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `x` is a key in `num_of_lens` and already has some value. After executing the code, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` will be increased by 1.

Output State: **`test_cases` is the length of the list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been incremented by 1.**
