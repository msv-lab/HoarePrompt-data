You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that s represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n`, and values representing the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` is `n-1`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: ans is s.
    return ans
    #The program returns the variable `ans` which is `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the sorting step. The problem description specifies that the sorting should be done in increasing order of prefix balance, and ties should be broken in decreasing order of position. However, the current implementation of the sorting step does not break ties in decreasing order of position. Instead, it uses the default behavior of the sorting function, which breaks ties in increasing order of position.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
```
This line sorts the items by the prefix balance (`x[1]`), but it does not specify how to handle ties. To correctly implement the tie-breaking rule, the sorting key should be a tuple where the first element is the prefix balance and the second element is the negative of the position (to sort in decreasing order of position when prefix balances are the same).

The corrected sorting line should be:
```python
d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
```

Without this correction, the program may produce incorrect results for certain input sequences where the prefix balances are the same but the positions are different. For example, consider the input "((()))":

- The prefix balances and positions are:
  Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1| 0  
  ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7  
  Character| (| (| (| )| )| )| )  
  
- The sorted table should be:
  Prefix balance| 0| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
  ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  Position| 1| 7| 6| 5| 2| 4| 3| 8| 4  
  Character| (| )| )| )| (| )| (| )| )  
  
- The balanced shuffle should be: "((()))" (which is the same as the input in this case, but the sorting logic is crucial for other cases).

However, the current implementation would sort the positions in increasing order when the prefix balances are the same, which would result in an incorrect shuffle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
