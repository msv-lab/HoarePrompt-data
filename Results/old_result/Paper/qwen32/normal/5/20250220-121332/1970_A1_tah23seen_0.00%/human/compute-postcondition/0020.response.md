The code snippet sorts the dictionary `d` by its values, which represent the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in the string `s`. This operation does not change the values of `s`, `n`, `ans`, or `i`. The dictionary `d` is now a list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance values.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the cumulative balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`; `i` is `n-1`.**
