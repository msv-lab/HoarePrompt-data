The code snippet `d = {}` initializes an empty dictionary `d`. The initial state of the variables `s`, `n`, and `ans` remains unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" such that `s` represents a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is an empty dictionary.**
