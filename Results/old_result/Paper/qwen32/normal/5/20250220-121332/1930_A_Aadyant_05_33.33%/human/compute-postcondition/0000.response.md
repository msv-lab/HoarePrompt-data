The code snippet provided only includes `num = input()`, which means it reads a line of input and assigns it to the variable `num`. Given the initial state, this input is expected to be the integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. Therefore, after executing this line, `num` will hold the value of `t` as a string. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. `num` is a string equal to the input value of `t`.**
