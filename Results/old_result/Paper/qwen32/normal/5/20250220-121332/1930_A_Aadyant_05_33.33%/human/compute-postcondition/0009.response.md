The code snippet `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1` in ascending order. This means that the order of the substrings in `list1` will be rearranged based on their lexicographical order. The values of `num`, `out`, `list2`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing a positive integer (1 ≤ int(num) ≤ 5000), `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a sorted list of substrings from the input string `b`, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the original string `num` (1 ≤ a ≤ 5000), `b` is the input string.**
