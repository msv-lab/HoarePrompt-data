The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `out`. This list will be used to potentially store results from the test cases, but no operations are performed to modify or populate it in the given snippet. The initial state of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and the integers on the whiteboard) remains unchanged.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), indicating that there are 2n integers on the whiteboard. The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), which are the numbers written on the whiteboard. `num` is a string equal to the input value of `t`. `out` is an empty list.**
