The given code reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and assigns them to a list `a` with an additional `0` at the beginning. This means the length of `a` will be `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of integers in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining `n` elements are the integers read from the input.**
