You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5. c is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9). For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining `n` elements are the integers read from the input; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers, where each `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `b[1]` to `b[i]` with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is `n`; `x` is 1 if `a[n] > 1` else 2.`
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the original `a`; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers, where each `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from `b[1]` to `b[i]` with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2; `i` is `n`; `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers read from the input; the program has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each of the `q` queries.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `c`, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. The list `c` contains `n` integers, each greater than 0. For each query, it accepts two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing a range within the list `c`. The function processes these test cases and queries and returns the sum of elements in the list `c` for each query range `[l_i, r_i]`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
