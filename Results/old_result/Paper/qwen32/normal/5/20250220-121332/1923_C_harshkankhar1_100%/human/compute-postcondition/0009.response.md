The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range `(1, n + 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining `n` elements are the integers read from the input; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers, with `b[1]` equal to `x` and `b[2]` equal to `2 * x`, and all other elements still 0; `i` is 3; `x` is 1 if `a[2] > 1` else 2**
