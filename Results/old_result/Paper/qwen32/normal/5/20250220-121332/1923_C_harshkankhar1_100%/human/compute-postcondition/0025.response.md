Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `c` of `n` integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` defining a range within the list `c`. The function then determines for each query whether the sum of elements in the range `[l_i, r_i]` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in that range that are greater than 1, printing 'YES' if true and 'NO' otherwise.**
