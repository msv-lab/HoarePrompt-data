The value of `x` is updated based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the new value of `x` is determined by whether `a[2]` is greater than 1 or not. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining `n` elements are the integers read from the input; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers, with `b[1]` equal to `x` and all other elements still 0; `i` is 2; `x` is 1 if `a[2] > 1` else 2**
