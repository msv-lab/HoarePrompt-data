The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `arr`. If there are more elements in `arr` to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last number processed from `arr`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `arr` that hasn't been processed yet. Therefore, `num` should be the next element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, it is now `k`; otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged; other elements in `frequency_table` remain unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**
