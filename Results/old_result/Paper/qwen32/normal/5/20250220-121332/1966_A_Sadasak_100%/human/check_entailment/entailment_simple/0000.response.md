### Reasoning:

The given Python program is intended to solve the problem by determining the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards (`n`) and the exchange parameter (`k`).
   - It also reads the list of card numbers (`nums`).

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, no operations can be performed, and the program correctly prints `n` as the result.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It caps the frequency at `k` for each card number, which is not the correct approach for solving this problem. The correct approach is to determine the total number of cards that can be reduced through the allowed operations, not to cap individual frequencies at `k`.

4. **Logic for Minimum Cards**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if true. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the actual reduction of cards through the operations.
   - If `k` is not in the frequency table, it prints `n`, which is also incorrect in many cases as it does not consider the possibility of reducing cards through the operations.

### Correctness:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the allowed operations. The main issue lies in the frequency calculation and the logic for determining the minimum number of cards.

**Correctness: False**

The program needs to be revised to correctly calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the operations, possibly by calculating the total number of cards that can be reduced through the operations and adjusting the total count accordingly.
