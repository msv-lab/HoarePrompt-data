Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; if `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k` before the increment, it remains `k`; otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is incremented by 1; other elements in `frequency_table` remain unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `num` in `frequency_table` by 1. If the count was already greater than `k` before the increment, it is capped at `k`. All other elements in `frequency_table` and the list `arr` remain unchanged.
