Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `frequency_table[num]` is `k`; other elements in `frequency_table` remain unchanged; `num` is the next element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The value of `frequency_table[num]` is directly set to `k`, regardless of its previous value. All other elements in `frequency_table` and the list `arr` remain unchanged. The variable `num` retains its value as the next element in `arr`.
