### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis
The goal is to minimize the number of cards by repeatedly performing the operation of exchanging `k` cards of the same number for `k-1` cards. The key observation is that for each card number that appears `f` times, the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the operation as many times as possible is `f % (k-1)`. This is because each operation reduces the count of that card number by `k`, and the remainder after this process is `f % (k-1)`.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the frequency of each card number but incorrectly limits the frequency to `k`. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct approach is to calculate the exact frequency of each card number.
3. **Decision Making**: The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values, which is not a reliable condition to determine the minimum number of cards. The logic to calculate the minimum number of cards is incorrect.

#### Annotations
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call. However, they do not address the incorrect logic used to determine the minimum number of cards.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the frequency of each card number.
2. For each frequency `f`, determine the remainder when `f` is divided by `k-1` (i.e., `f % (k-1)`).
3. The minimum number of cards left will be the sum of these remainders, with a minimum of 1 (since no operations can leave zero cards if `n > 0`).

#### Evaluation
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards. It incorrectly limits the frequency to `k` and uses an unreliable condition to decide the output.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
