Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number written on a card, and `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100. The length of `arr` (number of cards) is `n`, where 1 <= n <= 100. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a different `n` and `k`, and a corresponding list of integers `arr`. `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. This does not affect the values of `arr` and `k`, nor does it change the conditions on `n` and `k`. The only change is that a new variable `frequency_table` is introduced with an empty dictionary as its value.
