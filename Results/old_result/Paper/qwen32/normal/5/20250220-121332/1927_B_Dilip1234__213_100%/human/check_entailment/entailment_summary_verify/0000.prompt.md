You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Function Summary: 
The function constructs and returns a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, where each character in the string corresponds to an integer in the input list `a`. The character is chosen such that the number of times it appears in the string matches the value specified by the corresponding integer in `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not guarantee that the string `s` will be constructed such that the trace `a` is accurately represented. The issue arises because the program does not ensure that the character at position `i` in `s` is the same as the character at a previous position `j` (where `j < i`) exactly `a[i]` times.

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
    return s
```

The program iterates through each position `i` in the trace `a` and looks for a character `chr(j + ord('a'))` that has been used exactly `a[i]` times so far. If it finds such a character, it appends it to the string `s` and increments its count.

However, this approach does not guarantee that the character at position `i` will be the same as the character at a previous position `j` (where `j < i`) exactly `a[i]` times. It simply finds the first character that has been used `a[i]` times and appends it, which may not be the correct character.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

Input:
```
1
5
0 0 1 0 1
```

Expected Output:
```
ababa
```

Program Output:
```
abaca
```

In this example, the program might choose 'c' for the third position (where `a[2] = 1`) instead of 'b', which would be the correct character according to the trace.

To fix this, the program needs to keep track of which characters have been used at each position and ensure that the character at position `i` is the same as the character at a previous position `j` (where `j < i`) exactly `a[i]` times. One way to do this is to use a list of lists to keep track of the characters used at each position and ensure that the character at position `i` is the same as the character at a previous position `j` (where `j < i`) exactly `a[i]` times.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    s = []
    char_count = [0] * 26
    char_positions = [[] for _ in range(26)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == 0:
            # Find the first character that has not been used yet
            for j in range(26):
                if char_count[j] == 0:
                    s.append(chr(j + ord('a')))
                    char_count[j] += 1
                    char_positions[j].append(i)
                    break
        else:
            # Find the character that has been used exactly a[i] times
            for j in range(26):
                if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                    s.append(chr(j + ord('a')))
                    char_count[j] += 1
                    char_positions[j].append(i)
                    break
    
    return ''.join(s)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

This corrected version ensures that the character at position `i` is the same as the character at a previous position `j` (where `j < i`) exactly `a[i]` times, thus accurately representing the trace `a`.
