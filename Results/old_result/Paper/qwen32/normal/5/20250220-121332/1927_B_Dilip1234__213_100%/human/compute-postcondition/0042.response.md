The code snippet `char_count[j] += 1` increments the count at the index `j` in the `char_count` list by 1. Given the initial state, `char_count` is a list with all elements initialized to 1. Therefore, after the increment, the element at index `j` will be 2, and all other elements will remain 1.

Output State: **`s` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' + character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet, `char_count = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]` if `j` is 25, `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1]` if `j` is 24, and so on, with the 2 at the index `j`, `i = i`, `n = unchanged`**. 

In simpler terms, the character count at index `j` is incremented by 1, making it 2, while all other counts remain 1. The string `s` and the value of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
