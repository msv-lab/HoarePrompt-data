Reasoning:  
The program provided is intended to solve the problem by iterating through each number from 1 to n for each test case, calculating the sum of the digits of each number, and then summing these results. However, there are a few issues with the provided code:

1. The variable `soma` is being reused across all test cases without being reset. This means that the sum from the previous test case will carry over to the next, which is incorrect.
2. The outer loop `for _ in range(N):` is iterating `N` times, which is the number of test cases, but it should be iterating over the range of numbers for each test case.
3. The function `func_1` is correctly defined to return the sum of the digits of a number.

To fix the program, we need to ensure that `soma` is reset for each test case and that we correctly iterate over the range of numbers for each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0  # Reset soma for each test case
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Iterate from 1 to n, inclusive
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)  # Print the result for each test case
```

Since the provided code does not correctly handle the reset of `soma` for each test case and the correct iteration over the range of numbers for each test case, the original code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
