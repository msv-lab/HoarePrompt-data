The code snippet assigns the value `'YES'` to the variable `l`, irrespective of its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the new state of the program is that `l` is now `'YES'`.

Output State: **`l` is `'YES'`, `t` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the user's inputs, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**.
