Output State: **`l` is 'YES', `t` is unchanged, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the user's input, `b` is the user's input, `c` is the user's input. Currently, at index `i`, `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.**

Natural Language: The variable `l` has been explicitly set to 'YES'. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The condition that at index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` still holds true.
