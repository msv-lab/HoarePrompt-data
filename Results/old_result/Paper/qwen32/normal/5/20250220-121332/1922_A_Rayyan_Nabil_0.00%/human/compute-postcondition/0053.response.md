To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it checks if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`. If such an index exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given that the output state after the first 3 iterations is the same as described for each individual iteration, we can infer that the loop processes each test case independently and the result of each test case does not affect the subsequent ones. Therefore, after all `t` iterations, the output will be the result of the last test case processed.

Since the problem does not specify the exact input for each test case, we can only describe the output state in terms of the last test case processed. The output state after all iterations will be the result of the last test case, which is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition described.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be the result of the last test case, which is either 'YES' or 'NO'.

Output State: **the result of the last test case ('YES' or 'NO')**

In natural language, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) in the last test case such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, it will be 'NO'.
