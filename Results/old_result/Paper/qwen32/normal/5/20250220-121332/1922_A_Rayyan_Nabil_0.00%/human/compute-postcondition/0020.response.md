The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. This means `n` will hold the integer value provided by the user input. The variables `l`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer.**
