To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are input strings.

2. **Loop Code:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
           l = 'YES'
   else:
       l = 'NO'
   ```
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - During each iteration, if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, `l` is set to 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without setting `l` to 'YES', `l` is set to 'NO' in the `else` clause of the `for` loop.

3. **Logic of the Loop:**
   - The loop checks each index `i` from 0 to `n-1` to see if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
   - If it finds any such index, it sets `l` to 'YES'.
   - If it doesn't find any such index after checking all `n` indices, it sets `l` to 'NO'.

4. **Final Output State:**
   - After all iterations, `l` will be 'YES' if there is at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
   - If no such index exists, `l` will be 'NO'.

Given the loop's behavior, the final output state for `l` after all iterations is determined by the condition checked within the loop. The value of `i` will be `n` after the loop completes, and `t` remains unchanged.

**Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `l` will be 'YES' if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`; otherwise, it will be 'NO'.
