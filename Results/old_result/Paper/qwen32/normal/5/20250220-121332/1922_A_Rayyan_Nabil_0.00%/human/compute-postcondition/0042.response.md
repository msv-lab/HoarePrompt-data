Postcondition: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` (0 <= i < n) such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`; otherwise, `l` is 'NO'. `t` is unchanged. `n` must be greater than 0. `a` is the user's input, `b` is the user's input, `c` is the user's input. Currently, at index `i`, `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.**
