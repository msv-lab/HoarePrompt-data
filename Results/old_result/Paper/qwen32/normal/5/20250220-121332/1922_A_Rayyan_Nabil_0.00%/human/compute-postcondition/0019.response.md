The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` and ensure that the loop can execute again based on these variables. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and the loop will start the next iteration with `i` incremented by 1. The variable `t` remains unchanged and dictates the total number of iterations the loop should perform.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `l` is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition checked within the loop. However, since the loop head does not include `l`, `a`, `b`, or `c`, we do not need to adjust these variables.

State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same**.

Since we need to specify the exact state at the start of the next iteration, let's assume `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`.

State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is `x + 1`, `t` remains the same**

For a more concrete example, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 2, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is 3, `t` remains the same**

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize it as `i` being incremented by 1.

Final State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same**

For clarity and to match the required format:

State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is `x + 1`, `t` remains the same**

Since we do not have the specific value of `x`, we can simply state:

State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same**

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same**
