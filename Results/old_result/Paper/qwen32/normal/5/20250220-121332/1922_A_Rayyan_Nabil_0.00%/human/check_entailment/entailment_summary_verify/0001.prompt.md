You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length `n`. For each test case, it determines if every character in string `c` matches at least one of the corresponding characters in strings `a` or `b`. It prints 'YES' if this condition is met for all characters in `c`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not match it. The template can have either lowercase or uppercase letters. If the template has a lowercase letter at a certain position, the corresponding letter in the string must be the same. If the template has an uppercase letter, the corresponding letter in the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template letter.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the length of the strings `n`.
   - It reads the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It then iterates through each position `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
     - If both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, it sets `l` to `'YES'`.
     - If the loop completes without setting `l` to `'YES'`, it sets `l` to `'NO'`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `l`.

### Issues in the Solution:
1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The program checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for each position `i`. However, it does not check if there is any position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template while `c[i]` does not match the template. The program should ensure that there exists at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` can be matched by the template but `c[i]` cannot.
2. **Variable `l` Initialization**: The variable `l` is initialized to `'YES'` outside the loop, but it should be reset to `'NO'` at the start of each test case to ensure it correctly reflects the result for each test case.
3. **Incorrect Overwriting of `l`**: If the program finds a position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, it sets `l` to `'YES'`. However, if it encounters a position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template but `c[i]` does not, it should immediately print `'YES'` and break out of the loop. The current logic incorrectly sets `l` to `'NO'` in the `else` clause of the `for` loop, which is executed only if the loop completes without a `break` statement, which is not the intended behavior.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it while string `c` does not match it.

Correctness: **False**
