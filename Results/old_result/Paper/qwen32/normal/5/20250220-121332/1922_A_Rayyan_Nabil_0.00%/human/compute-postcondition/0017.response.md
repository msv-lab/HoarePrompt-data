To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and the described output states after the first few iterations.

The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration `i`, it checks if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If this condition is met for any iteration, `l` remains 'YES'. If this condition is not met for any iteration, `l` will be set to 'NO' after the loop completes.

From the output states after the first 3 iterations, it is clear that `l` remains 'YES' as long as the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` holds true for any `i` during the iterations. If this condition fails for all iterations, `l` will be set to 'NO'.

Thus, after all iterations, the final value of `l` is determined by whether there was at least one iteration where `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` was true. If such an iteration exists, `l` will be 'YES'; otherwise, it will be 'NO'.

**Output State: **l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `l` will be 'YES' if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c` at the same index. If this condition is not met for any index, `l` will be 'NO'.
