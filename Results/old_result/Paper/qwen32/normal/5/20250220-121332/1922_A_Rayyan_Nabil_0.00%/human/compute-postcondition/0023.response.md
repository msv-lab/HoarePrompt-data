The value of `c` is assigned the result of `input()`, which means `c` now holds the value of whatever string is input by the user. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i (0 <= i < n) such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]; otherwise, l is 'NO', `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string, `b` is the input string, `c` is an input string.**
