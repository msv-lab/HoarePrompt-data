Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length `n`. For each test case, it determines if every character in string `c` matches at least one of the corresponding characters in strings `a` or `b`. It prints 'YES' if this condition is met for all characters in `c`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
