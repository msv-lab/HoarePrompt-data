The code snippet provided is simply `l = 'YES'`. This line of code assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `l`. However, the initial state already specifies that `l` remains `'YES'`. Therefore, the value of `l` does not change.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are new input strings, `i` is `i + 1`, and `l` remains 'YES'.**
