Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are new input strings, `i` is `i + 1`, and `l` remains 'YES'. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, the conditions on `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged.**
