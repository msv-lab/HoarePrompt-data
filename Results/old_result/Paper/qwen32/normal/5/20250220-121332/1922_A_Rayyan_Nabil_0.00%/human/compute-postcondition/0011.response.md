The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `i_prev + 1`. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the exact value of `i`, we can assume that `i` was `i_prev` and now it should be `i_prev + 1`. However, since we do not have the exact value of `i_prev`, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are new input strings, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `l` remains 'YES'**
