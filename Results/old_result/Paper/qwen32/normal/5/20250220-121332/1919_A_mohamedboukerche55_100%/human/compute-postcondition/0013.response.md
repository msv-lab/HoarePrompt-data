The code snippet provided is `b = int(list(s.split())[1])`. This line of code splits the input string `s` into a list of substrings, then converts the second element of this list (index 1) into an integer and assigns it to `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the new input string.
- `a` is the integer value of the first element in the new input string `s`.
- `b` is the integer value of the second element in the new input string `s`.
- `t` is greater than `i + 1`.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.

After executing the code snippet, the value of `b` will be updated to the integer value of the second element of the split input string `s`. The values of `a`, `s`, `t`, and the condition regarding the sum of `a` and `b` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is the new input string; `a` is the integer value of the first element in the new input string `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second element in the new input string `s`; `t` is greater than `i + 1`; the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.**
