Let's analyze the problem description, the provided program, and the function summary to verify the correctness of the solution.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game where they take turns.
- Each turn, a player can either swap wallets or keep the current one and then remove one coin.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- The winner is determined based on the total number of coins in both wallets.

### Key Insight:
- **Even Total Coins (a + b) % 2 == 0**: Bob wins.
- **Odd Total Coins (a + b) % 2 != 0**: Alice wins.

### Explanation:
- If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he will always have a move after Alice.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by ensuring that after her moves, Bob is left with an even total number of coins.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks if the total number of coins is even or odd and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

### Function Summary:
- The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It prints "Bob" if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, and "Alice" if `(a + b) % 2 != 0`.

### Verification:
The logic in the program matches the key insight derived from the game analysis:
- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, the program correctly prints "Bob".
- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, the program correctly prints "Alice".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the total number of coins being even or odd, which determines the winner under optimal play.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
