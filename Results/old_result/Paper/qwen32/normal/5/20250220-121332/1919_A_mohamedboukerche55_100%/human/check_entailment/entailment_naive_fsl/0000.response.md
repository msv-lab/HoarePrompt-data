Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the described rules. The winning strategy is not accurately captured by the logic `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.

To determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets, but the decision should be based on whether the total number of coins is odd or even, and who goes first. Specifically:

- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins because she can always force Bob into a losing position.
- If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins because Alice will eventually be forced into a position where she cannot make a move.

The current implementation only checks the parity of the sum and does not consider the optimal play strategy for both players, which is critical for determining the winner.

Here is a test case that demonstrates the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Alice
```

In this case, the sum of coins is 4 (even), so Bob should win according to the rules, but the program incorrectly outputs "Alice". This demonstrates that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy.
