Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case contains two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively; `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    a = int(list(s.split())[0])
    b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is the integer value of the first element in the input string `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second element in the input string `s`; `t` is greater than or equal to 1; `s` is the input string; the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is the new input string; `a` is the integer value of the first element in the new input string `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second element in the new input string `s`; `t` is greater than `i + 1`; the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the code follows the if part. Otherwise, it follows the else part. In both cases, the values of `s`, `a`, `b`, `t`, and `i` retain their initial states with respect to the conditions given.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the new input string; `a` is the integer value of the first element in `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second element in `s`; `t` is greater than `i + 1`; the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
