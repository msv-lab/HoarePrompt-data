Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer from the input, `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions, `i` is 4, `position` is the position of the 5th element in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the 5th element in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values except for `bullets_needed`, which is now equal to the `health` of the 5th element in the `monsters` list.
