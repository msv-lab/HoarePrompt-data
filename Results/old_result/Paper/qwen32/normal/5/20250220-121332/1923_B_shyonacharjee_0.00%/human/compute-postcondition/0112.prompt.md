Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 3 · 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 2 · 10^9; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for each `i`; `x` is a list of `n` integers such that -`n` ≤ `x_1` < `x_2` < ... < `x_n` ≤ `n` and `x_i` ≠ 0 for each `i`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
    positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
    total_bullets_used = 0
    success = True
    for i in range(n):
        position, health = monsters[i]
        distance = abs(position)
        time_available = distance
        bullets_needed = health
        if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
            success = False
            break
        total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
    print('YES' if success else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1; `n` and `k` are integers from the input; `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of the monsters processed; `success` is True if all monsters were processed without exceeding the time available, otherwise False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `n`, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `healths` remains the same, `positions` remains the same, `monsters` remains the same, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters if the loop completes all iterations, otherwise, it is the sum of the health values up to the point where the loop breaks, `success` is `True` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise, it is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `n` + 1; `n` and `k` are new input integers; `healths` is a list of integers read from the input; `positions` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters if `success` is `True`; `success` is `True` if `total_bullets_used` never exceeded `time_available` for any monster; otherwise, `success` is `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
