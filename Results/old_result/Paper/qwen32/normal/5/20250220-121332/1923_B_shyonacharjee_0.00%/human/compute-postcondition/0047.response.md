Output State: **`t` is at least 1 and is decremented by 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the new input; `positions` is a list of integers from the new input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True; `position` is the position value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `health` is the health value from the `i`-th tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is `abs(position)`.**

In simpler terms, the variable `distance` has been assigned the value of the absolute value of `position`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
