Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer from the input, `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions, `i` is 4, `position` is the position of the 5th element in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the 5th element in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains as described without any changes to `success` or breaking out of the loop.**
