The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then maps each string to an integer, effectively converting the input into a list of integers. This list of integers is then assigned to the variable `healths`.

Given the initial state, `healths` was previously a list from the input, but the code snippet reassigns it to a new list of integers derived from the current input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `positions`, `monsters`, `total_bullets_used`, and `success`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1 and is decremented by 1; `n` and `k` are integers from the input; `healths` is a list of integers from the new input; `positions` is a list from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of the monsters processed; `success` is True if all monsters were processed without exceeding the time available, otherwise False.**
