Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `n` + 1; `n` is greater than 0; `k` is a new input integer; `healths` is a list of integers read from the input; `positions` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and a health value, sorted by the absolute value of the position; `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`; `position` is the position value from the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`; `health` is the health value from the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`; `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`; `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, `success` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**
