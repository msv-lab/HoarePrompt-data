Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1; `n` and `k` are integers from the input; `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `total_bullets_used` is 0; `success` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer from the input; `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input; `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions; `position` and `health` are the `i`-th tuple values from `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`; `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`; `bullets_needed` is `health`; `total_bullets_used` is updated by adding `bullets_needed`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer from the input, `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions, `i` is incremented by 1, `position` is the position from the `i`th tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the health from the `i`th tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, then `success` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer from the input, `healths` and `positions` are lists from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of (position, health) tuples based on the absolute value of positions, `i` is 4, `position` is the position of the 5th element in `monsters`, `health` is the health of the 5th element in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
