You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters within the constraints given. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers representing the health of monsters, and a list `x` of `n` integers representing the positions of the monsters. The function outputs 'YES' if it is possible to defeat all monsters using the bullets within the time constraints, otherwise it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the problem description in all cases. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the player can shoot multiple bullets in a single second, and these bullets can be directed at different monsters. The program only checks if the total bullets used up to a certain monster exceed the time available for that monster, but it does not consider the possibility of shooting multiple monsters in the same second.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
- During the 1st second, you can fire 1 bullet at the 1st monster and 1 bullet at the 3rd monster. The 1st monster dies, and the 2nd and 3rd monsters move closer.
- During the 2nd second, you can fire 2 bullets at the 2nd monster. The 2nd monster dies, and the 3rd monster moves closer.
- During the 3rd second, you can fire 2 bullets at the 3rd monster. The 3rd monster dies.

However, the program will fail for this case because it does not correctly account for the ability to shoot multiple monsters in the same second. The program will incorrectly determine that it is not possible to kill the monsters in time.

To fix this, the program should consider the total number of bullets available per second and distribute them optimally among the monsters that are closest and need to be killed first. The current implementation does not do this and only checks the cumulative bullets used against the time available for each monster individually, which is not the correct approach.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
1 1
-1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Program Output:**
```
NO
```

In this case, the player can shoot one bullet at each monster in the first second, killing both before they move closer. However, the program will incorrectly conclude that it is not possible to kill both monsters in time because it does not account for the ability to shoot multiple monsters in the same second.
