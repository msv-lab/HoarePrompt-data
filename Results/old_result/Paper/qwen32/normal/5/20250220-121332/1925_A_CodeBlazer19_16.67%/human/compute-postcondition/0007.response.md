The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 before this code snippet is executed, so `j` is now `j + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676; `n` is an integer provided by the input; `k` must be at least 0; `j` is `j + 2`; `s` is updated to include the character `chr(j + 1)` appended to it.**
