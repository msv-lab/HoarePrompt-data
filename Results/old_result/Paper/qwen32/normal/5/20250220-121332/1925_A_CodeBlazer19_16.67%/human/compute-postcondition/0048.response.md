Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It constructs a string `s` of `k` consecutive lowercase letters starting from 'a'. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. Otherwise, it prints the string `s` repeated twice if `n` is greater than 1, or just once if `n` is 1.**
