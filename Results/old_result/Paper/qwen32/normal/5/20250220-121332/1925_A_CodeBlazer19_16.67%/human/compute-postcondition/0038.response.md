To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `j` and `k` in this case.

Given:
- The loop runs for `j` in the range from 97 to `k + 97`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 6.

Since the loop iterates over `j` from 97 to `k + 97`, `j` must be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 98 (the next value after 97).

The value of `k` does not change during the loop, so it remains as it is.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is 'AF', and `j` is 98**
