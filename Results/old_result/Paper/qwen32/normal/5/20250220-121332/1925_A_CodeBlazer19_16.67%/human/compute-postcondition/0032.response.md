Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `s` is a string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, and `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
