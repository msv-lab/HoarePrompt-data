The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `k`. The loop will execute if the range function generates at least one value, which depends on the value of `k`. Specifically, the loop will execute if `k + 97` is greater than 97, meaning `k` must be at least 0.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 0 for the loop to execute. The variables `t` and `s` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `k` is at least 0.

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676; `n` is an integer provided by the input; `k` must be at least 0; `s` is an empty string**
