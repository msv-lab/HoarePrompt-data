The only variable in the loop head is `j`. According to the loop statement, `j` iterates from 97 to `k + 96` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 98. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `k` must be such that `j` is still within the range.

Given that `j` is 98 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be 99. The value of `k` must be at least 3 (since `99` should be less than or equal to `k + 96`, which implies `k >= 3`).

State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 676, `n` is the first integer provided by the input, `k` must be at least 3, `s` is a string 'bb', `i` is 4, `j` is 99**
