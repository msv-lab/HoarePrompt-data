Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing the current character `char`; `letters` is an empty list. The current character `char` is a digit.**

In simple terms, the `digits` list now contains the current character `char`, which is a digit. The `password`, `letters`, and `n` remain unchanged.
