The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `last_digit_index`. Given that `i` is 0, `last_digit_index` will also be set to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character of `password` and is a digit, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear, `last_digit_index` is 0**.
