The code appends `char` to the `letters` list. Given the initial state, if `char` was a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` was initially an empty list and `digits` was a list containing `char`. After the code execution, `letters` will contain `char` and `digits` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `char` is the next character in the `password` string; `digits` is a list containing `char` if `char` was a digit, otherwise `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is a list containing `char`.**
