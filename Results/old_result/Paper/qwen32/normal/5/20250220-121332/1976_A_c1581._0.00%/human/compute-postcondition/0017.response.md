The provided code snippet only initializes a variable `last_digit_index` to `-1` and does not modify any of the other variables (`password`, `digits`, `letters`, or `n`). Therefore, the values of `password`, `digits`, `letters`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear; `last_digit_index` is -1.**
