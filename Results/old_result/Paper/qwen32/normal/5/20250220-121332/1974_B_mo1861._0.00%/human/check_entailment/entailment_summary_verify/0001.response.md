### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - We need to decode a string `b` to get the original string `s`.
   - The decoding involves reversing the encoding process where each character in `s` was replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r` (which is the sorted set of unique characters from `s`).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
   - The function `func_1` is called to decode the string `b`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function first creates a set of characters from `b` to get all distinct characters.
   - It then sorts these characters alphabetically to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - The program attempts to create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to a character in the reversed alphabet order (i.e., `c -> 'a' + (len(b) - i - 1)`). This is incorrect as per the problem description.
   - The function then uses this incorrect mapping to decode the string `b`.

4. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary incorrectly states that the mapping should be to characters in the reversed alphabet order.
   - The correct mapping should be from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., `r[i] -> r[len(r) - i - 1]`).

5. **Correct Mapping:**
   - The correct mapping should map each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`.
   - For example, if `r` is `"cdefors"`, the correct mapping should be:
     - `c -> s`
     - `d -> r`
     - `e -> e`
     - `f -> f`
     - `o -> o`
     - `r -> d`
     - `s -> c`

6. **Program Correction:**
   - The program should create the mapping `char_map` such that `char_map[r[i]] = r[len(r) - i - 1]`.
   - The corrected version of the program is as follows:
     ```python
     num_test_cases = int(input())
     for _ in range(num_test_cases):
         num_chars = int(input())
         b = input()
         print(func_1(b))

     def func_1(b):
         """
         Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

         Args:
             b (str): The encoded string.

         Returns:
             str: The decoded string s.
         """
         r = sorted(set(b))
         char_map = {r[i]: r[len(r) - i - 1] for i in range(len(r))}
         s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
         return s
     ```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect mapping process. The mapping should map each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`, not to characters in the reversed alphabet order.

**Final:** **False**
