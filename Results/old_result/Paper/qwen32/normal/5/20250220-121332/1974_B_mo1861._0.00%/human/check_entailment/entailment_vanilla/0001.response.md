Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string as per the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Constructing the Auxiliary String `r`:**
   - `r` is formed by taking all distinct characters from the original string `s` and sorting them alphabetically.
   
2. **Encoding Process:**
   - Each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from `r`. 
   - The first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second character of `r` is replaced by the second last, and so on.

3. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the mapping done during encoding.
   - We need to map each character in the encoded string `b` back to its original character in `s` using the reverse of the encoding process.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Creating the Mapping:**
   - The program first creates a set of characters from the encoded string `b` to get all distinct characters.
   - It then sorts these characters alphabetically to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character in the reversed alphabet order.

2. **Decoding the String:**
   - The program then uses the created mapping to decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Mapping:**
  - The mapping created in the program is incorrect. 
  - The mapping should map each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`, not to characters in the reversed alphabet order.
  - For example, if `r` is `"cdefors"`, the mapping should be:
    - `c -> s`
    - `d -> r`
    - `e -> e`
    - `f -> f`
    - `o -> o`
    - `r -> d`
    - `s -> c`
  - But the program maps `c` to `'a' + (len(b) - i - 1)`, which is incorrect.

### Correct Mapping:
- The correct mapping should be:
  - `r[i] -> r[len(r) - i - 1]` for each character in `r`.

### Correct Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    r = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {r[i]: r[len(r) - i - 1] for i in range(len(r))}
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect mapping process.

Correctness: **False**
