The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over each character in the string `b`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `c` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

Given:
- `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character `c` in the sorted set of `b` is a key, and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of `c` in the sorted set of `b`.
- `s` is the original `s` concatenated with `char_map[c]`.
- `b` must be a string with at least one character.
- `c` is the second-to-last character in `b`.

Since `c` is the second-to-last character in `b` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `c` in the loop should be the last character in `b`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `c` should be the last character in `b`.

State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character `c` in the sorted set of `b` is a key, and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of `c` in the sorted set of `b`; `s` is the original `s` concatenated with `char_map[c]`; `b` must be a string with at least one character; `c` is the last character in `b`**
