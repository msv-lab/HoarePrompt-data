Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to decode the given string `b` by mapping each unique character in `b` to a corresponding character from the end of the alphabet, starting with 'z'. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not accurately reverse the encoding process described in the problem statement.

The encoding process involves creating a string `r` of distinct characters from `s`, sorted in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`. To decode, we need to reverse this process: create the string `r` from `b` by identifying the distinct characters and sorting them, and then replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character from `r`.

The current implementation incorrectly maps the smallest character in `b` to 'z', the second smallest to 'y', and so on. Instead, it should map the smallest character in `b` to the largest character in `r`, the second smallest to the second largest in `r`, and so on.

Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    reverse_map = {r[i]: r[-i-1] for i in range(len(r))}
    s = ''.join(reverse_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

This corrected function first creates the string `r` from `b` by identifying the distinct characters and sorting them. It then creates a mapping `reverse_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character from `r`. Finally, it constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `reverse_map`.

Given the execution summary and the provided program, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly reverse the encoding process.

Correctness: **False**
