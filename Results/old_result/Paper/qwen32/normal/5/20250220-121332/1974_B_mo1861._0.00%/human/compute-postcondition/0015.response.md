Output State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character `c` in the sorted set of `b` is a key, and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of `c` in the sorted set of `b`; `s` is the original `s` concatenated with `char_map[c]` and then concatenated with `char_map[c]` again; `b` must be a string with at least one character; `c` is the last character in `b`**

In simpler terms, the string `s` has been updated to include `char_map[c]` one more time at the end, while `char_map` and `b` remain unchanged.
