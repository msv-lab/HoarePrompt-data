### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to decode a string `b` that was encoded using the method described in the problem statement. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and whether it correctly implements the decoding process:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b`:
     - **Step 1:** It creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
     - **Step 2:** It constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character `c` in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character from the end of the alphabet. Specifically, the first character in the sorted set is mapped to the last character in the alphabet, the second to the second last, and so on.
     - **Step 3:** It constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value from `char_map`.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The mapping in `char_map` is incorrect. The mapping should be such that the first character in the sorted set is mapped to the last character in the sorted set, the second to the second last, and so on. However, the provided code incorrectly maps the characters to positions starting from 'a' and moving forward, which is not the intended behavior.
   - The correct way to map characters is to map the first character in the sorted set to the last character in the sorted set, the second to the second last, and so on. This can be achieved by using the sorted set directly for both the keys and the values in reverse order.

### Correct Implementation:

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i - 1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    return s
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect mapping of characters in `char_map`. The corrected version of the program is provided above.

**Correctness: False**

However, if the intention was to use the provided code with the understanding that the characters should be mapped to the end of the alphabet, then the original code is incorrect as it does not achieve the desired mapping.

**Correctness: False**
