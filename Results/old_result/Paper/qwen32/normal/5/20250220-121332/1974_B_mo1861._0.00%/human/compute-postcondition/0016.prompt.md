Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character `c` in the sorted set of `b` is a key, and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of `c` in the sorted set of `b`; `s` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for c in b:
    s += char_map[c]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character `c` in the sorted set of `b` is a key, and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of `c` in the sorted set of `b`; `s` is `char_map[c]`; `b` must be a string with at least one character

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character `c` in the sorted set of `b` is a key, and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of `c` in the sorted set of `b`; `s` is the original `s` concatenated with `char_map[c]`; `b` must be a string with at least one character; `c` is the second-to-last character in `b`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character `c` in the sorted set of `b` is a key, and the value is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of `c` in the sorted set of `b`; `s` is the original `s` concatenated with `char_map[c]` and then concatenated with `char_map[c]` again; `b` must be a string with at least one character; `c` is the last character in `b`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
