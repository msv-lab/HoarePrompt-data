The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program flow. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input.**
