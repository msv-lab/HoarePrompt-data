The code snippet creates a new list `l11` that contains all elements from `l1` except for the elements that are equal to `a2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged. The only change is the creation of `l11`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, if `m` is 1, the current value of `m` remains 1. Otherwise, `m` retains its original value; `a1` is the first integer read from the input; `l1` is a list of integers read from the input following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`.**
