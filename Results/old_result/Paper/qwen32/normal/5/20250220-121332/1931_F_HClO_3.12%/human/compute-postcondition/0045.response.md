Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` and `idx2` retain their previous values, and either `p1` is set to 1 and `p2` is set to 0, or `p1` is set to 0 and `p2` is set to 1, unless `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, in which case the loop is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, then `idx1` is set to `i`, `idx2` is set to `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
