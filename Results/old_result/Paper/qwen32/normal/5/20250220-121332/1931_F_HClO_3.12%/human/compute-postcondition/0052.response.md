The code snippet provided sets the value of `p1` to 1. No other variables are directly modified in this snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, and the condition for breaking out of the loop all remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; `idx1` is equal to `i`; `p1` is 1.**
