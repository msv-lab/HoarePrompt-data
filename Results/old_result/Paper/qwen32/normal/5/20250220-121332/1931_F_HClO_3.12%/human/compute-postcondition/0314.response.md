Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 6, `m` are integers provided by the input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line with all occurrences of `a2` removed to form `l11`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` with all occurrences of `a1` removed, and `i` is 5. If `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
