Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` and `l22` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `idx1` and `idx2` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains at least one more tuple `(a3_new, l3_new)`, `l` is updated based on the last iteration's conditions and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain the same. The variables `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions. The code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
