Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input where `m` must be greater than 2; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; the current lists `l11` and `l22` are not equal. The loop continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop continues executing.
