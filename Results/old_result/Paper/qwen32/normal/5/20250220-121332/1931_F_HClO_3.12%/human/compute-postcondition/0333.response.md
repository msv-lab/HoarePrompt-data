The code snippet `l = l1` assigns the list `l1` to the variable `l`. This means that `l` now refers to the same list object that `l1` refers to. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the same, `m` is 2 if the initial `m` was 2, otherwise `m` remains the same, `a1` is the same, `a2` is the same, `l2` is the same, `l22` is the same, `idx1` and `idx2` are set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` if such a pair is found, otherwise they are -1, `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` were encountered, otherwise they are 0, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first integer from the input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers. Additionally, the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`. `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. `l` is now the same as `l1`.**
