To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which in this case is only `_`. The loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `_` is `m-3` if `l11 != l22`, otherwise `_` is `0`. Since the loop is iterating `m-2` times, the value of `_` at the start of each iteration will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the current value of `_`**: From the state description, `_` is either `m-3` or `0` at the end of the previous iteration.
2. **Determine the new value of `_`**: Since the loop increments `_` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `_` at the start of the next iteration will be the current value of `_` plus 1.

Let's consider both cases for `_`:

- If `_` was `m-3` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `m-3 + 1 = m-2`.
- If `_` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.

However, since the loop iterates `m-2` times, the value of `_` will start from `0` and increment by 1 each time until it reaches `m-3`. Therefore, the next value of `_` must be `0 + 1 = 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer greater than 2; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, with `a1` inserted at `idx2` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, with `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a2` in `l3` is less than or equal to the index of `a1` in `l3`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2` (before the insertion); `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-1`; `idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `p1` and `p2` are set based on the last iteration if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`; `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)` appended to the previous contents of `val`; `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from `l2` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, or `l` is a list of integers from `l1` if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `_` is 1; `idx1` is less than `idx2` if `idx1` was less than `idx2` initially, otherwise `idx1` is not less than `idx2`; the loop has not printed 'yes' or 'no' yet; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a3`**
