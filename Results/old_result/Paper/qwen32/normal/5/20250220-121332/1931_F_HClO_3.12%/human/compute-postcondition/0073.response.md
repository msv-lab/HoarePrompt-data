Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, no changes are made to `idx1` and `idx2`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
