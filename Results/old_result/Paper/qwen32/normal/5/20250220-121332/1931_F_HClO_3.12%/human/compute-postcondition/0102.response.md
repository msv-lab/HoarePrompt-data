Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` must be at least 3; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`, with `a1` inserted at index `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3` or `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`, with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3` or `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l2` remains unchanged; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is `n-2` or the index where the loop broke early; `idx1` and `idx2` are the indices where `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` or `-1` if no such pair is found; `p1` and `p2` are `1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1` was encountered, otherwise `0`; `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`; `a3` is the first integer from the new input line; `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a3`; `l` is a list equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2` with `a2` inserted at the position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3` or `a2` is not in `l3` or `a1` is not in `l3`.** The variable `val` has been updated to include the new tuple `(a3, l3)`.
