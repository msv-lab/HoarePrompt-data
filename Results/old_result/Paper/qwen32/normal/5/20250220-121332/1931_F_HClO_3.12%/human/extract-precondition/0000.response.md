Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the k lines following the description of each test case contains n distinct integers a_{ij} each (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n), where a_{i0} is the author of the screenshot and is always at the top of the list. All authors of the screenshots are different.**
