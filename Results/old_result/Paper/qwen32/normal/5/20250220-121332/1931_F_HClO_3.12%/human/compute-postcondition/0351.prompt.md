Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged unless `m` was 2 in which case `m` becomes 1, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` has `a2` inserted at `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`, `l22` remains the same unless `a2` was inserted into `l2` in the else part, `idx1` is incremented by 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it remains the same, `idx2` is `idx2 + 1` if `idx1 < idx2`, otherwise it is reset to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1` if such a pair is found, otherwise it is -1, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` is an empty list if `idx1 <= idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers. If `idx1 > idx2`, `l` becomes `l1`. If `idx1 <= idx2` and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2` and `l` becomes `l1`. Otherwise, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1` and `l` becomes `l2`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` is updated based on conditions, `l22` is updated based on conditions, `idx1` is updated based on conditions, `idx2` is updated based on conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on conditions, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` is updated based on conditions, `l22` is updated based on conditions, `idx1` is updated based on conditions, `idx2` is updated based on conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on conditions, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` is updated based on conditions, `l22` is updated based on conditions, `idx1` is updated based on conditions, `idx2` is updated based on conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains an additional tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on conditions, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
