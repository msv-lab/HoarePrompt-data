Let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

The print statement in the code is:
```python
print('no')
```

The string `'no'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement. This means that regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, and `_`, the output of the `print` statement will always be the string `'no'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **no**
