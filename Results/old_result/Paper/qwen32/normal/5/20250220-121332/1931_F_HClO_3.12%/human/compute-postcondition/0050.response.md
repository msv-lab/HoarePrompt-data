Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the first input line; `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line following `a1`; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line following `a2`; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any instances of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`; `i` is incremented by 1; `idx1` is equal to `i`; `idx2` is equal to `i`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, and `l22` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making `idx1` and `idx2` equal to the new value of `i`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
