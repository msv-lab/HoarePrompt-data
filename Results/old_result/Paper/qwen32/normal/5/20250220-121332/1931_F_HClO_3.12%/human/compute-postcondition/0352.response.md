In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over the elements of the `val` list, which contains `m - 2` tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`. 

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to make sure that `val` has at least one element, as the loop will only execute if `val` is not empty. The variables `a3` and `l3` are loop variables that will take on the values of the tuples in `val` during each iteration. Since `a3` and `l3` are loop variables, we do not need to adjust their states before the loop starts.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `val` to ensure that it contains at least one tuple. 

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain the same, `l2` and `l22` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `idx1` and `idx2` are updated based on the last iteration's conditions, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, `val` contains at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is updated based on the last iteration's conditions**
