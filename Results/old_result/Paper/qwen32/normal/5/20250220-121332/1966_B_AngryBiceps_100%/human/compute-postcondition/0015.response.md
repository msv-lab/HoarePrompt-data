The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the `first_row` string.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is an integer read from the input
- `a` is a list containing three elements (the original input string, the previously appended input string, and the newly appended input string)
- `first_row` is the concatenation of the original first character of the input string and the first character of the newly appended input string
- `last_row` is the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the newly appended input string
- `i` is incremented by 1

The value of `first_row` will be updated by appending the first character of the last element in the list `a`.

Thus, the updated `first_row` will be the original `first_row` concatenated with the first character of the last element of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list containing three elements (the original input string, the previously appended input string, and the newly appended input string), `first_row` is the concatenation of the original `first_row` and the first character of the last element of `a`, `last_row` is the concatenation of the original `last_row` and the last character of the newly appended input string, `i` is incremented by 1.**
