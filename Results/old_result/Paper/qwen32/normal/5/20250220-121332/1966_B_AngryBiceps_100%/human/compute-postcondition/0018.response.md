Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string); `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together. The first element of `a` consists of identical characters, and the last element of `a` consists of identical characters, but the first and last elements of `a` are not the same.**
