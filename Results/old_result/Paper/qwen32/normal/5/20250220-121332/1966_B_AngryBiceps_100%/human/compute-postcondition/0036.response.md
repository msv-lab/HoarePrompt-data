The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value (which is not specified, but we know it was less than `n` to have entered the loop), and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i`.

Since the task specifies only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the only change needed is to increment `i` by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing one element which is the string input from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a`, `i` is incremented by 1**
