Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a string input from the user), `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each string in `a` concatenated in order, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each string in `a` concatenated in order.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all `n` iterations:
- `t` remains the same as it was initially.
- `n` remains the same as it was initially, indicating the number of iterations.
- `m` remains the same as it was initially, as it is not modified by the loop.
- `a` is a list containing `n` strings, each string being an input from the user.
- `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each string in `a`.
