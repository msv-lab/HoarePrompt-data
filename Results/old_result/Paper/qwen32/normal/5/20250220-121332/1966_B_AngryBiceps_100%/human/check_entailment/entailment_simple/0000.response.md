### Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine if all squares in an n x m grid can be made the same color using the specified operations. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions `n` and `m`, and then reads the grid itself, storing the first and last columns in `first_row` and `last_row`, respectively.

2. **Checking Conditions**:
   - It checks if all characters in the first and last rows are identical and different from each other (`len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]`). If true, it prints "NO".
   - It checks if all characters in the first and last columns are identical and different from each other (`len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row`). If true, it prints "NO".
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Analysis of the Conditions:

- **First and Last Rows**: If the first and last rows are identical and different from each other, it implies that the entire grid cannot be made the same color because there is a clear distinction between the first and last rows, and no operation can bridge this distinction.
  
- **First and Last Columns**: Similarly, if the first and last columns are identical and different from each other, it implies that the entire grid cannot be made the same color because there is a clear distinction between the first and last columns, and no operation can bridge this distinction.

- **Otherwise**: If neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are identical and different from each other, it means that there is a possibility to make the entire grid the same color by performing the specified operations.

### Conclusion:

The logic of the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided conditions. It correctly identifies scenarios where it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color and correctly identifies scenarios where it is possible.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
