The variable `first_row` is assigned an empty string. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string.**
