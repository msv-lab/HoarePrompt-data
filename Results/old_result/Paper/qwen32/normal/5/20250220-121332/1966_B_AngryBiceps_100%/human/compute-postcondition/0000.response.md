In the provided task, the for loop iterates over a range defined by the integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and the `int(input())` expression. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is the value of `t`. 

Given that `t` is already described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is already in a state that ensures the loop will execute at least once if it is within this range. However, to explicitly define the state before the loop starts in the required format, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed within this range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This state ensures that the loop will execute `t` times, as required by the problem statement.
