The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `last_row` and assigns it an empty string. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`) are affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.**
