Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500. The grid is represented by n lines, each containing m characters which are either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = []
    first_row = ''
    last_row = ''
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(input())
        first_row += a[-1][0]
        last_row += a[-1][-1]
    if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        print('NO')
    elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
        ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from the input; `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string); `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together. If the first element of `a` consists of identical characters, the last element of `a` consists of identical characters, and they are not the same, then the conditions of the if part hold. Otherwise, at least one of the following is true: the first string in `a` does not consist of all identical characters, the last string in `a` does not consist of all identical characters, or the first and last strings in `a` are the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a string input from the user), `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each string in `a` concatenated in order, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each string in `a` concatenated in order. If the first string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, the last string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, and the first string in `a` is not the same as the last string in `a`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` does not consist of a single character, or the last string in `a` does not consist of a single character, or the first string in `a` is the same as the last string in `a`. Additionally, if `first_row` consists of identical characters, `last_row` consists of identical characters, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or the length of the set of characters in `last_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer greater than 0; `m` is an integer read from input; `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being a string input from the user; `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each string in `a` concatenated together; `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each string in `a` concatenated together; `i` is `n`. If the first string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, the last string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, and the first string in `a` is not equal to the last string in `a`, then the if block executes. Otherwise, the else block executes, where at least one of the following is true: the first string in `a` does not consist of a single character, the last string in `a` does not consist of a single character, or the first and last strings in `a` are the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
