Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer read from the new input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is a string input from the user), `first_row` is a string containing the first character of each string in `a` concatenated in order, `last_row` is a string containing the last character of each string in `a` concatenated in order. If the first string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, the last string in `a` consists of the same character repeated, and the first string in `a` is not the same as the last string in `a`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` does not consist of a single character, or the last string in `a` does not consist of a single character, or the first string in `a` is the same as the last string in `a`. Additionally, if `first_row` consists of identical characters, `last_row` consists of identical characters, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`, then the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or the length of the set of characters in `last_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
