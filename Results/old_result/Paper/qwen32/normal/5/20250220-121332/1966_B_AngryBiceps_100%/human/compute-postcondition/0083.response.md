Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of a grid (n x m) and the grid itself, which consists of 'W' and 'B' characters. It then determines if the first and last rows of the grid are identical or if the first and last columns are identical and not the same. If either condition is true, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.**
