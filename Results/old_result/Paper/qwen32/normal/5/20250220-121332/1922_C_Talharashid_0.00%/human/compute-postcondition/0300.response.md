Output State: **`t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4); `i` remains the same (2*m + 1); `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration; `d2` remains unchanged (a new defaultdict with default int values); `n` remains the same (input integer); `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input); `end` remains the same (len(lst) - 1); `inc` remains the same (1); `m` remains the same (input integer); `start` is now `end` (len(lst) - 1); `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration; `s` is the accumulated value based on the differences calculated in each iteration.**

In simple terms, the variable `start` has been updated to be equal to `end`, which is `len(lst) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
