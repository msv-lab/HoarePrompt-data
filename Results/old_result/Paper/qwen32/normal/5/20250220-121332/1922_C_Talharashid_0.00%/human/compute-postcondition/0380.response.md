Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of cities, a list `a` of `n` integers in ascending order representing the coordinates of the cities, an integer `m` representing the number of queries, and for each query, two integers `x_i` and `y_i` representing the indices of two different cities. The function returns the index of the city that is closest to city `x_i` for the first query, the index of the city that is closest to city `y_i` for the second query, and so on for all queries. Each city's closest city is uniquely determined.**
