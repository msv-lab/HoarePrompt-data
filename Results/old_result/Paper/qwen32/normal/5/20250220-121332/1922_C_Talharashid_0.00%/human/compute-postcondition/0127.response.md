The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the loop variable in the `range(t)`. According to the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. 

Given that `i` is `m - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `m`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the value read from the input in the last iteration minus 1, `end` is the value read from the input in the last iteration minus 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
