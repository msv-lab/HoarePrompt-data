Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 0 to `end - 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least one element, `start` is 1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0, `mini` is 11111111, and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.**
