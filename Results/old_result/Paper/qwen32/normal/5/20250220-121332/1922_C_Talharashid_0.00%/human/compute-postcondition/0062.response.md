Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, and `mini` is the minimum of 11111111 and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
