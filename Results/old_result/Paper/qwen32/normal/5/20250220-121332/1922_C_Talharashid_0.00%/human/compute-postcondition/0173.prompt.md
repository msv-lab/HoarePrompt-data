Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers read from the input, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0. If `start` is less than `end`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. `d2` has been reset to a new defaultdict with default int values.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is either 0 or `abs(lst[m] - lst[m + 1])`. If `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` (considering the conditions for `start - 1 > -1` and `start + 1 < len(lst)`), and `s` is set to `abs(lst[m] - lst[m + 1])`. `start` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` (updated), `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `start` is now `start + 1`, `mini` remains unchanged or updated based on the condition, `s` is updated based on the condition.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start - 1] = s` (updated) and `d1[start] = s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `start` is now `start + 1` and must be less than `end - 1`. If `start - 2 > -1`, `mini` is the minimum of `mini` and `abs(lst[start - 1] - lst[start - 2])`. If `mini == abs(lst[start - 1] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start - 1] - lst[start + inc])`. If `start - 2` is not greater than -1, `mini` remains unchanged and `s` is updated based on the condition as described.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
