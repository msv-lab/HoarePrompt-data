The `while` loop condition is `start != end`. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `start` and `end` must have different values right before the loop begins.

Given the state right before the `while` loop:
- `t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4)
- `i` remains the same (2*m + 1)
- `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration
- `d2` remains unchanged (a new defaultdict with default int values)
- `n` remains the same (input integer)
- `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input)
- `end` is 0
- `inc` is now -1
- `m` remains the same (input integer)
- `start` is now `end` (len(lst) - 1)
- `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration
- `s` is 0

The key variables in the loop head are `start` and `end`. According to the provided state, `start` is set to `end` (which is 0), meaning `start` and `end` are currently equal. To make the loop execute, we need to adjust `start` or `end` so that they are not equal.

Since `end` is 0 and `start` is set to `end`, we need to change `start` to a value different from 0. The simplest way to ensure the loop can execute is to set `start` to `len(lst) - 1` directly (as mentioned), but since `start` is already set to `end` (which is 0), we need to change `start` to any value other than 0. 

For the loop to execute, we can set `start` to `len(lst) - 1` (which is the value it is supposed to be according to the problem statement, but it needs to be different from `end` right before the loop starts).

So, we need to adjust `start` to be `len(lst) - 1` and ensure `end` remains 0.

State: **`t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4); `i` remains the same (2*m + 1); `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration; `d2` remains unchanged (a new defaultdict with default int values); `n` remains the same (input integer); `lst` remains the same (list of integers read from the input); `end` is 0; `inc` is now -1; `m` remains the same (input integer); `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration; `s` is 0**
