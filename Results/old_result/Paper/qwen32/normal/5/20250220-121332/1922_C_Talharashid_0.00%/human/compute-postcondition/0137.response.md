Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is 11111111, `m` is the total number of iterations, `s` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `mini` has been updated to 11111111. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
