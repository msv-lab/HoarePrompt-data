To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is set to 2.
- `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values (initially all keys map to 0).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `lst` is a list of integers.
- `start` is the new value read from the input minus 2.
- `end` is the new value read from the input minus 2.
- `inc` is -1.
- `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `s` is 0.
- The values of `s1` and `s2` are determined based on the conditions:
  - If `start` is less than `end`, then:
    - `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`
    - `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`
  - Otherwise, if `start` is greater than or equal to `end`:
    - `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`
    - `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`

### Code Execution:
The code snippet prints `min(s1, s2)`. To understand what this will print, we need to determine the values of `s1` and `s2` based on the initial state.

Since `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, any key that hasn't been explicitly set will map to 0. Therefore:
- If `start` is less than `end`:
  - `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` which simplifies to `abs(0 - 0) = 0` because `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` are both 0.
  - `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` which simplifies to `abs(0 - 0) = 0` because `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` are both 0.
- If `start` is greater than or equal to `end`:
  - `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` which simplifies to `abs(0 - 0) = 0` because `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` are both 0.
  - `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` which simplifies to `abs(0 - 0) = 0` because `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` are both 0.

In both cases, both `s1` and `s2` are 0. Therefore, `min(s1, s2)` will be 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
