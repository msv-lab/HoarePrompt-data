The code snippet increments the value of `start` by `inc`. Given the initial state, `start` is initially `end - 1`, and `inc` is `1`. Therefore, after the execution of `start += inc`, `start` will be `end`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `end`, `inc`, and `mini` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `end`, `mini` is updated to `min(mini, abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]))` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` retains its initial value.**
