Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` (updated), `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `start` is now `start + 1` and must be less than `end - 1`, `mini` is 11111111, `s` is updated based on the condition.**

Explanation: The value of `mini` is set to 11111111. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
