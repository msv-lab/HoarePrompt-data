The code snippet updates the value of `mini` by comparing its current value with the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. 

Given that `mini` was initially set to either 11111111 or the minimum of 11111111 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`, the new value of `mini` will be the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is len(lst) - 1 (which is at least 1), `inc` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `start` must be less than `end`, `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`.**
