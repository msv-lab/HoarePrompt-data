Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the new value read from the input minus 2, `end` is the new value read from the input minus 2, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.**

The value of `s2` has been updated to be the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
