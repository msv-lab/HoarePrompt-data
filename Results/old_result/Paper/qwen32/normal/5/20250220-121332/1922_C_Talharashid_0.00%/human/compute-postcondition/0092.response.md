Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d2[start]` is the cumulative sum `s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` down to 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` and `end` are integers input by the user, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 0**.

In natural language: The variables `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `inc`, `mini`, and `m` retain their initial values. The variables `start` and `end` are updated to the integer values provided by the user input.
