Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is len(lst) - 1 (which is at least 1), `inc` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `mini` is min(abs(lst[0] - lst[1]), 11111111), and `start` is 0. If `start` is at least 1, then the condition `start - 1 > -1` is true, implying that `start` is at least 1. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, then `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and 11111111. If `start` is 0, then the condition `start - 1 > -1` is false, and no additional changes are made to `mini`.**
