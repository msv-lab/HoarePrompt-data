The code snippet provided increments the `start` variable by the value of `inc`. Given the initial state, `inc` is 1, so `start` will increase by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is len(lst) - 1 (which is at least 1), `inc` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `start` is `start + 1`, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and 11111111. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`.**

In simpler terms, the `start` variable is incremented by 1, and all other variables retain their original values.
