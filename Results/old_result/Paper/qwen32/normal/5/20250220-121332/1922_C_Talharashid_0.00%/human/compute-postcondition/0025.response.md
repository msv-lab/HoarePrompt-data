The loop condition is `while start != end`. This means the loop will continue as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` is `start + 1`
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `start` is an integer that has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `start` must still be less than `end` (since `end` is a constant value `len(lst) - 1`).

Therefore, we need to adjust `start` to be less than `end`. The simplest way to ensure this is to set `start` to a value that is one less than `end`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start]` is now `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `start` is `end - 1`, `mini` remains the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start` is greater than 0, `s` remains as it was calculated before the increment.**

This ensures that `start` is not equal to `end`, and thus the loop can execute one more time.
