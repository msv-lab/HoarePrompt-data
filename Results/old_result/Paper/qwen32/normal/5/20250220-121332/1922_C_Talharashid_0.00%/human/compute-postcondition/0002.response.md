The code snippet initializes a defaultdict named `d1` with a default factory of `int`, meaning that any key that does not exist in the dictionary will have a default value of `0`. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values**.
