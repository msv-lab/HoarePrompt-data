The code snippet `end -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `end` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 0, `d1` will have keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `d2` will have keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `1` with corresponding values of `s` calculated in each iteration, `n` remains the same, `lst` remains the same, `end` is the second integer from the input minus 1, `inc` is -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is the first integer from the input minus 1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `s` is the accumulated value based on the conditions described**.
