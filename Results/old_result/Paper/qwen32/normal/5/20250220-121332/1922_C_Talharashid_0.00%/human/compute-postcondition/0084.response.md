The code snippet provided increments the value of `s` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `s`, which is now `s + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values and `d2[start]` is `s + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with more than one element, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111.**
