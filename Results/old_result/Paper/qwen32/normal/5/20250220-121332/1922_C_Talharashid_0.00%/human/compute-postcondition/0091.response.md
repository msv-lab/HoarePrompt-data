To determine the state that ensures the for loop will execute, we must focus on the variables present in the loop head. In the provided for loop:

```python
for i in range(m):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range is determined by `m`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `m` is greater than 0. The initial value of `i` is already given as 0, which is correct for the start of a `range(m)` loop.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 0
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d2[start]` is the cumulative sum `s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` down to 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers
- `start` is 0
- `end` is 0
- `inc` is -1
- `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration
- `m` is an input integer

The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is the value of `m`. It must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d2[start]` is the cumulative sum `s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` down to 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 0**
