Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is `m`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start] = s` (updated), `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `m` is the total number of iterations, `start` is now `start + 1`, `mini` remains unchanged or updated based on the condition, `s` is updated based on the condition.**

In simpler terms, the value of `d1[start]` has been updated to the new value of `s`. The value of `start` has been incremented by 1. The values of `mini` and `s` have been recalculated based on the given conditions, but the rest of the variables remain unchanged.
