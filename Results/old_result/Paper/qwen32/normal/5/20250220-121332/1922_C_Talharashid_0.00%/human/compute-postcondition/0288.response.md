The loop condition for the given `while` loop is `start != end`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `start` must not be equal to `end`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `i` is 2*m + 1
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start]` is `s`
- `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values
- `n` is an input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1` (which is at least 1)
- `inc` is 1
- `m` is the input integer
- `start` is `start + inc`
- `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and if `start - 1 > -1`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `start`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `start` must not be equal to `end`.

Since `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, and `lst` has at least 2 elements, `end` is at least 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `start` must be less than `end`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `start` to be less than `end`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `end` is len(lst) - 1 (which is at least 1), `inc` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `start` must be less than `end`, `mini` is the minimum of 11111111, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and if `start - 1 > -1`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`**
