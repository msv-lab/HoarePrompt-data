Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a defaultdict with default int values where `d2[start]` is the cumulative sum `s` for each `start` from `len(lst) - 1` down to 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `m` is an input integer.**

The variable `m` is assigned the value of the next integer input. All other variables retain their initial values.
