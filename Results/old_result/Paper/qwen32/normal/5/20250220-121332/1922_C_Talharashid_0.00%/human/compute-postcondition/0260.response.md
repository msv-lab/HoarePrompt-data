The value of `inc` is changed from -1 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 2*m + 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default int values, `d2` is a new defaultdict with default int values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers read from the input, `end` is len(lst) - 1, `inc` is 1, `m` is the input integer, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference calculated in the last iteration, `start` is 0.**
