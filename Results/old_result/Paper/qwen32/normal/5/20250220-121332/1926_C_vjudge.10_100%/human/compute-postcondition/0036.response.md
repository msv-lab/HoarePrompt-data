Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that `t` ≥ 1.
2. `inf` is set to 200001.
3. `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000.
4. `i` is set to 200001.
5. `value` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(values[value])
```

### Analysis:
- The list `values` contains 200001 elements, indexed from 0 to 200000.
- `values[i]` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000 is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.
- `value` is an input integer, and the code prints `values[value]`.

### Output Determination:
- The value of `value` is an input integer. To determine what will be printed, we need to know the value of `value`.
- Since `value` is an input integer, we can denote its value as `x` (where `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `x` ≤ 200000 because `values` is indexed from 0 to 200000).
- `values[x]` will be the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `x`.

### Final Output:
The output will be the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `value`.

Output: **values[value] (where values[value] is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to value)**
