The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `inf`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `inf`. Since `inf` is a constant (200001), the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `inf`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `t + 2`.

The states of `t`, `inf`, and `values` do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the continuation of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4), `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 elements where `values[i]` is `sum_value_digits` and all other elements are 0, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `t`**
