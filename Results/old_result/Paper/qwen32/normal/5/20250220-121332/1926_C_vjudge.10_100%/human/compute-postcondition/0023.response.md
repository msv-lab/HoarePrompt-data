The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `inf`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `inf`. If `i` is less than `inf`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` remains unchanged (let's denote its value as `t`).
- `inf` remains 200,001.
- `values[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i`.
- `i` remains `t + 2`.
- `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `i`.

For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `t + 3` (since `i` was `t + 2` at the end of the previous iteration).

The state of `inf` remains unchanged as it is a constant in the loop head.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200,001, `values[i]` is the sum of the digits of `i`, `i` is `t + 3`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `i`**. 

However, since `values[i]` and `sum_value_digits` are not part of the loop head and we are only allowed to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, the final state we need to specify is:

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200,001, `i` is `t + 3`**.
