Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program has a logical error in the function definition and calling order. The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined in the code, which will result in a `NameError` at runtime. 

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
func_1()

def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])
```

To fix this, the function `func_1()` should be defined before it is called. Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])

func_1()
```

With this change, the program should work as expected for all the provided test cases. However, since the original code had a syntax error, it is considered incorrect.
