Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1; `q` is greater than 0; `l` and `r` are integers; `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`; `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. Additionally, the condition (2 * `onesInRange` + (`r` - `l` + 1) - `onesInRange` <= `sumInRange`) holds true if the if block is executed, otherwise, 2 * `onesInRange` + (`r` - `l` + 1) - `onesInRange` > `sumInRange` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1; `q` is greater than 0; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input; `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`; `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If the condition (2 * `onesInRange` + (`r` - `l` + 1) - `onesInRange` <= `sumInRange`) holds true, then the if block executes; otherwise, the else block executes. The condition accurately reflects whether `l` equals `r` or not, maintaining the relationships and values of all variables as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q-1` are integers where 1 <= n, q-1 <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` for all i from 1 to n; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, with each element decremented by 1; `l` and `r` are integers read from the input; `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`; `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If 2 * `onesInRange` + (`r - l + 1`) - `onesInRange` <= `sumInRange`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
