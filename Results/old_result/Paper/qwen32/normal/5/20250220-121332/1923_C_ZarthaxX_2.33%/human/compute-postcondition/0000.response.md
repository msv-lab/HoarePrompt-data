The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `q`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `q` are integers within certain bounds, and these bounds remain valid after the code execution. The other variables (`t`, `c`, `l_i`, `r_i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); For each query, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
