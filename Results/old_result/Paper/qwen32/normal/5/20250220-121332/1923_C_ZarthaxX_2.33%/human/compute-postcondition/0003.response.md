The code snippet initializes a list named `sum` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, or `ones`. The only change is the creation of the `sum` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers, all initialized to 0.**
