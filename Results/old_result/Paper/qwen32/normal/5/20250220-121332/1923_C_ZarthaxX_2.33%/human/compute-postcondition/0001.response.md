The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. 

Given the initial state, `n` and `q` are integers read from input, and `c` is a list of `n` integers. The code snippet does not affect `t`, `n`, `q`, or `c` directly. It introduces a new variable `nums` which will hold the list of integers read from the input.

Since the specific input values are not provided, we can only state that `nums` will be a list of integers derived from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers read from input.**
