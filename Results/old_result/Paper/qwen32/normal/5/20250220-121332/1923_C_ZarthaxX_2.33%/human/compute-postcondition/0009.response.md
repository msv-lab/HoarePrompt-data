Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `q` are integers read from input such that 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 <= c_i <= 10^9); `nums` is a list of integers read from input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, and now `ones[i]` has been updated to `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` for the specific `i` being updated; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `sum[i]` has been updated to be `sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
