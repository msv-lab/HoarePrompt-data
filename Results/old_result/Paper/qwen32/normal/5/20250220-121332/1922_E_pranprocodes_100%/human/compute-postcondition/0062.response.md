The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, if `x` was even, it was initially `input integer / 2` and is now `(input integer / 2) - 1`. If `x` was odd, it was initially `input integer - 1` and is now `(input integer - 1) - 1` or `input integer - 2`. The states of `t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is `(input integer / 2) - 1` if `input integer` is even, otherwise `x` is `input integer - 2`; `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even, otherwise `max` is 100000000; `min` is -99999998 if `x` was odd, otherwise `min` is -99999999; `ans` is [100000000, -100000000] if `x` was even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -99999999]; `i` is incremented by 1.**
