The code snippet `min += 1` increments the value of the variable `min` by 1. The initial value of `min` depends on the parity of `x` and `x - 1`, but it is always one of the following: -100000000, -99999999, or -99999998. After incrementing, the new value of `min` will be -99999999, -99999998, or -99999997, respectively. 

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is any value other than 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, 99999999 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, 100000000 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or 100000000 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `min` is -99999999 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, -99999998 if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, -99999998 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or -99999997 if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000, -100000000] if `x` was even and `x - 1` was even, [100000000, 100000000, -99999999] if `x` was even and `x - 1` was odd, [100000000, -100000000, -99999999] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was even, or [-100000000, -99999999, -99999998] if `x` was odd and `x - 1` was odd, `i` is 1**.
