To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop. The loop condition is `x != 1`, meaning the loop will execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is 0
- `x` is an input integer
- `max` is 100000000
- `min` is -100000000
- `ans` is an empty list
- `i` is `t + 1` (which means `i` is 1)

The only variable in the loop head is `x`. Therefore, we need to adjust `x` so that the condition `x != 1` is satisfied. This means `x` should be any integer except 1.

Since `x` is an input integer, we need to specify that `x` must be different from 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `t + 1`**
