Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer divided by 2 (integer division), `max` is 99999998 if the original `x` is even, `max` is -100000000 if the original `x` is odd, `min` is -99999999 if the original `x` is odd, `min` is 99999999 if the original `x` is even, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999] if the original `x` is even or [-100000000, -99999999] if the original `x` is odd.**

In simple terms, the value of `x` is updated to be half of its original value (using integer division). The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged based on the original value of `x`.
