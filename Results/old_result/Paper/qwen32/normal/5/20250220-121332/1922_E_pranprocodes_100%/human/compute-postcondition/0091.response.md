The code snippet `min += 1` increments the value of `min` by 1. Given the initial state, `min` was `-100000000`, so after the operation, `min` becomes `-99999999`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is [-100000000], `i` is `t + 1`, and `x` is not divisible by 2.**
