Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Recap
- `t` is the number of iterations taken to reduce `x` to 1.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is the initial value of `max` decremented by the number of times an even `x` was encountered.
- `min` is the initial value of `min` incremented by the number of times an odd `x` was encountered.
- `ans` is a list of values reflecting the `max` and `min` values encountered during the loop iterations, but in reverse order.

### Analysis
Given that `x` is already 1, the number of iterations `t` taken to reduce `x` to 1 is 0 because `x` is already at 1. This implies that the loop that is supposed to reduce `x` to 1 did not execute at all.

Since the loop did not execute, the following can be inferred:
- The `max` value was never decremented because there were no even `x` values encountered.
- The `min` value was never incremented because there were no odd `x` values encountered.
- The `ans` list, which is supposed to store the `max` and `min` values encountered during the loop iterations in reverse order, remains empty because no iterations occurred.

### Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print(*ans)
```

Since `ans` is an empty list, printing `*ans` will result in no output.

### Final Output
Output: **(nothing)**
