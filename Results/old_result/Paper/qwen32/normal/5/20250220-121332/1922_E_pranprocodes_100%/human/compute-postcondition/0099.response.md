The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999 depending on whether `x` is even or odd. `ans` initially contains a single element, which is either 100000000 or -100000000. After appending `min`, `ans` will have two elements.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` must not be 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even and 100000000 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and -99999999 if `x` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, -100000000] if `x` was even and [-100000000, -99999999] if `x` was odd, `i` is 1**
