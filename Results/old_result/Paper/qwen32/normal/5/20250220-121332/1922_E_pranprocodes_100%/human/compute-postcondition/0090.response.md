The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. The value of `min` is -100000000. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [-100000000], `i` is `t + 1`, and `x` is not divisible by 2**.
