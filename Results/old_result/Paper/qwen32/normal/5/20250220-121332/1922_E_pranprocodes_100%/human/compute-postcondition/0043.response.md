The code snippet provided is:

```python
ans = []
```

This line of code reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list. Therefore, the value of `ans` changes from its previous state to an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations taken to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is the input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [], `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The variable `ans` is now an empty list. The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `i` remain as they were in the initial state.
