Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is 100000000 minus the number of times `x` was even.
- `min` is -100000000 plus the number of times `x` was odd.
- `ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values based on the parity of `x` in each iteration.
- `i` is 1.

### Analysis:
- Since `x` is already 1, no iterations are needed to reduce `x` to 1. Therefore, `t` is 0.
- Since `x` is 1, which is odd, the number of times `x` was even is 0, and the number of times `x` was odd is 1.
- `max` is calculated as `100000000 - 0` (number of times `x` was even) = `100000000`.
- `min` is calculated as `-100000000 + 1` (number of times `x` was odd) = `-99999999`.
- `ans` is a reversed list of `max` and `min` values. Since there is only one iteration and `x` was odd, `ans` will be `[-99999999, 100000000]`.

### Print Statement:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The elements of `ans` are `-99999999` and `100000000`. Therefore, the output will be these two numbers separated by a space.

Output: **-99999999 100000000**
