Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer that has been modified based on its parity (`x` is divided by 2 if it was even, or reduced by 1 if it was odd), `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even and 100000000 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and -99999999 if `x` was odd, `ans` is [100000000] if `x` was even and [-100000000] if `x` was odd, `i` is 1.**
