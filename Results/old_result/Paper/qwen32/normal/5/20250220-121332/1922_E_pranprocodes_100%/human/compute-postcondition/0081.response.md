The given code snippet assigns a specific value to the variable `min`. The value assigned is `-100000000`. This change only affects the variable `min`, and all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` contains the accumulated `max` and `min` values in reversed order, `i` is `t + 1`.**
