Output State: **`t` is 2, `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999997 if `x // 2` was even and `x // 2 - 1` was even, 99999998 if `x // 2` was even and `x // 2 - 1` was odd, 99999999 if `x // 2` was odd and `x // 2 - 1` was even, or 99999999 if `x // 2` was odd and `x // 2 - 1` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x // 2` was even and `x // 2 - 1` was even, -99999999 if `x // 2` was even and `x // 2 - 1` was odd, -99999999 if `x // 2` was odd and `x // 2 - 1` was even, or -99999998 if `x // 2` was odd and `x // 2 - 1` was odd, `ans` is [100000000, 100000000, `max`] if `x // 2` was even, [100000000, -100000000, `max`] if `x // 2` was odd and `x // 2 - 1` was even, or [-100000000, -99999999, `max`] if `x // 2` was odd and `x // 2 - 1` was odd, and `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` is now `x // 2`. The values of `t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i` remain as they were, except that `max`, `min`, and `ans` are now recalculated based on the new value of `x // 2`.
