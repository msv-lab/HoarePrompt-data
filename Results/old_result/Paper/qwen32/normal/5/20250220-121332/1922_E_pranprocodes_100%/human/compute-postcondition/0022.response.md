The value of `min` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, if `x` is odd, `min` was initially -99999999, so now `min` is -99999998. If `x` is even, `min` was initially not defined in the initial state, but since `min` is only relevant when `x` is odd, we focus on the odd case for the output state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is an input integer and must not be equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999998 if `x` is odd, `ans` is `[100000000, -99999999]` if `x` is odd, `ans` is `[100000000]` if `x` is even.**
