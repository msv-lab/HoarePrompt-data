To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `k` and `idx`.

The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must be `True`.

Given:
- `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4.
- `idx` is 2.

First, let's calculate `1 << idx` when `idx` is 2:
\[ 1 << 2 = 4 \]

The condition becomes:
\[ k \geq 4 \]

Since `k` is already stated to be at least 4 and less than 8, it satisfies the condition \( k \geq 4 \) for the current `idx` value of 2. Therefore, no adjustment to `k` is necessary to ensure the loop executes one more time.

However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the next possible value of `idx` that would still satisfy the condition. If `idx` were incremented, the condition would become:
\[ k \geq 1 << (idx + 1) \]

For `idx` to be 3:
\[ 1 << 3 = 8 \]
The condition would be:
\[ k \geq 8 \]

Since `k` is less than 8, the loop would not execute if `idx` were 3.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, we should not increment `idx`. The current state of `idx` (which is 2) is appropriate, and `k` remains within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`; `idx` is 2**
