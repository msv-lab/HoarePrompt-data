The code removes the element at the position `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 1, `1 << idx` evaluates to `2`. Therefore, the element at index `2` in the list `nums` will be removed. The element at index `2` in the provided list `nums` is `4`.

After the removal, the list `nums` will be `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 2, k + 1, k + 3]`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `idx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 2, k + 1, k + 3]`; `idx` is 1.**
