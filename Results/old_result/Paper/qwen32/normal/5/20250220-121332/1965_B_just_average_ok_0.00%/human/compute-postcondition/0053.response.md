Let's break down the problem step by step based on the given initial state.

1. **Variable Definitions and Values**:
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so its value is irrelevant for the output.
   - `n`: The first integer from the input. Its value is not used in the print statement, so it is irrelevant for the output.
   - `k`: The second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4. This means \(4 \leq k \leq 7\).
   - `nums`: A list defined as:
     \[
     [1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1, k + 5]
     \]
   - `idx`: Set to 2. This variable is not used in the print statement, so it is irrelevant for the output.

2. **List Construction**:
   - The list `nums` is explicitly constructed with the first 24 elements being powers of 2 and specific constants.
   - The last three elements are dependent on the value of `k`:
     - The 25th element is \(k - 4\).
     - The 26th element is \(k + 1\).
     - The 27th element is \(k + 5\).

3. **Determine the Values of the Last Three Elements**:
   - Since \(4 \leq k \leq 7\), we can determine the possible values for the last three elements:
     - If \(k = 4\):
       - 25th element: \(4 - 4 = 0\)
       - 26th element: \(4 + 1 = 5\)
       - 27th element: \(4 + 5 = 9\)
     - If \(k = 5\):
       - 25th element: \(5 - 4 = 1\)
       - 26th element: \(5 + 1 = 6\)
       - 27th element: \(5 + 5 = 10\)
     - If \(k = 6\):
       - 25th element: \(6 - 4 = 2\)
       - 26th element: \(6 + 1 = 7\)
       - 27th element: \(6 + 5 = 11\)
     - If \(k = 7\):
       - 25th element: \(7 - 4 = 3\)
       - 26th element: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
       - 27th element: \(7 + 5 = 12\)

4. **Formulate the Output**:
   - The print statement `print(*nums)` will print all elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces.
   - Given the possible values of `k`, the list `nums` will be one of the following:
     - For \(k = 4\): \([1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 0, 5, 9]\)
     - For \(k = 5\): \([1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 1, 6, 10]\)
     - For \(k = 6\): \([1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 2, 7, 11]\)
     - For \(k = 7\): \([1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 3, 8, 12]\)

5. **Final Output**:
   - Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4, k + 1, k + 5 (where 4 ≤ k ≤ 7)**
