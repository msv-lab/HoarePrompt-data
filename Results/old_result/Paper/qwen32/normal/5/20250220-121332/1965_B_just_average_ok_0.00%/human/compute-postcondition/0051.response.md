The code `nums.remove(1 << idx)` removes the element at the position `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given `idx` is 2, `1 << idx` evaluates to `1 << 2`, which is 4. Therefore, the element 4 is removed from the list `nums`.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4
- `nums` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - 4`, `k + 1`, `k + 5`]
- `idx` is 2

After the code execution:
- The element 4 is removed from `nums`.

Therefore, the updated list `nums` is [1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - 4`, `k + 1`, `k + 5`].

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is [1, 2, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k - 4`, `k + 1`, `k + 5`]; `idx` is 2.**
