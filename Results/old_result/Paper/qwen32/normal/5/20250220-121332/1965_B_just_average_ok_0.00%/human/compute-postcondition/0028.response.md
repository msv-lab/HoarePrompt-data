To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variable `idx` changes based on the value of `k`.

The loop condition is `while k >= 1 << idx:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `2^idx`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `idx` is 1, meaning `k` was at least 2 (since `2^1 = 2`).
- After 2 iterations: `idx` is 2, meaning `k` was at least 4 (since `2^2 = 4`).
- After 3 iterations: `idx` is 3, meaning `k` was at least 8 (since `2^3 = 8`).

However, the problem specifies that `k` is less than 8 but at least 4. This means the loop will stop after the second iteration because:
- At `idx = 2`, `k` is at least 4, so the loop condition `k >= 1 << 2` (which is `k >= 4`) is true.
- At `idx = 3`, `k` is less than 8, so the loop condition `k >= 1 << 3` (which is `k >= 8`) is false, and the loop terminates.

Therefore, the final value of `idx` will be 2.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`; `idx` is 2.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing, `idx` will be 2, and all other variables will remain as they were initially.
