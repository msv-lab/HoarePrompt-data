The code appends the value of `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 2 and `nums` is a predefined list, the value at `nums[2]` is 4. Therefore, the value being appended to `nums` is `k - 4`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input and must be less than 8 but at least 4; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4]`; `idx` is 2.**
