To determine the output, we need to understand the list `nums` and its length. According to the initial state, `nums` is defined as a list containing specific integer values followed by `k - 4`, `k + 1`, and `k + 5`.

First, let's break down the list `nums`:
- The list starts with the integers: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`
- After these 23 integers, the list includes three additional elements: `k - 4`, `k + 1`, and `k + 5`.

Since `k` is an integer such that \(4 \leq k < 8\), let's consider the possible values of `k`:
- If \(k = 4\), the three additional elements will be: \(4 - 4 = 0\), \(4 + 1 = 5\), and \(4 + 5 = 9\).
- If \(k = 5\), the three additional elements will be: \(5 - 4 = 1\), \(5 + 1 = 6\), and \(5 + 5 = 10\).
- If \(k = 6\), the three additional elements will be: \(6 - 4 = 2\), \(6 + 1 = 7\), and \(6 + 5 = 11\).
- If \(k = 7\), the three additional elements will be: \(7 - 4 = 3\), \(7 + 1 = 8\), and \(7 + 5 = 12\).

In all cases, the list `nums` will have 23 initial elements plus 3 additional elements, making a total of 26 elements.

Therefore, the length of `nums` is 26, regardless of the specific value of `k` within the given range.

Output: **26**
