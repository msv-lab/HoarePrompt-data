The code snippet creates a list `nums` containing 24 elements, where each element is a power of 2. Specifically, the `i`-th element of `nums` is `2^i` for `i` ranging from 0 to 23. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `nums` is now a list of powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^23`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `nums` is a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`.**
