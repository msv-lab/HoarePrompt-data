The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Therefore, `coord` now contains two tuples: the original one and the newly added one. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(p1, p2), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` and `y` are the two integers from the new input**.
