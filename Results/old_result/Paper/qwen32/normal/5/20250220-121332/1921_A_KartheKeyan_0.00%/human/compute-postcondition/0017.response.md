The code snippet provided calculates the value of `p2` based on the coordinates in the `coord` list. The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `p1` remain unchanged. The new value of `p2` is calculated as the squared difference of the x-coordinates plus the squared difference of the y-coordinates between the last two points in the `coord` list.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`**.
