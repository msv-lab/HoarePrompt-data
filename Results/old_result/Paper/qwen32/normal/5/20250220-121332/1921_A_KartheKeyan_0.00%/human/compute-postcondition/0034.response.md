The code snippet sorts the list `coord`. Given the initial state, `coord` contains four tuples representing coordinates. After sorting, `coord` will be reordered based on the default tuple comparison, which sorts primarily by the first element and secondarily by the second element if the first elements are equal.

Let's assume the initial values of `coord` are `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`. After sorting, the order of these tuples in `coord` will be determined by the values of `x1, x2, x3, x4` and `y1, y2, y3, y4`.

Since the exact values of `x1, x2, x3, x4, y1, y2, y3, y4` are not specified, we can't determine the exact new order of `coord`. However, we know that `coord` will be sorted in ascending order first by the x-coordinates and then by the y-coordinates if the x-coordinates are equal.

Other variables (`n`, `res`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `coord` is `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]` sorted in ascending order first by x-coordinates and then by y-coordinates, `res` is `0`, `i` is `3`, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**
