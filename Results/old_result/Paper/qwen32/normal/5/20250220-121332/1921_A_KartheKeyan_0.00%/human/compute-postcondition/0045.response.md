Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `coord` is a list containing a single tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` and `y` are the two integers from the new input, `p1` and `p2` remain as defined from the initial `coord` list.**

In natural language: The list `coord` now contains one tuple `(x, y)` which was appended to it. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial values.
