The code snippet `coord = []` sets the `coord` variable to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged as their values are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `coord` is `[]`, `res` is `sqrt((x2 - x1) * (x4 - x3))`, `i` is `3`, `x` is the first integer from the last input, `y` is the second integer from the last input, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**

In natural language: The `coord` list is now empty, while all other variables retain their initial values.
