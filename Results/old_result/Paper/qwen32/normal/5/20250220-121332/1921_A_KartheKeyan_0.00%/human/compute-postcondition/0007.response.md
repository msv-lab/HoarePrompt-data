The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. 

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input.

After the execution of `coord.append((x, y))`, the list `coord` is no longer empty but contains one element, the tuple `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is `[(x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input.**
