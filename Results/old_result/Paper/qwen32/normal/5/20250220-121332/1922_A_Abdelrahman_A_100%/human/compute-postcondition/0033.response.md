Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, and `slength` is an input integer. `no` is True, meaning that `c` is not equal to either `a` or `b`, and there is at least one character in `c` that is different from the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`. `counter` is not `n`.**
