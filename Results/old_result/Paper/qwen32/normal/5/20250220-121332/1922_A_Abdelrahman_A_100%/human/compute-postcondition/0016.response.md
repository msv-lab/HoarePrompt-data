Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `c` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters input by the user, `slength` is an input integer, `no` is False, `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, `counter` is 0, and `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`. The loop or if statement is broken.**

Explanation: The values of the variables do not change, but the loop or if statement is broken.
