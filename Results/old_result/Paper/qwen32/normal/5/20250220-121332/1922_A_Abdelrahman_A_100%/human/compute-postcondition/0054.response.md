The `print('YES')` statement in the given code snippet is straightforward. It does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is explicitly printing the string `'YES'`.
2. None of the variables (`t`, `tests`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `slength`, `i`, `counter`, `no`) are used in the `print` statement.
3. Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
