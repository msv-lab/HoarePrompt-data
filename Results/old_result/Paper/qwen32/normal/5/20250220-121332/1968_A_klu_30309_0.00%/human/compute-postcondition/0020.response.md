Output State: **The program returns `max_val` which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`, or the first divisor `y` found such that `2 * y >= x`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a value `max_val` that is either the largest divisor of `x` which is less than half of `x`, or the smallest divisor `y` of `x` such that `2 * y` is at least as large as `x`.
