To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head: `y`, `x`, and the range parameters `x - 1`, `1`, and `-1`.

The loop will execute if the range function produces at least one value. The `range(x - 1, 1, -1)` function will produce values starting from `x - 1` down to `2` (since the stop value is exclusive and the step is `-1`).

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
- `max_val` is 1.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `x - 1` should be greater than `1` (so that there is at least one value in the range).

Let's analyze the condition:
- If `x` is 2, then `x - 1` is 1, and the range becomes `range(1, 1, -1)`, which does not produce any values, so the loop does not execute.
- If `x` is greater than 2, then `x - 1` is greater than 1, and the loop will execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `x` must be greater than 2. The value of `y` is not something we can set before the loop starts, as it is initialized by the range function. The value of `max_val` does not affect the execution of the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is 1**
