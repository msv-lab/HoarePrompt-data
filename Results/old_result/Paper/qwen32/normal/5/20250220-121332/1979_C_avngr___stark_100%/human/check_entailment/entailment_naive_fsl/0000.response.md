Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not address the problem description at all. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, which is unrelated to the task of distributing bets in the game as described. The program does not contain any logic for distributing the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
