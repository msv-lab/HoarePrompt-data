Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The task is to distribute a certain number of coins across `n` possible outcomes such that, for each outcome, the amount received (which is the bet multiplied by the outcome's multiplier) is strictly greater than the total amount bet. In other words, if you bet `x_i` on the `i-th` outcome, and the multiplier for that outcome is `k_i`, then the total bet `sum(x_i)` must be less than `k_i * x_i` for every `i`.

### Approach:
The solution should find a set of bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the total bet is less than the amount received for each winning outcome. The key is to ensure that for each `i`, `sum(x_j) < k_i * x_i` for all `j`.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code includes two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
2. `func_2(numbers)`: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

However, the problem does not explicitly require the calculation of the LCM. The problem can be solved by assigning bets in a way that the condition `sum(x_j) < k_i * x_i` is satisfied for all `i`. A straightforward solution would be to assign bets such that each `x_i` is large enough to satisfy the condition.

### Possible Solution:
One possible solution strategy is to assign bets such that `x_i = LCM(k_1, k_2, ..., k_n) // k_i + 1` for each `i`. This ensures that the total bet is less than the amount received for each winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not directly address the problem of distributing the bets. It only calculates the LCM of the multipliers, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as described. The problem requires a specific distribution of bets, and the provided code does not provide such a distribution.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not solve the given problem as it does not provide a distribution of bets that satisfies the required conditions.
