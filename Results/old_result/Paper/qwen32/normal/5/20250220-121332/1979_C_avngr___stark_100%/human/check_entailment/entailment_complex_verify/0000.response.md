Let's analyze the problem and the provided code in detail.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to distribute a certain amount of coins on `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Mathematically, if `x_i` is the amount bet on the i-th outcome and `k_i` is the multiplier for that outcome, we need:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]

for all `i`. This can be simplified to:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]

Rearranging gives:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ x_i < \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{k_i - 1} \]

To satisfy this condition for all `i`, one approach is to set each `x_i` to a fraction of the least common multiple (LCM) of all `k_i` values. Specifically, if `m` is the LCM of all `k_i`, then setting `x_i` to `m // k_i` ensures that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m \]
\[ k_i \cdot x_i = k_i \cdot \frac{m}{k_i} = m \]

Since `m` is the LCM, `m // k_i` ensures that the sum of all `x_i` is less than `m`, and `k_i * x_i` is exactly `m`, which is strictly greater than the sum of all `x_i`.

### Code Analysis

The provided code calculates the LCM of the `k_i` values using the `func_2` function, which in turn uses `func_1` to compute the LCM of two numbers. The LCM is calculated as:

\[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]

The code then sets each `x_i` to `m // k_i` and checks if the sum of all `x_i` is less than `m`. If it is, the code outputs the `x_i` values; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.

### Annotations

The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
- `func_1` correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers.
- `func_2` correctly calculates the LCM of a list of numbers.
- The program calculates `x_i` as `m // k_i` and checks if the sum of `x_i` is less than `m`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is incorrect. The provided code does correctly solve the problem by calculating the LCM of the `k_i` values and distributing the bets accordingly. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **True**
