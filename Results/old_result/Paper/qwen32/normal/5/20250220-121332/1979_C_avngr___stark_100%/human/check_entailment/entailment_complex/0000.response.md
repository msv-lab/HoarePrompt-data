### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to solve the problem by distributing the bets in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Hereâ€™s how the program works:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.

2. **Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k`. This is done by iteratively applying the function `func_1`, which calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
     \]
   - The LCM is stored in the variable `m`.

3. **Distributing the Bets**:
   - For each outcome `i`, the program calculates the bet `c[i]` as `m // k[i]`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the total bet `sum(c)` will be strictly less than the return `k[i] * c[i] = m`.
   - The program then checks if the total bet `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If not, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.

4. **Output**:
   - If a valid distribution exists, the program prints the bets `c[i]` for each outcome.

### Analysis:

- **LCM Calculation**:
  - The LCM of the multipliers `k` ensures that each `k[i]` divides `m` without remainder. This is crucial for the subsequent steps.
  
- **Bet Distribution**:
  - By setting `c[i] = m // k[i]`, the program ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the return `k[i] * c[i]` equals `m`, which is greater than the total bet `sum(c)`.
  
- **Validation**:
  - The check `if sum(c) >= m` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If `sum(c)` is not less than `m`, it correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome based on the multipliers and ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
