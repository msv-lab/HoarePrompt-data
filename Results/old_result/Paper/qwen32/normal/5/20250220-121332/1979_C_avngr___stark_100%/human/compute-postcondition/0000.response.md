Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers, where each integer is a multiplier (2 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 20) for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning; `result` is the first element of `numbers`.**

In simple terms, the `result` variable is now assigned the value of the first element in the `numbers` list, while the `numbers` list remains unchanged.
