### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to determine a way to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the program attempts to achieve this:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to pairs of numbers.
   - The LCM of a list of numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the numbers in the list.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates the LCM `m` of the multipliers `k`.
   - It then computes a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is `m // k[i]`. This essentially divides the LCM by each multiplier.
   - The program checks if the sum of the elements in `c` is less than `m`. If the sum is not less than `m`, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - If the sum is less than `m`, it prints the elements of `c` as the distribution of bets.

### Analysis:

- The key idea here is to use the LCM `m` to ensure that the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome. By setting `c[i] = m // k[i]`, the program ensures that for each outcome `i`, the winnings `k[i] * c[i]` equal `m`, which is greater than the total bet `sum(c)` because `sum(c) < m`.

- This approach works because:
  - The LCM `m` is a common multiple of all `k[i]`, so `k[i] * c[i] = m` for each `i`.
  - Since `c[i] = m // k[i]`, the sum of `c` is `sum(m // k[i])`, which is always less than `m` because `m` is the smallest number that is a multiple of all `k[i]`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets for each test case. If a valid distribution exists, it outputs the bets; otherwise, it outputs `-1`.
