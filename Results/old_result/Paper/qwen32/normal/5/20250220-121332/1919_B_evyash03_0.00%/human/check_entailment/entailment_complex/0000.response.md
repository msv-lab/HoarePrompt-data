### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic to determine if it correctly computes the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement.

1. **Splitting the String:**
   - The program splits the string `expression` by `'-'` using `expression.split('-')`. This will create a list of substrings that do not contain any `'-'`.
   - It then calculates the sum of the lengths of these substrings, which is stored in `result_length`. However, this variable is not used anywhere in the function `func_1` and seems unnecessary for the calculation of the minimum penalty.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of times the cumulative balance of the string goes negative and adds one more if the final balance is positive.
   - The balance is calculated by iterating through each character of the string:
     - Increment the balance for each `'+'`.
     - Decrement the balance for each `'-'`.
     - If the balance goes negative, increment the `count` and reset the balance to 0.
   - After the loop, if the balance is positive, it adds one to the `count`.
   - The function returns this `count`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic implemented in `func_1` does not directly compute the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement. Instead, it counts how many times the balance goes negative and adds one if the final balance is positive.
   - The minimum penalty is calculated by optimally splitting the array `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The provided function does not attempt to split the array optimally and instead focuses on the balance going negative, which does not directly relate to minimizing the penalty.

### Conclusion:
The logic in the provided program does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
