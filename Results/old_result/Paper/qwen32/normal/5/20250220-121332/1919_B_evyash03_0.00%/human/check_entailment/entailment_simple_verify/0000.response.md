### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Understanding:
The task is to split the given string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum (where '+' contributes +1 and '-' contributes -1) multiplied by the length of the subarray.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program does not appear to correctly calculate the minimum penalty. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Splitting the String:**
   - `parts = expression.split('-')` splits the string at every '-' character. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the string to minimize the penalty.
   - `result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))` calculates the sum of lengths of parts after splitting at '-'. This is not relevant to the penalty calculation.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates through the string, updating a `balance` counter based on whether the current character is '+' or '-'.
   - When `balance` goes negative, it increments a `count` and resets `balance` to 0. This logic is intended to count the number of times the cumulative sum goes negative, which could be related to the number of splits needed.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`. This part adds 1 if the final balance is positive, suggesting that it accounts for any remaining positive balance as a final split.

#### Annotations:
The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
- `expression` is the input string.
- `length` is the length of the input string.
- `count` tracks the number of times the balance goes negative.
- `balance` is the final net balance after all resets.
- The function returns the number of times the balance went negative plus 1 if the final net balance is greater than 0.

#### Issues with the Program:
- The program does not consider the optimal way to split the string to minimize the penalty. It simply counts the number of times the cumulative sum goes negative and adds one if the final balance is positive.
- This logic does not align with the penalty calculation rules provided in the problem statement. The penalty for each subarray should be calculated as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the splits should be chosen to minimize the total penalty.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
+-++-
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
The optimal split is `([+,-],[+],[+],[-])`. The penalties are:
- `p([+,-]) = |1 - 1| * 2 = 0`
- `p([+]) = |1| * 1 = 1`
- `p([+]) = |1| * 1 = 1`
- `p([-]) = |-1| * 1 = 1`
Total penalty = `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

However, the provided code might not correctly handle this and could output a different (and incorrect) result.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The logic to split the array and calculate the penalty is flawed.

**Final: False**
