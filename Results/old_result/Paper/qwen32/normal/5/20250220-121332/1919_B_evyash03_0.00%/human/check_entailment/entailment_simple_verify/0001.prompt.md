You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

    #The program returns the number of times the balance went negative plus 1 if the final net balance is greater than 0, otherwise it returns just the number of times the balance went negative.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of each subarray `c` is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`. 

### Key Observations

1. **Subarrays with Zero Sum**: If a subarray has a sum of zero, its penalty is zero. Therefore, it's optimal to include such subarrays in the partition.
2. **Subarrays with Non-Zero Sum**: For subarrays with a non-zero sum, the penalty is the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length of the subarray. To minimize the total penalty, we should try to keep these subarrays as short as possible.

### Strategy

- Traverse the array while maintaining a balance counter that increases with `+` and decreases with `-`.
- Whenever the balance becomes negative, it means that the subarray from the last reset point to the current point has a non-zero sum. We should reset the balance and count this subarray.
- At the end of the traversal, if the balance is positive, it indicates that there is an unprocessed subarray with a positive sum.

### Provided Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    parts = expression.split('-')
    result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
    print(func_1(expression, result_length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
    return count + (balance > 0)
```

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Use of `result_length`**: The variable `result_length` is calculated but not used in the function `func_1`. This variable seems to be an attempt to count non-empty parts of the string when split by `-`, but it's not relevant to the optimal penalty calculation.
2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` only counts the number of subarrays with a negative balance and adds one if the final balance is positive. This does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. It only counts the number of subarrays with a negative balance and adds one if the final balance is positive, which does not align with the optimal strategy described above.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
