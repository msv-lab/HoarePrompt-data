Reasoning: 

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The logic in `func_1` is incorrect for the problem requirements. Here's why:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Current Implementation**: The function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance (sum of the subarray) goes negative and adds 1 if the final balance is positive. This approach does not consider the length of the subarrays or the absolute value of their sums, which are crucial for calculating the penalty.

3. **Correct Approach**: To find the optimal split, one should consider dynamic programming or a greedy approach to ensure the split minimizes the total penalty. The current implementation does not perform any calculations related to the length of the subarrays or their sums, which are necessary for the penalty calculation.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
