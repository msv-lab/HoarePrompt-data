Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `count` is 1, and `balance` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `expression`, `length`, and `balance` remain unchanged.
