Postcondition: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`. If `char` is '+', then if `balance` was less than 0, `count` is set to 1 and `balance` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` is incremented by 1. If `char` is '-', then if `balance` is less than 0, `count` is set to 1 and `balance` is set to 0; otherwise, `count` remains 0 and `balance` is decremented by 1. If `char` is neither '+' nor '-', `count` remains 0 and `balance` retains its original value. `char` is the next character in the `expression` string.**
