To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the `balance` and `count` variables evolve as the loop processes each character in the `expression` string.

### Initial State:
- `expression`: A string of '+' and '-' characters.
- `length`: The length of `expression`, where `1 <= length <= 5000`.
- `count`: 0 (initially).
- `balance`: 0 (initially).

### Loop Explanation:
1. **For each character in the `expression` string:**
   - If the character is '+', `balance` is incremented by 1.
   - If the character is '-', `balance` is decremented by 1.
   - If at any point `balance` becomes less than 0, `count` is incremented by 1, and `balance` is reset to 0.

### Final Output State:
- **`count`**: This variable keeps track of the number of times `balance` was less than 0 during the iteration of the loop. Each time `balance` drops below 0, it indicates a "debt" or imbalance that needs to be corrected by resetting `balance` to 0 and incrementing `count`.
- **`balance`**: By the end of the loop, `balance` will be the net positive or negative value of the expression after all adjustments (i.e., after resetting `balance` to 0 whenever it goes below 0).

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`count`**: Represents the number of times the cumulative sum (balance) of the expression went negative, requiring a reset.
- **`balance`**: Represents the final net balance of the expression after correcting all negative balances by resetting them to 0.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is:

Output State: **`count` is the number of times the balance went negative, and `balance` is the final net balance after all resets.**

To provide a concrete example, let's consider a sample `expression`:

**Example:**
- `expression = "++--+-"`
- Initial State: `count = 0`, `balance = 0`

**Processing:**
1. `char = '+'`: `balance = 1`
2. `char = '+'`: `balance = 2`
3. `char = '-'`: `balance = 1`
4. `char = '-'`: `balance = 0`
5. `char = '+'`: `balance = 1`
6. `char = '-'`: `balance = 0`

In this example, `balance` never went negative, so `count` remains 0 and `balance` ends up as 0.

Thus, the final output state would be:
Output State: **count is 0, balance is 0.**

However, if we had an expression like `"--++"`, the processing would be:
1. `char = '-'`: `balance = -1` → `count = 1`, `balance = 0`
2. `char = '-'`: `balance = -1` → `count = 2`, `balance = 0`
3. `char = '+'`: `balance = 1`
4. `char = '+'`: `balance = 2`

So, the final output state would be:
Output State: **count is 2, balance is 2.**

In general, the output state depends on the specific `expression` string provided. However, the format remains consistent.

Output State: **`count` is the number of times the balance went negative, and `balance` is the final net balance after all resets.**
