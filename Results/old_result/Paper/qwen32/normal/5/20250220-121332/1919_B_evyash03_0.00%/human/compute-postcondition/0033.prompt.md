You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer representing the length of the string such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: `count` is the number of times the balance went negative, and `balance` is the final net balance after all resets.
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the number of times the balance went negative plus 1 if the final net balance is greater than 0, otherwise it returns just the number of times the balance went negative.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `expression`, which is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and a parameter `length`, which is an integer representing the length of the string. The function calculates the number of times the balance goes negative as it processes each character in the string. If the final net balance is greater than 0, it adds 1 to the count of times the balance went negative before returning the result. Otherwise, it returns just the number of times the balance went negative.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of times the balance went negative plus 1 if the final net balance is greater than 0, otherwise it returns just the number of times the balance went negative.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
