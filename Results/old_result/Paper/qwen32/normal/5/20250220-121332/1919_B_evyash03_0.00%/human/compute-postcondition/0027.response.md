The code snippet `count += 1` increments the value of the variable `count` by 1. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, `char`, and `balance`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in the `expression` string. If `char` is '+', `balance` is increased by 1. If `char` is '-', `balance` is decreased by 1, `count` is increased by 1.**
