### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty of each subarray `c` is `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

#### Key Observations
1. **Subarrays with Zero Sum**: If a subarray has a sum of zero, its penalty is zero. Therefore, it's optimal to include such subarrays in the partition.
2. **Subarrays with Non-Zero Sum**: For subarrays with a non-zero sum, the penalty is the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length of the subarray. To minimize the total penalty, we should try to keep these subarrays as short as possible.

#### Strategy
- Traverse the array while maintaining a balance counter that increases with `+` and decreases with `-`.
- Whenever the balance becomes negative, it means that the subarray from the last reset point to the current point has a non-zero sum. We should reset the balance and count this subarray.
- At the end of the traversal, if the balance is positive, it indicates that there is an unprocessed subarray with a positive sum.

#### Provided Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    parts = expression.split('-')
    result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
    print(func_1(expression, result_length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
    return count + (balance > 0)
```

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Use of `result_length`**: The variable `result_length` is calculated but not used in the function `func_1`. This variable seems to be an attempt to count non-empty parts of the string when split by `-`, but it's not relevant to the optimal penalty calculation.
2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` only counts the number of subarrays with a negative balance and adds one if the final balance is positive. This does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement.

#### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary states:
- The function calculates the number of times a balance goes negative as it processes a string of "+" and "-" characters.
- If the final balance is positive, it adds one to the count of negative balances before returning the result.
- Otherwise, it returns the count of negative balances.

This summary is accurate in terms of what the function does, but it does not align with the optimal strategy for calculating the minimum penalty.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. The function `func_1` only counts the number of subarrays with a negative balance and adds one if the final balance is positive, which does not align with the optimal strategy described above.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
