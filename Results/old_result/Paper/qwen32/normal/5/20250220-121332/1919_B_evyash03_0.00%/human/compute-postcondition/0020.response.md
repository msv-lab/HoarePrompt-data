The code snippet provided sets the variable `balance` to 0. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, `char`, and `count`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" with at least one character, `length` is an integer representing the length of the string such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in the `expression` string, `count` is `count + 1`, `balance` is 0.**
