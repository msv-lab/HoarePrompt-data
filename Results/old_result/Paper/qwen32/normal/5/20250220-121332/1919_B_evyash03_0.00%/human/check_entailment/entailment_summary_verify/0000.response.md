Let's analyze the problem and the provided program in detail.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to split a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The goal is to find the optimal way to split the string to achieve the minimum total penalty.

### Program Analysis

The provided program consists of a main loop that processes each test case and a helper function `func_1` that calculates some value based on the input string and its length. Let's break it down:

1. **Main Loop:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Reads the length of the string `n`.
     - Reads the string `expression`.
     - Splits the string by '-' and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts.
     - Calls `func_1` with the original string and the calculated length.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Initializes `count` and `balance` to 0.
   - Iterates through each character in the string:
     - Increments `balance` for '+' and decrements for '-'.
     - If `balance` becomes negative, increments `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - After the loop, if `balance` is positive, increments `count` by 1.
   - Returns `count`.

### Function Summary

The function summary states that `func_1` calculates the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the final balance is positive. This does not directly align with the penalty calculation rules provided in the problem statement.

### Evaluation

Let's evaluate the correctness of the program based on the provided function summary and the problem description:

1. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty for a subarray is `|sum(subarray)| * length(subarray)`.
   - The provided function does not calculate this penalty directly. Instead, it counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the final balance is positive.

2. **Optimal Splitting:**
   - The program does not attempt to find the optimal way to split the string to minimize the total penalty. It simply counts the balance transitions, which does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

3. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the input `"+-++-"`:
     - The optimal split is `([+,-],[+],[+],[-])` with a total penalty of 3.
     - The provided function might not correctly handle this and could output a different result.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The current implementation does not properly consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: False**
