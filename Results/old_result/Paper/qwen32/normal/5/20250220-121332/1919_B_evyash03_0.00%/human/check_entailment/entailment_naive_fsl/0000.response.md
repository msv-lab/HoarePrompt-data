Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array as described in the problem statement. The current implementation does not properly consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:
1. The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the penalty for each split subarray.
2. The logic to split the array and calculate the penalty is flawed. The current approach simply counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds one if the balance is positive at the end, which does not align with the penalty calculation rules provided.

Let's consider a simple counterexample to demonstrate the issue:
Input:
```
1
5
+-++-
```
Expected Output:
```
2
```
Explanation:
The optimal split for this example is `([+,-],[+],[+],[-])`. The penalties are:
- `p([+,-]) = |1 - 1| * 2 = 0`
- `p([+]) = |1| * 1 = 1`
- `p([+]) = |1| * 1 = 1`
- `p([-]) = |-1| * 1 = 1`
Total penalty = `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

However, the provided code might not correctly handle this and could output a different (and incorrect) result.

Thus, the program is incorrect, and Correctness is **False**.
