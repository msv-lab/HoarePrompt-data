The code assigns the value of `d[i] + 1` to `d[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 0 and `d[0]` is 0, `d[1]` will be assigned the value `0 + 1`, which is 1. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `i` is 0; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the keys `0` and `1` assigned the values `0` and `1` respectively.**
