#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n, where each value represents the net number of opening parentheses up to that index, and `d[n]` is 0.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: the string `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` in the order specified by the sorted list `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string 'ans' which is a concatenation of characters from 's' in the order specified by the sorted list 'd'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` which is a rearrangement of characters from `s` based on the net number of opening parentheses up to each index, sorted by the net number and then by the index in descending order.
