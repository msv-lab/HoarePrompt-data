The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1` updates the dictionary `d` by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `i + 1` and the value is `d[i] - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `d[i]` (which is `d[0]`) is 0. Therefore, `d[i + 1]` (which is `d[1]`) will be assigned the value `d[0] - 1`, which is `0 - 1 = -1`.

The other variables `s`, `ans`, and the fact that `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence starting with ")" remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with the keys `0` and `1` assigned the values `0` and `-1` respectively, and the first character of `s` is ")"**.
