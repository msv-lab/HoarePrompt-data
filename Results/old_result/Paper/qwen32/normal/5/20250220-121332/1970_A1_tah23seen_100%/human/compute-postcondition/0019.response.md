The code `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Given that `d[n]` is initially 0, this key-value pair will be removed from `d`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n-1`, where each value represents the net number of opening parentheses up to that index.**
