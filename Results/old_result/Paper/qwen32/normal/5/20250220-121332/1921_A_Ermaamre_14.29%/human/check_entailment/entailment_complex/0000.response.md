### Reasoning:

The program is designed to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates. It then calculates the side length of the square by comparing the x and y coordinates of the corners. Specifically, it checks which pairs of x-coordinates are the same and then calculates the difference in the corresponding y-coordinates (or vice versa) to determine the side length. Finally, it squares the side length to get the area and prints it.

Let's review the logic in the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(x1, y1)`, `(x2, y2)`, `(x3, y3)`, and `(x4, y4)`.

2. **Calculating Side Length:**
   - The program checks which pairs of x-coordinates are the same to identify the vertical sides of the square.
   - It then calculates the difference in the y-coordinates of the corresponding points to get the side length.
   - Alternatively, it checks which pairs of y-coordinates are the same to identify the horizontal sides of the square and calculates the difference in the x-coordinates.

3. **Calculating Area:**
   - Once the side length is determined, the program squares it to get the area of the square and prints the result.

The logic in the program correctly identifies the side length of the square by comparing the coordinates and calculating the appropriate differences. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach is valid and should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the area of the square for each test case based on the given coordinates.
