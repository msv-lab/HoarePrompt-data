The code snippet assigns the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` to the variable `res`. The values of `t`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `i`, `a`, and `x4`, `y4` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `x1` and `y1` are integers read from the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers read from the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is greater than `i + 1`, `res` is `abs(y1 - y2)`, and `x4` and `y4` are integers read from the input.**
