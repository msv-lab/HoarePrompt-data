The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x1` and `y1`. The values of `t`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y4`, `i`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x1` and `y1` are integers read from the input, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y4` are integers, `x4` and `y4` represent the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is greater than `i + 1`, and `res` is set based on the conditions provided.**
