Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `a` must be greater than 0, `x1` and `y1` are integers representing the coordinates input by the user.**

Natural Language: The variables `t` and `a` retain their initial values. The coordinates of the corners of the square, except for `(x1, y1)`, remain unchanged. The variables `x1` and `y1` are now assigned the integer values provided by the user input, split into two separate integers.
