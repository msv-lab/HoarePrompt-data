The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x3` and `y3`. This means that the values of `x3` and `y3` will be updated based on the input.

The other variables (`t`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `i`, `a`, and `res`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `x1` and `y1` are integers read from the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers read from the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is greater than `i + 1`, and `res` is set based on the conditions provided.**
