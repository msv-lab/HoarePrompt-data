Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y3` are integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is greater than `i + 1`, and `x4` and `y4` are integers read from the input. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
