You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

    #State: The loop has executed `a` times, and for each iteration, it has read four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For each square, it calculates the side length `res` based on the coordinates and prints `res



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to determine the side length of the square by checking specific conditions on the x-coordinates of the points. However, this approach is not robust and can fail for certain configurations of the square's corners.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
0 0
1 1
1 0
0 1
```
In this case, the square has a side length of 1, and thus the area should be 1. However, the provided program will not correctly compute the side length because it only checks specific pairs of x-coordinates and assumes the other coordinates will match accordingly. For this input, the program will not correctly identify the side length and will likely produce an incorrect result.

The program should instead compute the differences between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points to determine the side length of the square. A more robust solution would involve sorting the points or using a different approach to ensure the correct side length is calculated regardless of the order of the points.
