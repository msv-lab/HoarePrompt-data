The code snippet `x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())` will read two integers from the input, split them, and assign them to `x1` and `y1` respectively. The other variables `t`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x1` and `y1` are integers read from the input, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `res` is determined based on the conditions provided, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `a` must be greater than the current value of `i`**.
