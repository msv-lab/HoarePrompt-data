Output State: **The loop has executed `a` times, and for each iteration, it has read four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For each square, it calculates the side length `res` based on the coordinates and prints `res ** 2`, which is the area of the square. The value of `t` (the number of test cases) and the coordinates of the squares remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing all iterations.**

In simpler terms: After the loop has run `a` times, it has calculated and printed the area of `a` squares based on the input coordinates. The number of test cases `t` and the input coordinates themselves remain the same.
