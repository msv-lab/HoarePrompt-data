To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given conditions and the calculation of `res`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
   - The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, implying that two pairs of x-coordinates and two pairs of y-coordinates will be the same.

2. **Conditions for `res`**:
   - If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is equal to the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`.
   - Otherwise, if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is set to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met and `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is equal to the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.

3. **Calculation of `res`**:
   - Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, one of the above conditions will always be true.
   - `res` will be the length of one side of the square, which is the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the points that share the same x-coordinate or the absolute difference between the x-coordinates of the points that share the same y-coordinate.

4. **Calculation of `res ** 2`**:
   - `res ** 2` will be the area of the square since `res` is the length of one side of the square.

5. **Output**:
   - The code will print the square of `res`, which is the area of the square.

Thus, the output will be the area of the square formed by the given coordinates.

Output: **res ** 2 (where res ** 2 is the area of the square formed by the given coordinates)**
