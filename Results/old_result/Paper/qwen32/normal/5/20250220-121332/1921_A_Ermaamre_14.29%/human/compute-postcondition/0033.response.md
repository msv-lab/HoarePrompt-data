The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x3` and `y3`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `x3` and `y3` changes based on the input, while the values of `t`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x4`, `y4`, `res`, `i`, and `a` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x1` and `y1` are integers read from the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers read from the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers read from the input, `x4`, `y4` are integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, `res` is determined based on the conditions provided, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `a` must be greater than the current value of `i`.**
