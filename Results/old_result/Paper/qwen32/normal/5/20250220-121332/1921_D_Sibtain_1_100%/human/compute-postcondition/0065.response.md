The code snippet `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given that `j` is initially either 1 or 2, after the increment, `j` will be either 2 or 3. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `len(a)`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 3.**
