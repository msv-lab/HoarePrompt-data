Let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, and the length of `a` is 1.
- `c` is a list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order.
- If the first (and only) element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then all elements in `a` and `c` are the same. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied and `a` is sorted.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a` and `c`:**
   - `a` is a list with only one element, so `a[0]` is the single element in `a`.
   - `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, so `max(c)` is `c[0]` (the first element) and `min(c)` is `c[-1]` (the last element).

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `a[0]` (the only element in `a`) is equal to `c[0]` (the first element in `c`), then all elements in `a` and `c` are the same.
   - If the condition is not satisfied, `a` is sorted. Since `a` has only one element, it is trivially sorted.

3. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c)))`.
   - Since `max(c)` is `c[0]` and `min(c)` is `c[-1]`, the expression becomes `max(abs(a[0] - c[0]), abs(a[0] - c[-1]))`.

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `a[0] == c[0]`**
     - If `a[0]` is equal to `c[0]`, then `abs(a[0] - c[0])` is 0.
     - Since `c` is sorted in descending order, `c[-1]` is the smallest element in `c`.
     - The expression simplifies to `max(0, abs(a[0] - c[-1]))`.
     - The output will be `abs(a[0] - c[-1])` because the maximum of 0 and any non-negative number is that number.
   
   - **Case 2: `a[0] != c[0]`**
     - If `a[0]` is not equal to `c[0]`, then `abs(a[0] - c[0])` is a positive number.
     - The expression becomes `max(abs(a[0] - c[0]), abs(a[0] - c[-1]))`.
     - The output will be the larger of the two absolute differences.

### Final Output:
Based on the above analysis, the output will be the maximum of the absolute differences between `a[0]` and the first and last elements of `c`.

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - c[0]), abs(a[0] - c[-1])) (where a[0] is the single element in list a, c[0] is the first element in the sorted list c in descending order, and c[-1] is the last element in list c)**
