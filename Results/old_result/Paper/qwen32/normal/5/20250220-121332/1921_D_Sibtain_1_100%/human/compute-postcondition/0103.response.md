The code snippet provided is `j += 1`, which increments the value of `j` by 1. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `k + 1`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `j` is `j + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` and `m` remain the integers read from the input, `a` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input, `c` remains the sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order, `ans` remains the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `k` remains `k + 1`, `t1` remains the absolute difference between the `i`-th elements of `a` and `c`, `t2` remains the absolute difference between the elements at positions `len(a) - j` and `len(c) - j` in `a` and `c` respectively, and `j` is incremented by 1.
