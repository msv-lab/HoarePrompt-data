Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order, `ans` is 0, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, and `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, changing from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
