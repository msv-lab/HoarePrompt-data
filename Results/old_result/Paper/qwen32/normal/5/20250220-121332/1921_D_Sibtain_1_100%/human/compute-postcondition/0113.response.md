The code snippet `ans += max(t1, t2)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the input in descending order, `ans` is the previous `ans` plus `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `k + 1`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. If `t2 > t1`, then `j` is `j + 1`; otherwise, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` has been updated to include the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
