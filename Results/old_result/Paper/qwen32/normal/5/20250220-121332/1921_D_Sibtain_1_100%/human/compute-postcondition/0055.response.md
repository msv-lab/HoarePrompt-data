The code calculates the absolute difference between the `j`-th last element of the sorted list `a` and the `j`-th last element of the sorted list `c` in descending order, and assigns this value to `t2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Given `j` is 1, `t2` will be the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is 0, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`.**
