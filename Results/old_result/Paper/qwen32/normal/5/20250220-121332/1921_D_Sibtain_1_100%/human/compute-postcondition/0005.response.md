Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
2. `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
3. `a` is a list of integers read from the input where all elements are the same.
4. `c` is a list of integers read from the input where all elements are the same.
5. The first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(0)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(0)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `c`. The statement simply prints the integer `0`.

### Output:
Since the `print` statement is directly outputting the integer `0`, the result is clear and does not require any further computation or description based on the provided variables.

Output: **0**
