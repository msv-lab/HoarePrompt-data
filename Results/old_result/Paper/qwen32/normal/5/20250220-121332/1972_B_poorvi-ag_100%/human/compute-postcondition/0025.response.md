The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used to iterate over the elements in the `results` list. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `i` and the `results` list.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element of the `results` list.
- `results` is a list containing at least 1 string, each either 'yes' or 'no'.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in the `results` list. However, since `i` was the last element at the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have terminated if there were no more elements. Therefore, to make the loop execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` should be the next element in the `results` list, which means `results` must have at least two elements.
- Since `i` was the last element in the previous iteration, it must have been the first element of the `results` list. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` should be the second element of the `results` list.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least 2 strings, each either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is the second element of the `results` list**.
