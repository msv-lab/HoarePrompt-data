Given the initial state:
- `results` is a list containing at least 3 strings, each either 'yes' or 'no'.
- `i` is the third element of the `results` list.

We need to determine what `print(i)` will output.

Since `i` is specifically defined as the third element of the `results` list, and the list contains at least 3 elements, `i` can be either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the actual values in the list. However, without the specific values of the `results` list, we can only say that `i` will be one of the strings 'yes' or 'no'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be either 'yes' or 'no'.

Output: **i (where i is the third element of the results list, which is either 'yes' or 'no')**
