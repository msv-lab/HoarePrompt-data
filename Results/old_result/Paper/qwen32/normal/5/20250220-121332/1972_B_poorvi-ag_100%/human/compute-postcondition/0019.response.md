The code appends the string 'yes' to the list `results`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The list `results` now includes an additional 'yes' element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `results` is a list containing either the string 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, and now includes an additional 'yes'; `n` is the integer input from the user; `arr` is the new string input from the user.**
