You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is `t-1`; `results` is a list containing `t` strings, each either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each corresponding `arr` is odd or even; `n` is the integer input from the user for the last test case; `arr` is the string input from the user for the last test case.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: the loop has printed all elements of the `results` list, and `i` is the last element of the `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. The function returns the number of times the sequence of coins changes from "U" to "D" or from "D" to "U" for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
