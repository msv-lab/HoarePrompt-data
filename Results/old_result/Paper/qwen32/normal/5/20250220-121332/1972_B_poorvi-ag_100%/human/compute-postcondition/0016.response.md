The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. Therefore, we need to adjust only these variables for the loop to execute one more time. Given that the loop iterates `t` times, and `i` is the loop variable, at the start of each iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `results` is a list containing either the string 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, and now includes an additional 'yes' if the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, or an additional 'no' if the count of 'U' in `arr` is even; `n` is the integer input from the user; `arr` is the string input from the user.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. There is no need to adjust `t` because it represents the total number of iterations and does not change during the loop execution.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `results` is a list containing either the string 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, and now includes an additional 'yes' if the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, or an additional 'no' if the count of 'U' in `arr` is even; `n` is the integer input from the user; `arr` is the string input from the user.**
