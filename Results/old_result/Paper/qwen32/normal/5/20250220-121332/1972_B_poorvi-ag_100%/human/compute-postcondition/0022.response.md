Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `i` is `t-1`; `results` is a list containing `t` strings, each either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each corresponding `arr` is odd or even; `n` is the integer input from the user for the last test case; `arr` is the string input from the user for the last test case.**

In natural language, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` still represents the total number of test cases. The variable `i` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `t` iterations. The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each a 'yes' or 'no', corresponding to whether the count of 'U' in the string `arr` for each test case was odd or even. The variables `n` and `arr` will hold the values from the last test case processed by the loop.
