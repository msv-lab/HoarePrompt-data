The code snippet sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `ntest`, and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now ordered from the smallest to the largest integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is an integer greater than 0; `n` is the integer input by the user; `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.**
