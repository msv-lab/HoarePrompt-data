You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `ntest` is an integer greater than 0; all `n` values are integers input by the user such that `n` ≥ 2 for each test case; all `a` lists are sorted lists of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9 for each test case; for each test case, `kq` is the sum of differences `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`; `itest` has completed all iterations from 0 to `ntest - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, until it has considered half of the list. It then prints this sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to maximize the sum of differences by pairing the largest and smallest elements, but it does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize the beauty as defined in the problem.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. To maximize this, the array should be sorted in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. However, the current implementation only considers a specific pairing strategy that does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

Let's consider a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
1 3 2 4
```

Expected Output:
```
6
```

Explanation of Expected Output:
To maximize the beauty, we can sort the array in increasing order: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The beauty is calculated as:
- (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

However, sorting in decreasing order `[4, 3, 2, 1]` gives:
- (3 - 4) + (2 - 3) + (1 - 2) = -1 -1 -1 = -3 (not valid since we need positive differences)

But sorting in decreasing order `[4, 3, 2, 1]` and taking absolute differences gives:
- (3 - 4) + (2 - 3) + (1 - 2) = -1 -1 -1 = -3 (not valid since we need positive differences)

Instead, the correct approach is to sort the array in increasing order and calculate the beauty as:
- (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

However, the given program would calculate:
- (4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 3 + 1 = 4 (incorrect)

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

So, the Correctness is **False**.
