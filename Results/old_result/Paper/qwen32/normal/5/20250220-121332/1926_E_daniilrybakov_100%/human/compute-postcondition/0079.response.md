Output State: **`n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `t` is `t - 1`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Natural language explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`. All other variables (`k`, `s`, `m`, `t`, and `x`) remain unchanged. The expression for `s` and `x` still holds based on the new value of `n`.
