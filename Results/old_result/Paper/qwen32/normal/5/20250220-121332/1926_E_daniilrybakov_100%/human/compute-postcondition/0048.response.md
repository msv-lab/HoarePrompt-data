The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is now `n // 2`, which means `n` has been halved.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is halved in each iteration, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 before the next iteration starts.

Therefore, to guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 before it gets halved in the next iteration (since `2 // 2 = 1`, which is still greater than 0).

State: **`t` is an integer input value such that \(0 \leq t-1 \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\); `n` must be at least 2; `k` is the second integer read from the input such that \(1 \leq k \leq \text{original } n\); `s` is `original n + 1`; `m` is 4; `x` is `(original n + 1) // 2`.**
