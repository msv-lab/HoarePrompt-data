Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `t` is `t - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `m` is set to 1, while the other variables (`n`, `k`, `s`, and `t`) retain their initial values or expressions. The value of `t` is still described as `t - 1` since the code does not modify `t`.
