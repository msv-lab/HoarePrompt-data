To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to look at the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

```
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as all three conditions are true:
1. `list[i] > 1`
2. `list[i - 1] > 0`
3. `list[i + 1] > 0`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `list` is a list of integers where `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 0`, `list[2] = -4`
- `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`

Let's analyze the conditions with the current state:
- `list[i] > 1`: This condition depends on the current value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `list[0] = 1`, which does not satisfy the condition `list[i] > 1`.
- `list[i - 1] > 0`: This condition depends on `i - 1`. If `i` is 1, `list[0] = 1`, which does not satisfy the condition `list[i - 1] > 0`.
- `list[i + 1] > 0`: This condition depends on `i + 1`. If `i` is 1, `list[2] = -4`, which does not satisfy the condition `list[i + 1] > 0`.

Since `i` is not specified in the given state, we can't directly determine its value. However, we know that `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 0`, and `list[2] = -4` do not satisfy any of the conditions for the loop to continue.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the values of `list[i]`, `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` to satisfy all three conditions. Let's assume `i` is 1 for the sake of this example (since it's a common middle index for a list of three elements).

To satisfy the conditions:
1. `list[1] > 1`: Set `list[1]` to a value greater than 1, e.g., `list[1] = 2`.
2. `list[0] > 0`: Set `list[0]` to a value greater than 0, e.g., `list[0] = 1` (it already satisfies this condition).
3. `list[2] > 0`: Set `list[2]` to a value greater than 0, e.g., `list[2] = 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`list` is a list of integers where `list[0] = 1`, `list[1] = 2`, `list[2] = 1`; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`**

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time with the given conditions.
