list is a 2D list where each sublist contains n integers (0 \le a_j \le 10^9) representing the elements of the array for each test case, and n is an integer such that 3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5. The first element of the input is an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
