The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` effectively multiplies `list[i - 1]` by 0, setting it to 0. Therefore, the value of `list[i - 1]` will be 0 after the execution of the code. The other elements of the list and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `list[0] = 1` and `list[1]` and `list[2]` are dependent on the value of `i`. If `i` is 1, `list[0]` will be set to 0. If `i` is 2, `list[1]` will be set to 0. If `i` is 3, `list[2]` will be set to 0.

Output State: **`list` is a list of integers where `list[0]` is 0 if `i` is 1, `list[1]` is 0 if `i` is 2, `list[2]` is 0 if `i` is 3, `list[1]` is either 2 or 0 if `i` is not 2, `list[2]` is either 0 or -4 if `i` is not 3; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.**
