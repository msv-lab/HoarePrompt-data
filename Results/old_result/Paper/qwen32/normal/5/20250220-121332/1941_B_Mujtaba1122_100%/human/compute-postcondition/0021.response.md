To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` given the initial state of the list.

Given:
- `list[2]` is 2
- `list[1]` is 1
- `list[3]` is 0
- The remaining elements are either 0 or 1, with no element greater than 1.

Let's assume `i` is 2 for the sake of this example, as the problem doesn't specify the value of `i`. If `i` were any other value, the effect would be on that index and its predecessor.

When `i` is 2:
- `list[2] -= 2 * list[1]`
- `list[2] -= 2 * 1`
- `list[2] -= 2`
- `list[2] = 2 - 2`
- `list[2] = 0`

Thus, the value at `list[2]` changes from 2 to 0. No other elements in the list are affected by this operation.

Output State: **The list is a list of integers where `list[2]` is 0, `list[1]` is 1, and `list[3]` is 0, and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, with no element greater than 1.**
