Reasoning:
The provided Python program is intended to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index i (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and modifying the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1 according to the rules provided.

Let's analyze the functions:

1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zeros. If any element is not zero, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. This function is correctly implemented to check if the array is all zeros.

2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to transform the array into a form where all elements can be made zero using the specified operation. However, there are issues with the implementation:
   - The while loop condition is incorrect. It should be `while list[i] > 0 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` instead of `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0`. The current condition will not allow the operation to be applied when `list[i]` is 1, which is necessary to reduce the array to all zeros.
   - The operations inside the while loop are incorrect. The current implementation subtracts `list[i - 1]` times the respective values from `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]`. This does not match the operation described in the problem statement, which subtracts fixed values (1, 2, and 1) from `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]`, respectively.
   - The print statement inside the loop prints 'no' and returns if `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the while loop. This is incorrect because the loop should continue to process the array, and 'no' should only be printed if it is determined that it is impossible to make all elements zero.
   - The final check `if func_1(list, n)` is correct in that it checks if the array is all zeros after processing, but the preceding logic is flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.

Correctness: **False**
