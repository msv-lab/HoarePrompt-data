The code snippet modifies the value of `list[i]` by subtracting twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, so `list[i]` refers to `list[4]`, and `list[i - 1]` refers to `list[3]`. 

From the initial state, `list[3]` is 1 and `list[4]` is greater than 1. Therefore, `list[4]` will be updated to `list[4] - 2 * list[3]`, which simplifies to `list[4] - 2`. Since `list[4]` is greater than 1, after the operation, `list[4]` will still be greater than 1 but will be 2 less than its original value.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **The list is a list of integers where `list[2]` is 0, `list[1]` is 1, `list[3]` is 1, `list[4]` is greater than 1 and 2 less than its original value, `list[5]` is greater than 0 and `list[5]` is decremented by 1, and the remaining elements are either 0 or 1, with no element greater than 1, and `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 5.**
