To determine the necessary state adjustments for the provided for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This loop will execute if the range `(1, n - 1)` is non-empty, meaning `n - 1` must be greater than `1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `2`.

Given the initial state:
- `list` is a list of integers, and `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `len(list) == n`.

Since `n` is already constrained to be between `3` and `2 * 10^5`, the condition for the loop to execute is already satisfied (`n > 2`).

The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is the loop variable and will be initialized to `1` at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute based on the given constraints.

State: **`list` is a list of integers, and `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `len(list) == n`**
