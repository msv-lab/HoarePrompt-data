The code snippet `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` reduces the value of `list[i - 1]` to zero because `1 * list[i - 1]` is the same as `list[i - 1]`.

Given the initial state, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, after executing this line, `list[i - 1]` will be 0. This change will affect the conditions involving `list[i - 1]` in the initial state.

The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the changed value of `list[i - 1]`. Specifically, the conditions for `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` are still valid because the change in `list[i - 1]` does not directly impact their calculations as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`list[i]` is `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`; `list[i]` must be greater than 1; `list[i - 1]` is 0; `list[i + 1]` is `list[i + 1] - list[i - 1]` and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.**
