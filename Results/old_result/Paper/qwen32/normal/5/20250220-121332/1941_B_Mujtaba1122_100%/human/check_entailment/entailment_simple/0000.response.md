### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and applying the given operation whenever possible. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**:
   - The operation described in the problem states that if we choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)), we should perform:
     - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
     - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
     - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)
   - In the code, the operation is incorrectly implemented as:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - This means the operation is not applied correctly, as it subtracts multiple times the value of `list[i - 1]` instead of just 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - After attempting to apply the operation, the code checks if `list[i - 1] != 0` and immediately prints "no" if true. This is incorrect because the operation might not have been applied enough times yet.
   - The code should continue to attempt the operation until it can no longer be applied (i.e., until `list[i] <= 1` or `list[i - 1] == 0` or `list[i + 1] == 0`).

3. **Final Check**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero. However, the logic to reduce the array to zeros is flawed due to the incorrect operation implementation and the premature condition check.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
