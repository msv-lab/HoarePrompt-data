### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and annotations to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Recap:
Given an array `a` of `n` integers, we can perform an operation that selects an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n - 1`) and modifies the array as follows:
- `a[i - 1] = a[i - 1] - 1`
- `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
- `a[i + 1] = a[i + 1] - 1`

The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using this operation any number of times.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(list, n)`: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`. This function seems correct.
2. `func_2(list, n)`: This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros by applying the described operation. However, there are significant issues with the logic and implementation.

#### Issues in `func_2`:
1. **Incorrect Operation Logic**: The operation in the loop is incorrect. The operation should decrement `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by `1`, `2`, and `1` respectively, but the program incorrectly multiplies these decrements by `list[i - 1]`. This means the operation is not applied as intended.
2. **Premature Termination**: The program prints 'no' and returns as soon as it finds `list[i - 1]` is not zero, which is incorrect. It should continue to try other operations.
3. **Final Check**: The final check using `func_1` is correct, but the incorrect operation logic means the array may not be properly reduced to zeros.

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points but do not address the core logic issues in `func_2`. The annotations state that the program should reduce the array to a sequence of `1`s followed by `0`s, which is not the intended behavior.

### Correctness:
Given the issues described, the program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to improper operation logic and premature termination.

Final: **False**
