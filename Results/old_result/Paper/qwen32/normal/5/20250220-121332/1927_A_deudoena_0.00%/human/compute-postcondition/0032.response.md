To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' in the string `inpstr`.
- `ind2` is the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' when searching from the end of the string `inpstr`.
- `outind` is set to 0 (though it is not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`ind1`**: This is the index of the first 'B' from the start of the string `inpstr`. If there are multiple 'B's, `ind1` will be the index of the leftmost 'B'.
2. **`ind2`**: This is the index of the first 'B' from the end of the string `inpstr`. If there are multiple 'B's, `ind2` will be the index of the rightmost 'B'.
3. **`len(inpstr)`**: This is the total length of the string `inpstr`.

### Calculation:
The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the number of characters between the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end, excluding these two 'B's.

### Example:
Let's consider an example string `inpstr = "AXBBYBCZB"`:
- `ind1` would be 2 (the index of the first 'B' from the start).
- `ind2` would be 8 (the index of the first 'B' from the end).

The calculation would be:
\[ \text{Output} = \text{len(inpstr)} - \text{ind2} - \text{ind1} = 9 - 8 - 2 = -1 \]

However, the general formula will be based on the positions of the two 'B's.

### General Output:
The value printed will be the number of characters between the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end, excluding these two 'B's. If there is only one 'B', `ind1` and `ind2` will be the same, and the result will be `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **number of characters between the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end, excluding these two 'B's (where ind1 is the index of the first 'B' from the start and ind2 is the index of the first 'B' from the end)**
