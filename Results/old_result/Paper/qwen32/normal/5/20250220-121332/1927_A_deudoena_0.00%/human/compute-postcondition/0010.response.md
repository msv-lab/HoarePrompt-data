Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`, `inpstr` is a non-empty string, `outind` is 0. If `j` is 'B', then `ind1` is 1 and `ind2` is 0. Otherwise, `ind1` is 1 and `ind2` retains its initial value of 0. `i` is 1, `j` is `inpstr[1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind1` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 1. Other variables retain their initial values.
