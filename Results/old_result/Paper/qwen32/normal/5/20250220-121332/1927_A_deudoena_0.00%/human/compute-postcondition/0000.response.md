The code snippet `inpstr = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `inpstr`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`. The variable `inpstr` is introduced and assigned the value of the input, but the values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B' present in `s`; `inpstr` is the input string.**
