test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the length of the strip, and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the given strip is black in each test case.
