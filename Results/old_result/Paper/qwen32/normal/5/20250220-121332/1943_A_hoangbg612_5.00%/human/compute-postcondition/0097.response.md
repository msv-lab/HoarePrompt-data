The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only terminates the loop or the control flow structure it is placed in. Therefore, the values of `M`, `S`, `N`, `i`, and `cur` remain unchanged. The only impact is the termination of the loop or the control flow structure.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `cur` is equal to the incremented value of `i`.**
