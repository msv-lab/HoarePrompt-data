The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the index `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The values of `N`, `S`, `cur`, and `num` remain unchanged unless otherwise specified by the code. Since the code does not modify `N`, `S`, `cur`, or `num`, and it introduces a new dictionary `M` with an entry at the index `cur` with the value `1`, the output state includes this new information.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is equal to `num`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after the previous `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is updated to `num - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. `M[cur]` is 1.**
