The code snippet provided assigns the value of `num` to the variable `cur`. The other variables (`M`, `S`, `N`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`M` is an empty dictionary; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `cur` is equal to `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**

Explanation in Natural Language: The variable `cur` is now set to the value of `num`. The conditions related to `cur` being greater than `cur + 1` or remaining -1 are not affected by this assignment and will be evaluated based on the new value of `cur`. The other variables (`M`, `S`, `N`) retain their initial values.
