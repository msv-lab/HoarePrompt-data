Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`; `S` remains unchanged; `N` remains unchanged. If the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is the last element in `N` plus 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last element in `N`.**
