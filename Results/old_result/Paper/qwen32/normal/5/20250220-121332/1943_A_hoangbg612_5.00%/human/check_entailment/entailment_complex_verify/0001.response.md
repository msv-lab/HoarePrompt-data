### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and its annotations to verify its correctness based on the problem description and the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Alice maximizes the MEX of `c`, while Bob minimizes it.
2. **Game Rules**: Players take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` until `a` is empty. Alice starts first.
3. **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

#### Optimal Strategy:
- **Alice**: Picks the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
- **Bob**: Picks the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `N` is sorted to facilitate picking the smallest available number.

3. **Tracking Counts**:
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in `N`.
   - The variable `cur` is used to keep track of the current maximum MEX value.

4. **Processing Elements**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the `M` dictionary and `cur` variable accordingly.
   - If a number is greater than `cur + 1`, it means a gap is found, and `cur` is updated to `cur + 1` and the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, the count of the number in `M` is updated.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all elements, the program checks if the total count of elements in `M` equals `S`.
   - If yes, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, cur)` to find the first index where the count in `M` is less than or equal to the index, and updates `cur` to that index.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `cur` as the MEX of the array `c`.

#### Verification:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the array helps in easily finding the smallest numbers first, which aligns with the optimal strategies.
- **Tracking Counts**: The dictionary `M` keeps track of the counts of each number, which is crucial for determining the MEX.
- **Finding Gaps**: The condition `if num > cur + 1` correctly identifies gaps in the sequence, and `cur` is updated accordingly.
- **Final Check**: The final check ensures that if all numbers from `0` to `cur - 1` are present, `cur` is incremented to `cur + 1`. The loop to find the first index where the count is less than or equal to the index ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c` is found.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, and they align with the expected behavior based on the problem and the optimal strategies.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX under the optimal play conditions for both Alice and Bob. It handles the edge cases and correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

### Final Evaluation:
**Final: True**
