The code snippet `cur = num` updates the value of `cur` to the value of `num`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `N` remains a sorted list of integers, `S` remains an input integer, and `num` remains the next integer in the list `N`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `num` is the next integer in the list `N`.**
