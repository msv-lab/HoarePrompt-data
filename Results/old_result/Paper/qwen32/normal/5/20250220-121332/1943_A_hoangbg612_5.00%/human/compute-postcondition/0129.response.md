Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is either -1, equal to the previous `num`, or updated to `num - 1` if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `num` is the next integer in the list `N` after the previous `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the loop or if statement is broken and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
