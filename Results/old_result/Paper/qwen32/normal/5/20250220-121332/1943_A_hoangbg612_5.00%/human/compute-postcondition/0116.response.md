Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is either -1 or 0, and `num` is an integer greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`.**
