Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `cur` is equal to `i` incremented by 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language explanation: The values of `i` and `cur` remain as they were described in the initial state. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
