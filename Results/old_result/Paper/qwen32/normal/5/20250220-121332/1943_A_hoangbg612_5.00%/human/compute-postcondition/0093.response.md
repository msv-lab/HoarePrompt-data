Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, the last element in `N` is at least 1, and `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i` for the current value of `i`; `cur` is equal to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `M`, `S`, `N`, and `cur` remain unchanged, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
