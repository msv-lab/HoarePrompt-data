Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary with keys as numbers from `N` (or up to the last number before a gap) and values as the count of consecutive occurrences, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is `x + 2`, `i` is `x + 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `cur`, and `i` remain unchanged.
