Output State: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `cur` is either -1, 0, or the value of `num` if `num > cur`, and `num` is the next element in `N` (i.e., `num_next`). The value at key `cur` in `M` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` has been increased by 1. All other variables (`S`, `N`, `cur`, `num`) retain their previous values.
