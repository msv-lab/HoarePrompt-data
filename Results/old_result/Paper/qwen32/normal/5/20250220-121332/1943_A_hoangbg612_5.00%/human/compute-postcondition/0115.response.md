Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is 0, and `num` is an integer greater than `cur` (which is 0); we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
