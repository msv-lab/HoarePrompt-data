The code snippet provided assigns the value `-1` to the variable `cur`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `T`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` < `n`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `cur` is -1.**
