Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, and `cur` is either -1, 0, or the value of `num` if `num > cur`, and `num` is the next element in `N` (i.e., `num_next`). If `num > cur`, `M[cur]` is assigned the value `1` and `cur` is updated to `num`. If `num <= cur`, the value at key `cur` in `M` is incremented by 1.**
