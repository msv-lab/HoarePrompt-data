To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `cur`.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(cur):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `cur`.

From the description of the previous state:
- `cur` is equal to the incremented value of `i` if `M[i] <= i`. Otherwise, `cur` retains its value and `i` is incremented by 1.

Let's break this down into two cases:

**Case 1: M[i] <= i**
- `cur` is incremented by 1, so `cur` becomes `i + 1`.
- `i` is also incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.

**Case 2: M[i] > i**
- `cur` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.

Since we are looking for the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens after `i` is incremented by 1 in both cases.

**Case 1: M[i] <= i**
- After `i` is incremented, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `cur` is also `i + 1` (since it was incremented).
- The loop will execute again because `i` (which is now `i + 1`) is less than `cur` (which is also `i + 1`).

**Case 2: M[i] > i**
- After `i` is incremented, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `cur` remains the same.
- The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now `i + 1`) is less than `cur`.

Since we need to describe the state at the start of the next iteration, we consider the following:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `cur` remains the same if `M[i] > i`, or `cur` is also incremented by 1 if `M[i] <= i`.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `cur` will depend on the condition `M[i] <= i` from the previous iteration.

State: **`cur` is equal to the incremented value of `i` if `M[i] <= i`, otherwise `cur` retains its value, and `i` is incremented by 1**.

However, to provide a specific state without assumptions about `M[i]`, we can say:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1**. If `M[i] <= i` in the previous iteration, then `cur` is also incremented by 1; otherwise, `cur` retains its value. Since we don't have the value of `M[i]`, we can't definitively state the value of `cur`, but we know `i` has been incremented.

State: **`i` is incremented by 1**.
