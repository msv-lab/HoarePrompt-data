The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range it iterates over, which is `cur`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `cur` so that it is greater than 0. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is initialized by the `range` function.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `cur` is greater than 0.
2. The initial state mentions that `cur` is the highest number in `N` that is consecutively reachable starting from -1, and it may be incremented by 1 if a certain condition involving `M` and `S` is met.
3. To ensure the loop executes, we need `cur` to be at least 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `cur` is greater than 0.

State: **`cur` must be greater than 0**
