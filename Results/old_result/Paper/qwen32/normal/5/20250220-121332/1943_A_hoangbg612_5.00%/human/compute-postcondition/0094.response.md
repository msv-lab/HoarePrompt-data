Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts in `N`, `S` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged, and the last element in `N` is at least 1. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the condition `M[i] > i` holds and no change is made to `cur`.**
