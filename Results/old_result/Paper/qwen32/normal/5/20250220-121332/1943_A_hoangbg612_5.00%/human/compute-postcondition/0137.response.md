Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `S` is an input integer, `num` is the next integer in the list `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[num]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged or is updated to `num - 1` if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, and `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.**
