Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `cur` is either -1 or 0, and `num` is a value that determines `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` contains `cur` as the key with a value of 1. Otherwise, `M` contains the entry {-1: 1} and `cur` remains -1.**
