Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.**
