To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider how the loop processes each element in the list `nums`. The loop iterates over each element `i` in `nums` and updates `curr` based on the condition `if i != 0`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `last` is the last element of `nums`.
   - `curr` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `i` in `nums`:
     - If `i` is not 0, then `curr` is updated by adding `i - last` to it.
     - If `i` is 0, `curr` remains unchanged.
   - `last` remains the same throughout the loop.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop finishes, `_` will have been incremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `nums` remains unchanged.
   - `last` remains the same as it was initially (the last element of `nums`).
   - `curr` will be the sum of all `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`.

Let's formalize the final value of `curr`:
- `curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all `i` in `nums` where `i != 0`.

In natural language:
- The variable `_` will have been incremented by the number of elements in `nums` (since the loop iterates over each element).
- The variable `t` remains the same as it was initially.
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was initially.
- The variable `nums` remains unchanged.
- The variable `last` remains the same as it was initially (the last element of `nums`).
- The variable `curr` is the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by the length of `nums`, `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `nums` remains the same, `last` remains the same, `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` where `i != 0`.**
