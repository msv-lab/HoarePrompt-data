The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is the iteration variable for the `nums` list. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and how it relates to the `nums` list.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4.
- `n` is the new input integer.
- `nums` is the new list of integers read from input and must have at least 1 element.
- `last` is the last element of `nums`.
- `i` is the second-to-last element of `nums`.
- If `i` is not equal to 0, `curr` is increased by `i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the second-to-last element of `nums`. In the next iteration, `i` will take the value of the next element in the list. Therefore, `i` needs to be updated to the next element in `nums`.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in `nums` as `idx`. Since `i` was the second-to-last element, `idx` is `len(nums) - 2`. In the next iteration, `i` will be `nums[idx + 1]`.

To summarize:
- `i` should be updated to the next element in `nums`, which is `nums[len(nums) - 1]` (the last element of `nums`).

However, since we are considering the state at the start of the next iteration, and `i` will be the next element in the list, we need to ensure that there is a next element. This means `nums` must have more than one element for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input and must have more than 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the last element of `nums`**.
