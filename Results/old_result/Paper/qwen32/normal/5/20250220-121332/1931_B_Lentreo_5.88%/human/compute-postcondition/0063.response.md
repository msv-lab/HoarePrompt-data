Postcondition: **`_` is incremented by the length of `nums`, `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `nums` remains the same, `last` remains the same, and `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all `i` in `nums` where `i != 0`. If `curr` is 0, no additional changes occur. Otherwise, `curr` is not equal to 0.**
