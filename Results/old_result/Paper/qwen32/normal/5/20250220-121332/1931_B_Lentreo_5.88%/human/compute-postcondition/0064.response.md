Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, it has read an integer `n`, a list of `n` integers `nums`, computed `last` as the last element of `nums`, and calculated `curr` as the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`. If `curr` is 0, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, `t` is decremented to 0, and no further iterations occur.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations are complete, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it will have determined whether the sum of the differences between each non-zero element and the last element is zero. If it is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The loop counter `t` will be zero, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
