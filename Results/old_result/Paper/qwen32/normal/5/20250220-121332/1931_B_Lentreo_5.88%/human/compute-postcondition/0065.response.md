Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `a`, and the list `a` itself which contains `n` integers. The function returns the average of the integers in the list `a` for each test case, given that the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`.**
