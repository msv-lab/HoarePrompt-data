To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each element in the list `nums`.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `nums`. If `i` is not equal to 0, it updates the variable `curr` by adding the difference between `i` and `last` (the last element of `nums`). If `i` is 0, `curr` remains unchanged.

Let's break down the process:

1. The loop starts with `curr` initialized to 0.
2. For each element `i` in `nums` (from the first to the last element), the loop checks if `i` is not 0.
3. If `i` is not 0, it updates `curr` by adding `i - last`.
4. The variable `last` remains the last element of `nums` throughout the loop, and it does not change.

The final value of `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`.

Given the initial state and the loop logic, the output state after all iterations can be described as:

- `t` remains the same integer read from input.
- `n` remains the same integer input.
- `nums` remains the same list of integers.
- `last` remains the last element of `nums`.
- `curr` is the final updated value after processing all elements in `nums`.

The final value of `curr` is computed as the sum of the differences between each non-zero element `i` in `nums` and the last element `last`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, and `curr` is the sum of (i - last) for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`.**

In simpler terms: The final output state is that `curr` has been updated to the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
