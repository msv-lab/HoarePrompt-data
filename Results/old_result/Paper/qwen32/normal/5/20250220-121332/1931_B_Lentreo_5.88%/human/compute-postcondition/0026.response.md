Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `nums` is the new list of integers read from input, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `curr` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `curr` has been assigned the value 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, and `last`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
