Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least two elements, `i` is the next element in `nums` after the last one considered, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`.**

In this output state, the value of `curr` has been updated by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to its previous value. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, and `i`) retain their initial states as described in the initial conditions.
