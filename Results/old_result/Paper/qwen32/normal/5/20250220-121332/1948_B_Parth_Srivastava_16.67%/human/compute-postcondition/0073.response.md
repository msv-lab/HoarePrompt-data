The code snippet `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. The values of `t`, `a`, `k`, `i`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only change is that `c` now includes the value of `x` at the end of the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` has `y` appended to it and now `x` is also appended to `c`.**
