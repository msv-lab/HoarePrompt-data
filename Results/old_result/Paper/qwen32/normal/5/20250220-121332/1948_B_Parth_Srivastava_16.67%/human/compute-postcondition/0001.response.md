The code snippet `a = input()` changes the variable `a` to hold the value of the input, which is a string. The previous value of `a`, which was a list of integers, is overwritten.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a string (the input value), and `k` is an input integer.**
