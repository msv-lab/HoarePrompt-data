Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, and `y >= c[n - 1]`, then if `y <= x`, `c` includes `y` followed by `x` at the end of the list and `n` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element and `n` is increased by 1. If `i` was 0 and `a[i]` was greater than 10, then if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `c` has `y` appended followed by `x`, and `n` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `c` includes `a[i]` as its new last element. If `i` was not 0 or `a[i]` was not greater than 10, `c` includes `a[i]` at the end, and `n` is `n + 1`.**
