Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; for each test case, `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers (the input value split and converted from a string), and `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `c` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10; if `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, then `n` is either 1 or 2, and `c` is a list containing `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, or just the element `a[i]` if `y` is greater than `x`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`, `c` contains `y` and `x` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, or just `a[i]` if `y` is greater than `x`. Otherwise, if `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, then `n` is 2 if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `n` is 1, and `c` is a list containing `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `c` is a list containing `a[i]`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i] <= 10`, `n` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10; `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, then if `y >= c[n - 1]` and `y <= x`, `c` includes `y` and `x` appended at the end, and `n` is `n + 2`. If `y >= c[n - 1]` and `y > x`, `c` contains the element `a[i]` at the end, and `n` is `n + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i] > 10`, then `n` is 2 if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `n` is 1, and `c` is a list containing `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `c` is a list containing `a[i]`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i] <= 10`, `n` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`. If `i > 0` and `a[i] > 10` and `y < c[n - 1]`, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element; `n` is `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, and `y >= c[n - 1]`, then if `y <= x`, `c` includes `y` followed by `x` at the end of the list and `n` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element and `n` is increased by 1. If `i` was 0 and `a[i]` was greater than 10, then if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `c` has `y` appended followed by `x`, and `n` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `c` includes `a[i]` as its new last element. If `i` was not 0 or `a[i]` was not greater than 10, `c` includes `a[i]` at the end, and `n` is `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
