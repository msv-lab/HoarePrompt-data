### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and checks if an element is greater than 10.
   - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its tens and units digits.
   - The logic for splitting and inserting digits depends on the position of the element in the array (`i > 0` or `i == 0`).
   - After processing the list, it checks if the resulting list `c` is sorted.
   - It appends `1` to the list `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise it appends `0`.

2. **Main Program:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints "YES" if the corresponding value in `b` is `1`, otherwise it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for splitting and inserting digits is flawed.
  - The program does not correctly handle the insertion of digits in the same position.
  - The condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` is not sufficient to ensure the correct order.
  - The program does not handle cases where multiple splits are needed correctly.
- The program does not consider the possibility of multiple splits affecting the order of elements that come after the split.
- The sorting check is done on the modified list `c`, but the logic for creating `c` is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the logic for splitting and inserting digits, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
