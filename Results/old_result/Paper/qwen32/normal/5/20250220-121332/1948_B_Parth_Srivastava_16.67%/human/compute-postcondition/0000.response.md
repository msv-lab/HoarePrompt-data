The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `k`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State will include the new value of `k` and the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, and `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `k` is an input integer.**
