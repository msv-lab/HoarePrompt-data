Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` was 0 and `a[i]` was greater than 10, then if `y` (the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10) is less than or equal to `x` (the last digit of `a[i]`), `c` has `y` appended followed by `x`, and `n` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `c` includes `a[i]` as its new last element. If `i` was not 0 or `a[i]` was not greater than 10, `c` includes `a[i]` at the end, and `n` is `n + 1`.**
