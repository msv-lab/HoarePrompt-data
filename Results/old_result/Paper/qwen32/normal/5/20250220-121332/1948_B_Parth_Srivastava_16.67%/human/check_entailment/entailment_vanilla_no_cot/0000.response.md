Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the described operations. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Digit Splitting**: The program does not correctly handle the splitting of numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. The logic to split and insert digits is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**: The program incorrectly compares digits and elements to determine if the array can be sorted. Specifically, the conditions and logic for inserting digits and checking if the array is sorted are not correctly implemented.

3. **Incorrect Use of Variables**: The program uses variables `x`, `y`, and `n` in a way that does not reflect the intended logic. For example, `x` and `y` are used to store the digits of a number, but they are not used consistently or correctly.

4. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the array is sorted after processing, but the processing logic is flawed, so the check will not yield the correct result.

Here is an example of how the program might fail:

Consider the input:
```
1
4
12 3 28 5
```

The program might try to split `12` into `1` and `2`, but the logic for insertion and comparison is incorrect, leading to an incorrect conclusion that the array cannot be sorted.

To fix the program, the logic for splitting numbers and inserting digits needs to be corrected, and the comparison logic needs to ensure that the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.
