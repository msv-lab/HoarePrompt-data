The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`
- `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10
- `i` is `i + 1` (implying `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration)

The loop condition is `for i in range(len(a))`, which means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.

Since `i` was incremented at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, we simply need to ensure `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value, provided `i` is still less than the length of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `i` is `i + 1`**
