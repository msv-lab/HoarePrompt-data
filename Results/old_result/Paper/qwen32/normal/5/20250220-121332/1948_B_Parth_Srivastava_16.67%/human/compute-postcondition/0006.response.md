The code snippet provided initializes an empty list `c`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; for each test case, `n` is 0, `a` is a list of integers (the input value split and converted from a string), and `k` is an input integer; `x` is 0; `y` is 0; `c` is an empty list.**
