The code snippet `y = int(a[i] / 10)` updates the value of `y` by performing integer division of the `i`-th element of the list `a` by 10. Given that `a[i]` is greater than 10, `y` will be the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 0; `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10; `c` is an empty list; `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0.**
