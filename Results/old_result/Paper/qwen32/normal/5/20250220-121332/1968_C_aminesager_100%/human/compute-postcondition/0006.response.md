The provided Python code snippet initializes a list `a` with a single element, `1000`. The values of `t`, `n`, `T`, and `line` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a non-zero integer minus 1
- `n` is the integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500)
- `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`
- `line` is the string input by the user

After executing the code snippet `a = [1000]`, the only change is the creation of the list `a` with the value `[1000]`.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer minus 1, `n` is the integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`, `line` is the string input by the user, `a` is `[1000]`**.
