The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`, `line` is the new string input by the user, `a` is `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1]]`, `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`, `i` is 3**
