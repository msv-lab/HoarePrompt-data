### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior using the annotated code to ensure it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The array `a` is initialized with `a[0] = 1000`. This is a valid starting point since `1000` is within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Loop**:
   - For each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, the program sets `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` is always greater than `a[i-1]` and `a[i]` remains within the range `[1, 10^9]` as long as `T[i-1]` is within `[1, 500]` and `a[i-1]` does not exceed `10^9 - 500`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` needs to be verified. Given the construction `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`, we have:
     - `a[i] % a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + T[i-1]) % a[i-1] = T[i-1] % a[i-1]`.
     - Since `T[i-1] < a[i-1]` (because `T[i-1]` is at most `500` and `a[i-1]` starts from `1000` and increases by at most `500` each time), `T[i-1] % a[i-1] = T[i-1]`.
     - Therefore, `a[i] % a[i-1] = T[i-1] = x_i`, which satisfies the condition.

### Validation:
- The annotations confirm that `a` is constructed as `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], ..., 1000 + sum(T[0] to T[n-2])]`.
- The annotations also confirm that `a[i] % a[i-1] = T[i-1]` for all `2 <= i <= n`, which means `a[i] % a[i-1] = x_i`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs the array `a` such that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n` and ensures that all `a_i` are within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**. The program correctly constructs the required array `a` for all valid inputs as per the problem description.
