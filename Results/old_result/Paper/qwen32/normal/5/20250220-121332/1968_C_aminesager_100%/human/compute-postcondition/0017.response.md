Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`, `line` is the string input by the user, `a` is `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]]`, `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, changing from 1 to 0. All other variables (`n`, `T`, `line`, `a`, and `result`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
