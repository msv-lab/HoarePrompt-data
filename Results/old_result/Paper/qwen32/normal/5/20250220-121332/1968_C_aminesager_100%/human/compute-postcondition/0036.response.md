Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the new string `line`, `line` is the new string input by the user, `a` is [1000], `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`**

In this output state, the variable `a` has been re-initialized to `[1000]`, while all other variables retain their previous values.
