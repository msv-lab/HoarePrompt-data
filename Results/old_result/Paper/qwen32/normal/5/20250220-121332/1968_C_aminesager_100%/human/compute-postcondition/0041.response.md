The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the new string `line`, `line` is the new string input by the user, `a` is [1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1]], `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`, `i` is 3**
