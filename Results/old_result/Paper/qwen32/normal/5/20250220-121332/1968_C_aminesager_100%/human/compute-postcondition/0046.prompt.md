Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 500), `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` are a list of n-1 integers (1 <= x_i <= 500)
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a non-zero integer minus 1, `n` is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`, `line` is the string input by the user, `a` is `[1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]]`, `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer value provided by user input (2 <= n <= 500), `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting the string `line`, `line` is the new string input by the user, `a` is [1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], ..., (1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2]) + T[n-1]], `result` is a string that is the space-separated concatenation of the elements of `a`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` remains a non-zero integer decreased by 1; `n` remains the input integer (2 <= n <= 500); `T` remains the list of integers derived from splitting the new string `line`; `line` remains the new string input by the user; `a` remains `[1000, 1000 + T[0], (1000 + T[0]) + T[1], \ldots, 1000 + \sum_{j=0}^{n-2} T[j]]`; `result` is the space-separated string of the elements in `a`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
