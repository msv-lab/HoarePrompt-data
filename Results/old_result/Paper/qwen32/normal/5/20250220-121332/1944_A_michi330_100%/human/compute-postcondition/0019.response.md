Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. The integer `n` represents the number of elements in a set, and `k` represents a specific number of pairs that can be formed from the set. The function returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is within the valid range of 0 to \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), the function returns a specific result for each test case.**
