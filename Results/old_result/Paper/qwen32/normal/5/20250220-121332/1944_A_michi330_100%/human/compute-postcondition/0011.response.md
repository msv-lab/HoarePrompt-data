Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:
- `t` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but its value is not relevant to the `print(n)` statement.

The `print(n)` statement will output the value of `n`, which is the first integer from the input.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the first integer from the input)**
