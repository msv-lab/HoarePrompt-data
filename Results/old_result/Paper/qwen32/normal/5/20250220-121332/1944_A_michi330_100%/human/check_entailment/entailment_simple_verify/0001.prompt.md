You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers n and k where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}. There are multiple test cases, with the number of test cases t satisfying 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
def func():

        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the values of `n` and `k` are read from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the number `1` is printed; otherwise, the number `n` is printed. The variables `n` and `k` are updated with new values from the input in each iteration, but `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem describes a scenario with `n` islands where every pair of islands is initially connected by a bridge. Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit starting from island 1. The goal is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater optimally destroys up to `k` bridges.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial Connectivity**: Initially, all islands are connected, meaning Everule can visit all `n` islands.
2. **Dominater's Action**: Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges. The aim is to disconnect as many islands from island 1 as possible.
3. **Graph Theory Insight**: The problem can be viewed as a graph problem where islands are nodes and bridges are edges. Everule starts at node 1 and can visit all nodes connected to node 1. Dominater's goal is to maximize the number of disconnected components by removing edges.
4. **Critical Insight**: To disconnect island 1 from the maximum number of other islands, Dominater should aim to remove the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph minus the edge connected to island 1. The MST of a complete graph with `n` nodes has `n-1` edges. Therefore, if `k >= n-1`, Dominater can disconnect all islands from island 1, leaving only island 1 accessible. If `k < n-1`, Dominater cannot disconnect all islands from island 1, so Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

### Program Analysis

The provided program follows the logic derived from the key observations:

- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` (number of islands) and `k` (number of bridges Dominater can destroy).
- If `k >= n-1`, it prints `1` (indicating only island 1 is reachable).
- Otherwise, it prints `n` (indicating all islands are reachable).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic derived from the problem analysis. It handles all edge cases, including when `k` is exactly `n-1` and when `k` is `0`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
