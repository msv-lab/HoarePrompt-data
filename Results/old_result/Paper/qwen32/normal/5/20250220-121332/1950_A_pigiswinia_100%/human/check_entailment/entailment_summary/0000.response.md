Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three integers and checks if they form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither. The conditions are correctly implemented using chained comparisons:

- For a "STAIR", the condition `a < b < c` is used, which checks if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`.
- For a "PEAK", the condition `a < b > c` is used, which checks if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`.
- If neither condition is met, it correctly outputs "NONE".

The execution summary matches the program's behavior, indicating that it reads the input as specified and prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions given.

Correctness: **True**
