The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

This statement prints the string `'PEAK'` directly. The initial state describes variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **PEAK**
