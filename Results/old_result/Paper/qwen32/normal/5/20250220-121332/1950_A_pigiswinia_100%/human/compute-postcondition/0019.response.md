The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, and `i` is 2**.
