Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, and `i` is not yet initialized. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`. Otherwise, either `a < b > c` or it is not the case that `a < b < c` and `a < b > c`.**
