Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, and `i` is 1. The condition `a < b > c` determines the path taken: if true, the state remains as described in the if part; if false, the state remains as described in the else part. In either case, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` are unchanged.**
