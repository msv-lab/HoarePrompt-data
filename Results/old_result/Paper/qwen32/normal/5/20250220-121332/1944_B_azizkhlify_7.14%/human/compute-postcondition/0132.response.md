Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is a variable (its value is not specified, so we'll ignore it for this print statement).
- `ul` is either `k * 2` or 0 (its value is not directly relevant to this print statement).
- `ur` is 0 (its value is not directly relevant to this print statement).
- `n` is 2 (its value is not directly relevant to this print statement).
- `k` is the second input integer (its value is not directly relevant to this print statement).
- `a` is a list of integers from the input (this is relevant to the print statement).
- `l` is a list of 2 elements where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of the integer `j+1` in the list `a` (its value is not directly relevant to this print statement).
- `r` is [0, 1] (its value is not directly relevant to this print statement).
- `re` is 0 (its value is not directly relevant to this print statement).
- `res` is an empty list (its value is not directly relevant to this print statement).
- `i` is 1 (this is relevant to the print statement).

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```
From the initial state, we know that `i` is 1. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

### Output Determination:
The print statement will output the element at index 1 of the list `a` twice, followed by a space. Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't specify the exact numerical values. However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
