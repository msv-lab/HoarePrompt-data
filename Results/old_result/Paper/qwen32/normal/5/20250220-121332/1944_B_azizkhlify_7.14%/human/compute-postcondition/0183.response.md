To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`res`**: A list with at least one element.
2. **`i`**: The last element of the list `res`. Therefore, `i = res[-1]`.
3. **`ul`**: Not equal to `ur`. This information is not directly relevant to the print statement.
4. **`n`**: A non-negative integer. This information is also not directly relevant to the print statement.
5. **`r[a[i] - 1]`**: Equals 2. This means that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is 2. This information is not directly relevant to the print statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is printing `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and the `end=' '` argument means that instead of a newline, a space will be printed after the last value.

- **`a[i]`**: Since `i` is the last element of `res`, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. However, the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified in the initial state. We only know that `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, which gives us a condition on `a[i]` but not its exact value.

### Conclusion:
Given that the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we can describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a, and i is the last element of the list res)**
