The given `print` statement is `print(i, end=' ')`. Based on the initial state provided, we need to determine the value of `i`.

From the initial state, we have the following relevant information:
- `i` is explicitly mentioned to be 1.

Since `i` is directly given as 1, there is no need to compute or derive its value from any formulas or conditions. The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that after printing `i`, a space should be added instead of the default newline character.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
