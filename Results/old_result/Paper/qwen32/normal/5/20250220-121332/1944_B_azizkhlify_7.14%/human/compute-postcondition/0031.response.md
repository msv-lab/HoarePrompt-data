To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
2. `n` is an integer such that n >= 1.
3. `k` is the second integer from the input.
4. `a` is a list of integers.
5. `l` is a list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`.
6. `r` is a list of `n` integers.
7. `re` is initialized to 0.
8. `ul` is 2 if the i-th element of `a` satisfies `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ul` is 0.
9. `ur` is initialized to 0.
10. `res` is an empty list.
11. `i` is incremented by 1.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

To understand what will be printed, we need to know the value of `i` and the content of the list `a`.

From the initial state, it is mentioned that `i` is incremented by 1. However, we do not have the initial value of `i`, so we can assume that `i` starts from 0 (a common starting index for lists in Python). If `i` is incremented by 1, then `i` will be 1 when this `print` statement is executed.

Given that `a` is a list of integers, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is 1 after the increment, `a[i]` will be the element at index 1 of the list `a`.

Thus, the `print` statement will print the element at index 1 of the list `a` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end due to the `end=' '` argument.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the element at index 1 of the list `a`)**
