Output State: **`t` is defined, `ul` is defined, `ur` is increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, otherwise `ur` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, and `i` remain as per their initial state, except that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
