Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `ul` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not change the values of `n`, `i`, or `ul`. Therefore, `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, and `ul` remains unchanged.
