To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it terminates.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over the range `n` to `2*n`.
2. **Condition**: The loop checks if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. If true, it prints `a[i]` twice and increments `ur` by 2.
3. **Break Condition**: The loop breaks if `ul` equals `ur`.

### Initial State:
- The loop prints all elements in `res` separated by spaces, and `i` is the last element of `res`.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur` initially.

### Output State after 3 Iterations:
- `res` remains a list with at least one element.
- `i` is the last element of `res` plus 2.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur` if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.
- `ur` is increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2; otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.
- The loop breaks if `ul` equals `ur`.

### Final Output State:
The loop will continue to iterate until `i` reaches `2*n - 1` unless the break condition (`ul == ur`) is met. Since the break condition is checked after each iteration and the problem specifies that `ul` is not equal to `ur` initially, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `2*n - 1` unless `ul` becomes equal to `ur` during the iterations.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be determined by the last value of `i` before the loop terminates, which is `2*n - 1` unless `ul` equals `ur` before reaching that point. The values of `ul` and `ur` will be the final values before the loop breaks or completes all iterations.

### Final Output State:
- `i` will be `2*n - 1` if the loop completes all iterations without `ul` equaling `ur`.
- `ur` will be incremented by 2 for every iteration where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
- `ul` will remain unchanged unless it equals `ur` during the iterations, at which point the loop breaks.

Output State: **The loop prints all elements in `res` separated by spaces, and `i` is `2*n - 1` unless the loop breaks due to `ul` equaling `ur`. `ur` is incremented by 2 for every iteration where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. `ul` remains unchanged unless it equals `ur` during the iterations.**
