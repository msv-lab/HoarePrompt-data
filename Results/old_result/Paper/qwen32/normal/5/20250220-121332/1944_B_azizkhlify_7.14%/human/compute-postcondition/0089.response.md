The code snippet `ur += 2` increases the value of `ur` by 2. Given the initial state, `t`, `ul`, and `ur` are defined, with `ul` not equal to `ur` unless the if condition is true, in which case `ul` equals `ur` and the loop or if statement is broken out of. `n` is at least 1, and `i` is `n + 1`. The specific value of `ur` is not given, but it is increased by 2 as per the code.

Output State: **`t` is defined, `ul` is defined, `ur` is increased by 2, `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`.**
