The code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input.**
