The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `n` should remain the same as it determines the total number of iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values from the input line to integers; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except for the element at index `a[i] - 1` which is 2; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 2**
