The code increments the value of `ur` by 2. The values of `res`, `i`, `n`, and the condition of `ul` being equal to `ur` are not affected by this operation. If `ul` was originally equal to `ur`, it will no longer be equal to `ur` after the increment. If `ul` was not equal to `ur`, this condition remains unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `res` plus 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is increased by 2, and `ul` is not equal to `ur` if it was originally equal to `ur`. Otherwise, the condition of `ul` being not equal to `ur` remains unchanged.**
