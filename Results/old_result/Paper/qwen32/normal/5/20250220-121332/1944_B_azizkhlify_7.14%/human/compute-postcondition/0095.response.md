The code snippet `ur += 2` increases the value of `ur` by 2. The other variables (`t`, `ul`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is defined, `ul` is defined, `ur` is increased by 2, `n` is at least 1, and `i` is `n + 2`. If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
