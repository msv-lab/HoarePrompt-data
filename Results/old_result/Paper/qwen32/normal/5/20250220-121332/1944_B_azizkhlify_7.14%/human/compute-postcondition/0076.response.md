To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the components involved in the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive).
2. **`n`**: An integer greater than or equal to 1.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers.
4. **`l`**: A list where the i-th element is the count of occurrences of integer i+1 in the list `a`.
5. **`r`**: A list of `n` integers.
6. **`ul`**: The sum of 2 for each element in `a` that appears exactly twice in the list `l` up to the point where the loop breaks or completes all iterations.
7. **`ur`**: Initialized to 0.
8. **`res`**: A list containing at least two elements.
9. **`i`**: The next element in `res` after the current `i`.
10. **`re`**: The number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1 up to the point where the loop breaks or completes, but this is only relevant if `k` is not zero.

### Focus on `print(i, end=' ')`:
The statement `print(i, end=' ')` will print the value of `i` followed by a space, without a newline at the end.

### Determining the Value of `i`:
From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is the next element in the list `res` after the current `i`.
- `res` is a list containing at least two elements.

Since `i` is described as "the next element in `res` after the current `i`," it implies that `i` is an element of the list `res`. However, the exact value of `i` cannot be determined without knowing the specific contents of `res`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i`, but we know it is an element of the list `res`.

### Final Output:
Output: **i (where i is an element of the list `res`)**
