Postcondition: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step. If `player[p]` was equal to `blud`, then the position of player `p` is set to `[-1, -1]`, the position of other players remains unchanged, `blud` is a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` is a list containing the player identifier `p`. If `player[p]` was not equal to `blud`, then the position of player `p` and other players remains unchanged, `blud` remains a list of two integers representing the position of the Bludger on the field, and `out` remains an empty list.**
