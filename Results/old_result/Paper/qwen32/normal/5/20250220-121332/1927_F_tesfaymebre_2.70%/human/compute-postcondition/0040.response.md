To determine the output state after the execution of `dsu.union(u, v, w)`, we need to understand the impact of the union operation on the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure. The union operation typically merges the sets containing elements `u` and `v` and can update various attributes such as the parent pointers and possibly the minimum edge weights.

Given the initial state, the union operation will:
1. Merge the sets containing `u` and `v`.
2. Update the parent pointers of the smaller tree to point to the root of the larger tree (union by rank).
3. Update the minimum edge weight for the merged set if necessary.

Since the exact implementation of the DSU class is not provided, we will assume typical behaviors for union operations in DSU structures.

### Impact on Variables:
- `dsu`: The internal state of the DSU object is updated to reflect the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`.
- `parent_u` and `parent_v`: These variables remain the same unless they were the roots of the sets being merged, in which case `parent_v` would be updated to point to `parent_u` (or vice versa, depending on the implementation).
- `_min_edge`: This variable is updated to the minimum edge weight of the merged set if `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v` and `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` was less than `_min_edge`.
- `node_u` and `node_v`: These variables remain `-1` unless `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v`, in which case they are set to `u` and `v` respectively.

### Output State:
Assuming `dsu.union(u, v, w)` successfully merges the sets and updates the necessary attributes, the output state would be:

Output State: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times; `edges` is a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple; `dsu` is a DSU object with updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new parent pointers after the union; `_min_edge` is updated to the minimum edge weight of the merged set if necessary; `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively if `parent_u` was equal to `parent_v`, otherwise they remain `-1`.**

In simpler terms, the DSU object `dsu` is updated to reflect the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`. The parent pointers `parent_u` and `parent_v` might be updated, and the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and nodes `node_u` and `node_v` are updated based on the conditions specified.
