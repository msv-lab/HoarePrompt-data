The code snippet assigns the result of the function `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. Since the initial state does not provide any information about the return value of `func_1()`, we can only infer that `test_cases` will hold whatever value `func_1()` returns. No other variables are mentioned or affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` holds the value returned by `func_1()`**.
