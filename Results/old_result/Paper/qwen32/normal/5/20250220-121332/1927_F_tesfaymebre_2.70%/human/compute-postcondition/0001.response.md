In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `test_cases`, which is the value returned by the function `func_1()`. The loop head only involves the variable `_` and `test_cases`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not need to be initialized before the loop, the only variable we need to adjust is `test_cases`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. If `test_cases` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
