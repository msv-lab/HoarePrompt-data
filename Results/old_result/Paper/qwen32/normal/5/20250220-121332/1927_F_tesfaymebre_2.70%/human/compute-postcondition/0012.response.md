Postcondition: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex to avoid revisiting, and `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it. `colors[curr]` is 1. `graph[curr]` must be a list with at least one element. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`. `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. The condition `(res and node_v in set_res)` is false, meaning either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`. If `colors[nei]` is 2 or `nei` is equal to `parent`, no changes are made to `res` or `set_res`.**
