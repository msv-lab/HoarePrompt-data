Postcondition: **`graph` is a defaultdict with a default factory of `list` where each `u` and `v` pair (returned by `func_3()`) have their respective connections recorded `m` times. `edges` is a list of `m-1` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by weight, and must contain at least one tuple. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `dsu` is a DSU object with updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, and `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, otherwise `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`. If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, `dsu` is a DSU object with updated internal state reflecting the union of the sets containing `u` and `v`, `_min_edge` is updated to the weight of the edge between `u` and `v`, and `node_u` and `node_v` are set to `u` and `v` respectively. `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new parent pointers after the union.**
