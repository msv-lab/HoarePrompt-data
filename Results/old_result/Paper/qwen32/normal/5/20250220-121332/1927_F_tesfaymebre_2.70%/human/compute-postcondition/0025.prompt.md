Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex to avoid revisiting, and `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it. `colors[curr]` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex to avoid revisiting, and `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it. `colors[curr]` is 1. `graph[curr]` must be a list with at least one element. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`. `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. The condition `(res and node_v in set_res)` is false, meaning either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`. If `colors[nei]` is 2 or `nei` is equal to `parent`, no changes are made to `res` or `set_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` is a list with at least one element, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`, `res` is the result of `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the program returns `res`. Otherwise, the program does not return and continues with the next statements. If `colors[nei] == 2` or `nei == parent`, the program does not execute the if block and continues with the next statements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` is a list with at least one element, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[curr]`. If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, and if `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in the set `set_res`, the function returns the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, which is stored in the variable `res`. Otherwise, no return value is specified for the else part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
