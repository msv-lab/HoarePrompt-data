The function constructs a graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, then identifies the minimum edge weight in a spanning tree and performs a depth-first search starting from the node associated with this minimum edge. It prints the minimum edge weight and the number of nodes in the resulting path, followed by the sequence of nodes in the path.
