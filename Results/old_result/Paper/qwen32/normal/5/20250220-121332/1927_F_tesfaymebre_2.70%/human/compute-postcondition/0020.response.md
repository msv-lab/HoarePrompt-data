Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` is a list with at least one element, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[curr]` (specifically, the element after the current `nei`), `res` is the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`**

In this output state, the variable `res` is assigned the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
