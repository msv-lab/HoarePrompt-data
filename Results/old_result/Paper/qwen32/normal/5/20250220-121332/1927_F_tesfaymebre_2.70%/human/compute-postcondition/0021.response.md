The code snippet `set_res = set(res)` converts the `res` list into a set and assigns it to `set_res`. This operation does not change the values of `curr`, `parent`, `path`, `colors[curr]`, `graph[curr]`, or `nei`. It only introduces a new variable `set_res` which holds the set representation of `res`.

Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, `colors[curr]` is 1, `graph[curr]` is a list with at least one element, `nei` is the next neighbor in `graph[curr]` (specifically, the element after the current `nei`), `res` is the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`.**
