### Reasoning:

The problem involves determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by drawing diagonals between chosen vertices of a regular polygon. Here, Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, and we are not allowed to choose any additional vertices (`y = 0`). The goal is to maximize the number of triangular pieces using only the `x` vertices.

To solve this, the program follows these steps:
1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of sides of the polygon), `x` (number of chosen vertices), `y` (additional vertices that can be chosen, which is `0` in this case), and the list of `x` chosen vertices.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list of chosen vertices.
3. **Counting Triangles**: It iterates through the sorted list of vertices to count the number of adjacent vertices that are exactly 1 step apart (i.e., they form a side of the polygon). For each such pair, it can form a triangle with the next vertex in the sorted list.
4. **Handling the Wrap-around**: It also checks the gap between the first and last vertices in the sorted list to account for the wrap-around in the polygon.
5. **Final Calculation**: It calculates the number of triangles that can be formed using the formula `count + x - 2`, where `count` is the number of adjacent vertices that are exactly 1 step apart.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly counts the number of adjacent vertices that are 1 step apart, which allows it to form triangles.
- It also correctly handles the wrap-around by checking the gap between the first and last vertices in the sorted list.
- The formula `count + x - 2` accurately calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed using the `x` chosen vertices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
