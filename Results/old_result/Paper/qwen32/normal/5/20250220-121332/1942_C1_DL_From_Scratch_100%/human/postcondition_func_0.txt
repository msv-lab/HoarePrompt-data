The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the gaps between the integers in the list and the positions of the smallest and largest integers relative to `n`.
