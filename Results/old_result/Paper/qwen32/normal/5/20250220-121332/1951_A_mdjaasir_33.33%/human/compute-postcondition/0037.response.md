The code snippet `a = input()` assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `a`. This means `a` will hold the value entered by the user as a string. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string input by the user**.
