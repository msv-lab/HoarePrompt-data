Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `i + 1`: This line suggests that `i` is incremented by 1, but it doesn't provide the initial value of `i`, so we can't determine the exact value of `i` after this operation.
2. `n` is an input integer: This means `n` holds an integer value provided by the user, but the specific value is not given.
3. `a` is a string input by the user: This means `a` holds a string value provided by the user, but the specific string is not given.
4. `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`: This means `count` is an integer representing the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `a`, but the specific count is not given.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`. None of the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, or `count` are used in this print statement. Therefore, the output is independent of the values of these variables.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
