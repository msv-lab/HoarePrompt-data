Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is the new value provided by the user input.
- `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in the new `a`.
- `i` is `i` + 1.

**Code Snippet:**
```python
print('YES')
```

**Analysis:**
The `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string 'YES' to the console. The values of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `count`, and `i` do not affect this statement because the `print` function is explicitly printing the string 'YES' without referencing any of these variables.

**Output:**
Output: **YES**
