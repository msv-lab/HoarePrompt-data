Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.**

Natural language: The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged and still satisfy the condition that `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input by the user.
