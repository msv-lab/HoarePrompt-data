Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
- `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is the value provided by the user input.
- `count` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `a`, and `count` is exactly 2.
- The first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not immediately followed by another '1'.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('YES')` directly prints the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count`, but none of these variables are used in the print statement. The print statement is independent of the values of these variables and will simply output the string `'YES'`.

### Output:
Output: **YES**
