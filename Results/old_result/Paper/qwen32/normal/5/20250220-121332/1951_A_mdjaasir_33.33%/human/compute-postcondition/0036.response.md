The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `i` is `i + 1`, which implies that `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. The value of `i` before this increment is not specified, so we will keep it as `i + 1` in the output state. The variable `n` is newly introduced and will hold the integer value provided by the user input.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `n` is an input integer**.
