Output State: **For each test case, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` remain the same. The values of `A` and `B` are calculated as `int(m/a) + 1` and `int(m/b) + 1` respectively. The sum `A + B` is printed.**

Natural language: For each test case, the input values `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `A` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `a` plus one, and `B` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `b` plus one. The sum of `A` and `B` is printed.
