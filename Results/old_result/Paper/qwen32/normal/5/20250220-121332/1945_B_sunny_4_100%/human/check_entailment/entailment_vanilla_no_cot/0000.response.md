Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The current implementation simply sums the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and adds 2, which does not account for the overlaps between the fireworks from the two installations.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and then account for the overlaps. The key is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when fireworks from both installations coincide.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        A = m // a + 1
        B = m // b + 1
        AB = m // lcm(a, b) + 1
        ans = A + B - AB
        print(ans)

func()
```

In this corrected version:
- We calculate `A` as the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m`.
- We calculate `B` as the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period `m`.
- We calculate `AB` as the number of fireworks launched by both installations simultaneously within the visibility period `m` (using the least common multiple of `a` and `b`).
- The final answer is `A + B - AB` to account for the overlaps.
