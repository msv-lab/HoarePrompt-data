Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. The fireworks from each installation are launched at regular intervals (every `a` minutes for the first and every `b` minutes for the second) and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after it is launched.

### Key Points
1. **Launch Times**: 
   - For the first installation, fireworks are launched at times `a, 2a, 3a, ...`
   - For the second installation, fireworks are launched at times `b, 2b, 3b, ...`

2. **Visibility**:
   - A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
   - If two fireworks are launched within `m` minutes of each other, they will overlap in visibility.

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine the maximum number of fireworks that overlap in visibility at any point in time.

### Program Analysis
The provided program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the first `m` minutes and adds 2 to the result. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

- **Number of fireworks from the first installation within `m` minutes**: `m // a + 1`
- **Number of fireworks from the second installation within `m` minutes**: `m // b + 1`
- **Total fireworks**: `m // a + m // b + 2`

### Issues with the Program
The program's logic is flawed for several reasons:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program adds 2 to the total count, which is incorrect. There is no justification for adding 2 to the sum of fireworks from both installations.
2. **Overlap Handling**: The program does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. It simply sums the counts of fireworks from each installation, which does not correctly reflect the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the overlap between the intervals of fireworks from both installations. This involves more complex calculations, such as using the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the periodicity of overlapping intervals.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect assumption and calculation of the total number of overlapping fireworks.

**Correctness: False**
