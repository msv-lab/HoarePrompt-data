You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Program:
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(putin())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
    return sub_summ



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` takes two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob. It calculates a sum, `sub_summ`, by adding the first element of each tuple in `sec_arr` and the sum of both elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where the sum of the tuple's elements is non-negative. The function returns this calculated sum.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided Python program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem involves maximizing Alice's profit in a game where she and Bob interact over a set of items. Each item has two prices: one for Alice (`a_i`) and one for Bob (`b_i`). Alice buys items and then Bob can either take them all for free if Alice bought less than `k` items or take `k` items for free and pay for the rest. Alice's profit is the difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends.

### Optimal Strategy

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should aim to buy items such that the difference `b_i - a_i` is maximized, as this will maximize her profit when Bob pays her for the items he buys.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob will take `k` items for free that minimize Alice's profit. This means he will choose items with the smallest `b_i - a_i` values.

### Correctness of the Provided Program

Let's examine the provided functions:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads an integer from the input.
   - It uses a custom function `putin()` which is not defined in the provided code. Assuming `putin()` correctly reads input from `sys.stdin`, this function is correct.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads a line of integers from the input.
   - Similar to `func_1`, it uses `putin()` which is assumed to be correctly implemented.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function calculates Alice's profit.
   - It takes two arguments: `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - `sub_summ` is initialized to 0.
   - The first loop sums up the first element of each tuple in `sec_arr`.
   - The second loop checks if the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` is non-negative and adds it to `sub_summ`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Undefined `putin()` Function**: The function `putin()` is not defined in the provided code, which will result in a `NameError` when the program is run.
2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_3`**:
   - The logic in `func_3` does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
   - The program should sort the items based on the difference `b_i - a_i` to maximize Alice's profit.
   - Bob's strategy of taking `k` items for free should be considered by selecting the `k` items with the smallest `b_i - a_i` values from the items Alice buys.

### Correctness

Given the issues outlined, the provided program is not correct. The logic in `func_3` does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob, and the undefined `putin()` function will cause a runtime error.

**Correctness: False**
