The only object in the loop head is the variable `val_b`, which iterates over each tuple in the list `main_ar`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on whether there are more tuples in `main_ar` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `val_b` was the last tuple in `main_ar`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more tuple in `main_ar`.

Given this, `val_b` should be set to the next tuple in `main_ar`. Since we do not have specific information about the contents of `main_ar` beyond the fact that it must have at least one tuple, we can assume that there is at least one more tuple for the loop to process.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, then `sub_summ` is increased by `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` remains unchanged, `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`**
