Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, which are lists of tuples. Each tuple in these lists contains two integers representing the prices of an item for Alice and Bob, respectively. The function returns `sub_summ`, which is likely a calculated value based on the prices provided in the tuples of `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.**
