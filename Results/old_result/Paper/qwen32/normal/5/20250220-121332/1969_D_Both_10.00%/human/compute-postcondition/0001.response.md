The only variable in the loop head is `val_a`, which iterates over `sec_arr`. For the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must contain at least one tuple. The state of `main_ar`, `sub_summ`, and the tuples within `sec_arr` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, but they are part of the given state.

To ensure the loop executes, `sec_arr` must have at least one tuple. The current state of `val_a` is irrelevant before the loop starts because `val_a` is assigned a value from `sec_arr` during the first iteration.

State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `sub_summ` is 0**
