The given code snippet modifies the value of `sub_summ` by adding the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` (which is the second tuple in `main_ar`). The initial state specifies that `sub_summ` is already calculated based on the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. However, the code snippet provided does not take into account the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0` again. It simply adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ`.

Thus, the value of `sub_summ` will increase by `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` regardless of whether this sum is non-negative or not. The other variables (`main_ar`, `sec_arr`, and `val_b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples, `sub_summ` is the initial `sub_summ` plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`, and `val_b` is the second tuple in `main_ar`.**
