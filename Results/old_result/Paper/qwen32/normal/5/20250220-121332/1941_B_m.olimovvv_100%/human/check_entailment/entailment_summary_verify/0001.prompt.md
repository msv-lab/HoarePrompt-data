You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines if the list can be transformed to all zeros by repeatedly subtracting twice the current element from the next element and the current element from the element after next, starting from the first element. If the transformation is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine if, for a given array, it's possible to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n - 1`) and reduce the elements at `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program iterates over each test case and for each test case, it processes the array as follows:

1. **Initialization:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` in the array.
   - Then, it reads the array `b` of `n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It iterates over the array from index `0` to `a - 3` (i.e., `0` to `n - 3`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `b[i]` is negative. If it is, it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop. This check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that all elements are non-negative.
   - It then modifies the array elements at indices `i+1` and `i+2` by subtracting `2 * b[i]` and `b[i]` respectively from `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]`, and sets `b[i]` to `0`.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are both zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Inaccurate Operation Application:**
   - The program incorrectly modifies the array elements. Instead of reducing the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` by `1`, `2`, and `1` respectively, it incorrectly reduces `b[i+1]` by `2 * b[i]` and `b[i+2]` by `b[i]`. This does not reflect the correct operation described in the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Feasibility:**
   - The program only checks if the last two elements are zero after processing the array. This is not a sufficient condition to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros using the described operation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
