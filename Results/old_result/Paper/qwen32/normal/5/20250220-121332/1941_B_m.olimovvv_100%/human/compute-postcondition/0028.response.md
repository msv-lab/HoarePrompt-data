The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `b`. This means that the initial state provided in the problem is overwritten by the new input values.

Since the initial state of `b` is no longer relevant after this operation, we do not retain any of the original information about `b` from the initial state. The only information we retain is that `a` is an input integer and the output is 'YES'. However, since `a` is not used in the provided code snippet, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a list of integers provided by the input; `a` is an input integer; the output is 'YES'.**
