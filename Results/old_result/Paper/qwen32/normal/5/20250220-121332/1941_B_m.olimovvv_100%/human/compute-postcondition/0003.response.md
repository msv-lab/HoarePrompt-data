To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `a`, and the range parameters `0` and `a - 2`. 

The loop will execute if the range `(0, a - 2)` is valid, meaning `a - 2` must be greater than `0`. Therefore, `a` must be greater than `2` for the loop to execute.

The variable `t` and the list `b` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input

We need to ensure `a > 2` for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
