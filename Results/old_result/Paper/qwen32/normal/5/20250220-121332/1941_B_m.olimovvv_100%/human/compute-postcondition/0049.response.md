The code snippet `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` modifies the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting the value of `b[i]` from it. Given that `b[i]` is 0, the value of `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged because subtracting 0 from any number does not change its value.

The other variables (`a`, `i`, and the output) remain unchanged as per the initial state conditions. Here is the output state:

Output State: **`b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is unchanged, `b[i + 2]` is unchanged; `a` is an input integer and must be greater than 7; the output is 'YES'; `i` is 5. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.**
