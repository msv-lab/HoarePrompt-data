The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state of the other variables (`arr`, `data`, `index`, and `t`) is not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
