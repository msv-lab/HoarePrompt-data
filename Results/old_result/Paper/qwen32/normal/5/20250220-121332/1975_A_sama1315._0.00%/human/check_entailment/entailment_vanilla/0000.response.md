Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that we need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of operations where we can split the array into two parts (a prefix and a suffix) and swap these parts. We need to check if there exists a way to perform such operations to make the array sorted.

### Key Observations

1. **Understanding the Operation:**
   - The operation allows us to take any prefix of the array and swap it with the suffix. This means we can essentially rotate the array by any number of positions.

2. **Sorted Array Condition:**
   - If the array is already sorted, then the answer is "Yes".
   - If the array can be rotated to become sorted, then the answer is also "Yes".

3. **Rotation Check:**
   - For an array to be rotatable into a sorted array, there should be at most one "drop" in the array. A "drop" is where an element is greater than the next element.
   - If there is more than one drop, the array cannot be rotated into a sorted array.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided code:

#### Function `func_1(arr)`

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'
```

- The first `if` condition checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, the function returns `'Yes'`.
- The `else` condition is incorrect because it checks if there are any drops in the array. If there are drops, it should return `'No'`, but the code returns `'Yes'` which is incorrect. This is because the presence of one or more drops does not necessarily mean the array cannot be rotated to become sorted. There should be at most one drop for the array to be potentially rotatable into a sorted array.

#### Function `func_2()`

```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

- This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Conclusion

The main issue with the provided code is the incorrect logic in `func_1`. The function does not correctly handle the case where there is exactly one drop in the array, which could still allow the array to be rotated into a sorted array.

### Correctness

Given the incorrect logic in `func_1`, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
