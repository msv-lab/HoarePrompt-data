Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with length `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**

In simple terms: The list `arr` remains unchanged, as does the list `data` and the value of `t`. The variable `index` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1.
