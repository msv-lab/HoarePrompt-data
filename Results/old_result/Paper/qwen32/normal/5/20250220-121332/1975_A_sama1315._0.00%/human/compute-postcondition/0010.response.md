The code snippet `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Given that the initial state specifies `index` is 2, and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, after the operation, `index` will be `2 + n`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index 2 to `2 + n`, where each element in `arr` is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `index` has been updated to `2 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
