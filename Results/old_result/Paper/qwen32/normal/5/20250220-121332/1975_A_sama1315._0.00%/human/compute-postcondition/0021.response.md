The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` by converting the element at the `index` position in the `data` list to an integer. 

Given the initial state, `index` is `3 + 2n`. The new value of `n` will be the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + n` to `3 + 2n`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing the values of `result` (previously appended) and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**.

In simpler terms: The value of `n` is now the integer value found at the position `3 + 2n` in the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
