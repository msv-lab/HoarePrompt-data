Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + 2n + 1` to `3 + 3n + 1`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n + 1 + n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing the values of `result` (previously appended) and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**

In simple terms, the value of `index` has been updated to `3 + 2n + 1 + n`, which simplifies to `3 + 3n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
