The code snippet provided updates the value of `arr` by mapping the elements from the slice `data[index:index + n]` to integers. Given the initial state, `index` is `2 + n + 1` and `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`. Therefore, the slice `data[index:index + n]` is effectively `data[2 + n + 1:2 + n + 1 + n]`, which is `data[3 + n:3 + 2n]`.

After executing the code, `arr` will be a list of integers derived from this slice. The other variables (`data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, `n`, `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + n` to `3 + 2n`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2 + n + 1`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 2; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**.
