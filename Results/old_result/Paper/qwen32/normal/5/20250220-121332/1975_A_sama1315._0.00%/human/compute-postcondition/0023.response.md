The provided code snippet modifies the `arr` variable. It slices the `data` list starting from `index` to `index + n` and converts each element in this slice to an integer, then assigns the resulting list to `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + n` to `3 + 2n`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is `3 + 2n + 1`.
- `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1.
- `results` is a list containing the values of `result` (previously appended) and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`.

The code modifies `arr` to be a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from `index` to `index + n`.

Therefore, the new `arr` will be a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from `3 + 2n + 1` to `3 + 2n + 1 + n`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + 2n + 1` to `3 + 3n + 1`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n + 1`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 1; `results` is a list containing the values of `result` (previously appended) and the new `result` from `func_1(arr)`; `n` is the integer value of `data[3 + 2n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**.
