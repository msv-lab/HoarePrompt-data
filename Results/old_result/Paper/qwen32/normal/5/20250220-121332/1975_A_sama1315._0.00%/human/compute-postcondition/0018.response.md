The code snippet provided is `result = func_1(arr)`. This line of code calls the function `func_1` with the argument `arr` and assigns the returned value to the variable `result`. 

Given the initial state, the variable `result` is initially the value returned by `func_1(arr)`. After executing the code, the variable `result` will be updated to the value returned by the function call `func_1(arr)`.

The other variables (`arr`, `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + n` to `3 + 2n`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 2; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**.
