The code snippet `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Given the initial state, `index` was `2 + n + 1`, which simplifies to `3 + n`. After the increment, `index` becomes `3 + n + n`, which simplifies to `3 + 2n`.

Other variables (`arr`, `data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, `result`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from slicing `data` from index `3 + n` to `3 + 2n`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `3 + 2n`; `t` is an integer value such that `t` >= 2; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`; `result` is the value returned by `func_1(arr)`**.
