You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: curr is 0 and the function does not return 'NO'.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` evaluates a list of test cases, where each test case consists of a number of containers and their respective water amounts. It checks if it's possible to redistribute the water in the containers such that each container has the same amount. The function returns 'YES' if redistribution is possible for all test cases and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that causes it to return incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the program checks if the cumulative difference (`curr`) ever becomes negative, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

The issue arises because the program only checks if the cumulative difference ever goes negative, but it doesn't account for the fact that water can be transferred from later containers to earlier ones to balance out the cumulative difference. Here is a counterexample to illustrate this:

**Counterexample:**
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO
```

In this case, the program will return "NO" because the cumulative difference becomes negative at the second step (after processing the first container):
- After processing the first container: `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (which is negative).

However, it is possible to balance the water by transferring 1 unit from the third container to the first container and 1 unit from the third container to the second container, resulting in all containers having 2 units of water.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the cumulative difference never goes negative, which it does correctly, but it should also ensure that the cumulative difference can be balanced out by the remaining containers. This means that the program should ensure that the cumulative difference can be zeroed out by the time it reaches the end of the list.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

However, the original program does not correctly handle the scenario where the cumulative difference can be balanced out by the remaining containers. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
