Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that causes it to return incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the program checks if the cumulative difference (`curr`) ever becomes negative, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

The issue arises because the program only checks if the cumulative difference ever goes negative, but it doesn't account for the fact that water can be transferred from later containers to earlier ones to balance out the cumulative difference. Here is a counterexample to illustrate this:

**Counterexample:**
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO
```

In this case, the program will return "NO" because the cumulative difference becomes negative at the second step (after processing the first container):
- After processing the first container: `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (which is negative).

However, it is possible to balance the water by transferring 1 unit from the third container to the first container and 1 unit from the third container to the second container, resulting in all containers having 2 units of water.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the cumulative difference never goes negative, which it does correctly, but it should also ensure that the cumulative difference can be balanced out by the remaining containers. This means that the program should ensure that the cumulative difference can be zeroed out by the time it reaches the end of the list.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

However, the original program does not correctly handle the scenario where the cumulative difference can be balanced out by the remaining containers. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
