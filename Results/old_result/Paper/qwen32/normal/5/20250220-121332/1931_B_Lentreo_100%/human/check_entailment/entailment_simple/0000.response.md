### Reasoning:
The provided annotated program has a logical flaw. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Parsing**: The variable `nums` is intended to represent the list of water amounts for a single test case, not a list of lists. The comment incorrectly states that `nums` is a list of lists, which it is not. Each test case is processed individually, and `nums` should simply be the list of water amounts for that test case.

2. **Incorrect Total Calculation**: The `total` is calculated correctly as the sum of the elements in `nums`. However, the comment incorrectly states that `total` is the sum of the inner lists of `nums`, which is not the case.

3. **Logic Error in the Loop**: The core logic of the program is to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from left to right. The `curr` variable is used to track the cumulative deviation from the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that we cannot pour enough water from the left containers to balance the right containers, and the function should return 'NO'. If `curr` remains non-negative throughout the loop, the function returns 'YES'.

However, the provided code has a logical flaw in the way it processes the list. The loop should start from the second element (index 1) because the first element (index 0) does not need to be checked for pouring water from a previous container since there is no container to the left of it.

4. **State Comments**: The state comments are misleading and do not accurately reflect the state of the program. For example, the comment stating that `nums` is a list of lists is incorrect. The comment about the state after the loop incorrectly assumes `curr` should be 0, which is not necessary for the function to return 'YES'. The function should return 'YES' if `curr` never goes negative during the loop.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the function to ensure it works as intended:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the logical flaw in the loop and the misleading comments. The corrected program should work as intended.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The provided program incorrectly processes the input and contains misleading comments. The logic for checking the possibility of making all containers have the same amount of water is flawed.
Correctness: **False**
