### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if we can redistribute the water in the containers such that all containers have the same amount of water, using the specified operation (pouring water from an earlier container to a later one).

The provided program follows a logical approach to solve this problem:
1. **Calculate the mean**: Since the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, the mean amount of water each container should have after redistribution is simply the total amount of water divided by the number of containers.
2. **Check feasibility**: The program iterates through the containers, keeping a running total of the difference between the current amount of water and the mean. If at any point this running total becomes negative, it means there is not enough water in the earlier containers to redistribute and meet the mean requirement for the later containers. In such a case, the program returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without the running total going negative, it returns 'YES'.

This logic is correct because:
- If the running total ever goes negative, it indicates a deficit that cannot be resolved by the allowed operations (pouring from earlier to later containers).
- If the running total never goes negative, it means that the water can be redistributed to meet the mean requirement.

The provided execution summary aligns with this reasoning, indicating that the function evaluates each test case correctly based on the described logic.

### Correctness: **True**
