Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    curr += nums[i] - mean
    if curr < 0:
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`. `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `curr` remains greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i + 1` and `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return and `curr` remains updated as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
