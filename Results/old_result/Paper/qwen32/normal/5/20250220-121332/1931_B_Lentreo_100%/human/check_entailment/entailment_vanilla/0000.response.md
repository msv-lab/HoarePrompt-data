### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. The operation allows us to pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.

The key observation here is that since the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, there exists a target amount `mean` such that each container should ideally contain `mean` units of water.

The program provided follows these steps:
1. **Input Handling**: It reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
2. **Feasibility Check**: It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns "NO". However, according to the problem statement, this check is redundant because it is guaranteed that the total amount of water is divisible by `n`.
3. **Mean Calculation**: It calculates the mean amount of water each container should contain.
4. **Balance Check**: It iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running balance `curr` which is the difference between the current cumulative water and the cumulative target water (`mean * i`). If at any point this balance becomes negative, it means there is not enough water in the previous containers to balance the current container, and it returns "NO".
5. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without the balance going negative, it returns "YES", indicating that it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

The logic behind the balance check is correct because if at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the total amount of water in the containers from the start up to the current container is less than the required amount, making it impossible to balance the water without violating the operation constraints (pouring from `i` to `j` where `i < j`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

**Correctness: True**
