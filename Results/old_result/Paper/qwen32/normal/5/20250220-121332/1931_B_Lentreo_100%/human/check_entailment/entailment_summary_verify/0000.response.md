Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment in detail.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to determine if it is possible to redistribute water in containers such that each container has the same amount of water using a specific operation (pouring water from a container with index i to a container with index j where i < j).

### Program Analysis
The provided program follows these steps:
1. Calculate the total amount of water in all containers.
2. Check if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (n). If not, return "NO" (though this check is redundant given the problem constraints).
3. Calculate the mean amount of water each container should have.
4. Iterate through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference (`curr`) between the current amount of water and the mean.
5. If at any point the cumulative difference (`curr`) becomes negative, return "NO".
6. If the loop completes without the cumulative difference becoming negative, return "YES".

### Function Summary
The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if it is possible to redistribute the water such that each container has the same amount. It does this by ensuring that the cumulative difference (`curr`) never goes negative.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of balancing the cumulative difference with water from later containers. It provides a counterexample where the program incorrectly returns "NO" for a case where redistribution is possible.

### Counterexample Analysis
The counterexample given is:
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3

Expected Output:
YES

Actual Output:
NO
```
Let's walk through the execution of the program with this input:
1. `total = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
2. `mean = total // 3 = 2`
3. Initialize `curr = 0`
4. Iterate through the containers:
   - After first container: `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (cumulative difference becomes negative)

The program correctly identifies that the cumulative difference becomes negative and returns "NO". However, this is incorrect because it is possible to redistribute the water to make each container have 2 units of water by transferring water from the third container to the first and second containers.

### Reasoning
The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program. The program only checks if the cumulative difference ever becomes negative, which is not sufficient. It should also ensure that the cumulative difference can be balanced out by the remaining containers.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of transferring water from later containers to earlier ones to balance out the cumulative difference. Therefore, the program can incorrectly return "NO" in cases where redistribution is possible.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases where redistribution is possible.

Final: **False**
