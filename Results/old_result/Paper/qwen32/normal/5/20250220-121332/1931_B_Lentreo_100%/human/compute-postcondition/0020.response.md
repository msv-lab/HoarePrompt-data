To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and the variables.

The loop iterates over each inner list in `nums` (each representing a test case), calculates the difference between each element in the inner list and the `mean`, and accumulates this difference in `curr`. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it continues until all elements in all inner lists have been processed.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final state of `curr` after all iterations will be the sum of all differences between each element in each inner list and the `mean` for that inner list. Since the sum of the elements in each inner list is divisible by `n`, the cumulative sum of these differences should be zero for each inner list. Therefore, `curr` should remain zero after all iterations if the function does not return 'NO' during any iteration.

The final output state of the loop can be described as follows:

Output State: **curr is 0 and the function does not return 'NO'.**

In natural language, this means that after processing all the test cases (all inner lists in `nums`), the accumulated difference `curr` remains zero, and the function does not encounter any situation where `curr` becomes negative, thus not returning 'NO'.
