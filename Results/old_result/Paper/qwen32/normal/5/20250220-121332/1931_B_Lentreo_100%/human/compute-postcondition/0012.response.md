The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i` (which we know is less than `n`), and `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `curr` and `total` are not part of the loop head, they should remain unchanged for the purpose of determining the next iteration state.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`. `curr` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is `i + 1`**.

To make this more precise:

State: **`nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers. The first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) is the number of containers, and the next n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of a_i in each test case is divisible by n. The total number of containers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0. `total` is the incorrect sum of the inner lists of `nums`. The `total` is divisible by `n`. `mean` is `total // n`. `curr` is `curr + nums[i] - mean`. `curr` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is 4 (assuming i was 3 at the end of the last iteration)**.

However, to generalize:
