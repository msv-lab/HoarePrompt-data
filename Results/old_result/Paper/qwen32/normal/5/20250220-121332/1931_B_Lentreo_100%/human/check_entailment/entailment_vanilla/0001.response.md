Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that you have `n` containers with water, and you want to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using a specific operation (pouring water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`).

The key points to consider:
1. The total amount of water across all containers is divisible by `n`.
2. The operation allows transferring water from a container to a container with a higher index.

### Correctness Analysis of the Program

The program provided consists of a main loop that processes each test case and a function `func_1` that determines if it's possible to equalize the water in the containers.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It calculates the total amount of water `total` in the containers.
   - It verifies if `total` is divisible by `n` (though this check is redundant as the problem guarantees that the sum is divisible by `n`).
   - It calculates the `mean` amount of water each container should have if they are to be equalized.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts:
     - It maintains a running total `curr` of the difference between the current amount of water and the `mean` for each container.
     - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to equalize the water using the specified operation.
     - If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it returns 'YES', indicating that equalization is possible.

#### Why the Program is Correct:

- The core idea of the program is based on the observation that if you can ensure that the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean never goes negative as you move from left to right, then it's possible to pour water from containers with excess water to containers with less water, always moving water from a lower index to a higher index.
- If `curr` ever goes negative, it means that there isn't enough water in the previous containers to compensate for the deficit in the current container, making it impossible to equalize the water using the given operation.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
