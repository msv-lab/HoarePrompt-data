The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This overwrites the previous values of `n` and `m` with the new values read from the input. The other variables, `t` and `iterations_left`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input; the condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` is either true or false based on the new values of `n` and `m`; `iterations_left` is the number of iterations left to execute, which is `int(input()) - 1`.**
