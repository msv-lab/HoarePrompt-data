Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.**
