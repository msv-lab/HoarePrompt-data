The given initial state describes the conditions under which the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are defined. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `m`. Instead, it directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
   - There is a condition that either `n` is less than `m` or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even. This condition, however, does not affect the `print` statement.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print('NO')` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any variables or conditions, the output will always be the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
