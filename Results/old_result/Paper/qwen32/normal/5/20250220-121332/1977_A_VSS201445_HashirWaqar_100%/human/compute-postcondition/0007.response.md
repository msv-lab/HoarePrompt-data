The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop iterates a number of times equal to the integer read from the input. Since the loop variable `_` does not influence the loop condition or any other variables in the loop head, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that the loop runs for a number of times specified by the integer read from the input, for the loop to execute one more time, the input integer must be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

However, since we cannot change the input directly, we consider the state that allows the loop to execute one more time based on the loop condition. The loop condition is determined by the input value, so we need to ensure that the input value is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even. The input integer for the loop must be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.**

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, we do not need to adjust it. The only state that needs to be considered is the input integer, which should be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

Since we can't directly change the input, we can rephrase it to indicate that the loop will execute one more time if the input integer was one more than the current state.

Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the state, we do not need to adjust it. The only state that needs to be considered is the input integer, which should be such that the loop executes one more time.
