The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `iterations_left`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of `'YES'` is explicitly known and does not depend on the values of these variables.

Here's the breakdown of the relevant parts:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers read from the input.
- The condition `n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` is either true or false.
- `iterations_left` is calculated as `int(input()) - 1`.

Since none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement, the output will simply be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
