The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state describes conditions on `n`, `m`, and `t`. After executing the given code, `n` and `m` will be updated based on the input values, but `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even. Otherwise, either `n` is less than `m` or the difference between `n` and `m` is not even.**
