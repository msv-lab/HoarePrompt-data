Postcondition: **`left` is 1, `right` is 3, `t` is 3, `a` is 3, `n` is 3, `s` is the input string, `mid` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, and `tleftZero` is 0. If the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 1, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 1, and `trightOne` is 0. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `rightZero` is 1, `rightOne` is 1, `trightZero` is 1, and `trightOne` is 0.**
