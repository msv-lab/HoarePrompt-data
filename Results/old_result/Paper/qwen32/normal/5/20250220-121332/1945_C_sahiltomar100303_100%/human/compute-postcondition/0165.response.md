The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `mid`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 4, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `leftOne` is increased by 1, and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`i` is 4, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `leftOne` is increased by 1, `tleftOne` is increased by 1**.
