To determine the output of the `print(right)` statement, we need to carefully examine the initial state provided. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

- `right` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is also explicitly given as 3.
- `right` is stated to be equal to `n`, which is consistent with the given value of `right`.

Since `right` is directly provided as 3 and there are no operations or conditions in the given code snippet that modify `right`, we can confidently state that the `print(right)` statement will output the value 3.

Output: **3**
