The code snippet increments the value of `right` by 1. Given the initial state, `right` was 7, so it will now be 8. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 8, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is 8, `s` is "11001100", `mid` is 4, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 5, `rightOne` is 3. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 4 and `trightZero` is 3. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 3 and `trightZero` is 4. In both cases, `tleftOne` is 3 and `trightOne` is 2.**
