Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 4, `t` is 3, `a` is 3, `n` is 3, `s` is the input string, `mid` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 0. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
