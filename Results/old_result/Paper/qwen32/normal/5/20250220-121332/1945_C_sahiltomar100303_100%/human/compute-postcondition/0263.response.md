Given the initial state, we know the value of `left` is explicitly stated as not being 0, and it is also explicitly given as 1. Therefore, when the `print(left)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `left`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides the value of `left` as 1.
2. The `print(left)` statement will output the value of `left`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **1**
