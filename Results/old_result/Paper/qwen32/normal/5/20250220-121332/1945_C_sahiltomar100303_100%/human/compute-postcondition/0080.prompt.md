Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 1`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` (from index `mid` to `n-1`), `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from index `mid` to `n-1`), `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` (from index `mid` to `n-1`), `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` (from index `mid` to `n-1`), `left` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 1`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `rightZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `leftOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `rightOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `tleftZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `trightZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `tleftOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `trightOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, `leftMove` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 2`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is less than `n // 2`, `rightZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`. If the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `rightZero` remains unchanged. `leftOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`. If the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', then `leftOne` is decremented by 1 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` remains unchanged. `rightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 2) // 2`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 2`, and `leftMove` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 2`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is less than `(n // 2 - 1) // 2` and is now `leftZero - 1` if `s[left - 1] == '0'`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `rightZero` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s` and is now `rightZero + 1` if `s[left - 1] == '0'`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `leftOne` is updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s` and is now `leftOne - 1` if `s[left - 1] != '0'`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `rightOne` is less than `(n - n // 2 + 3) // 2` and is now `rightOne + 1` if `s[left - 1] != '0'`; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in `s`. `left` is `n // 2 - 3`, and `leftMove` is 0.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
