Given the initial state, we can see that `left` is explicitly defined as 0. The other variables mentioned (`right`, `t`, `a`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftMove`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, and `rightOne`) are either defined with specific values or described with conditions, but they are not used in the `print` statement.

The `print(left)` statement will output the value of the variable `left`.

Output: **0**
