Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 1, `t` is 3, `a` is 3, `n` is 3, `s` is the input string, `mid` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 1, `trightOne` is -1, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftOne` is 2`**

Explanation: The value of `trightOne` is decremented by 1, so it changes from 0 to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
