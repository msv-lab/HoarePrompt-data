To determine what will be printed when the `print(right)` statement executes, we need to analyze the initial state provided and identify the value of the variable `right`.

From the initial state, we have the following information:
- `right` is 3.
- Other variables such as `left`, `t`, `a`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftMove`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne` are also mentioned, but their specific values are not required to determine the value of `right`.

The `print(right)` statement directly outputs the value of the variable `right`. Since the initial state explicitly states that `right` is 3, the output will be 3.

Output: **3**
