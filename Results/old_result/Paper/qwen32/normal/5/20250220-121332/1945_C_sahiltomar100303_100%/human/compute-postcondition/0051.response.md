The code snippet `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Therefore, the value of `rightOne` is now the previous value of `rightOne` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is a new input integer such that `n > 1`, `s` is the value of the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `i` is `mid + 2`, `rightZero` is 3 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise 0, `trightZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise 2, `rightOne` is the previous value of `rightOne` plus 1.**
