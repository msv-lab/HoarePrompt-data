Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the optimal position to place the road. Specifically, the program attempts to move the "road" position from the middle and checks if the conditions are met, but it does not ensure that the road is placed in the position that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle while satisfying the conditions.

The program initializes the road position at the middle and then tries to move it left and right, but it does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not always find the optimal position. Here are some points to consider:

1. **Initial Split**: The program starts by splitting the array at the middle and counts the number of 0s and 1s on both sides. However, this initial split may not be valid if the conditions are not met.

2. **Moving the Road**: The program then tries to move the road position left and right to find a valid position. However, the logic for moving the road does not correctly handle the conditions, and it may skip over valid positions.

3. **Final Decision**: The final decision logic to choose between the left and right positions is not correct. It does not always choose the position that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle while satisfying the conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        leftZero = 0
        leftOne = 0
        rightZero = s.count('0')
        rightOne = s.count('1')
        best_i = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if leftZero >= (i + 1) // 2 and rightOne >= (n - i) // 2:
                diff = abs((n + 1) // 2 - i)
                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and i < best_i):
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_i = i
            if i < n:
                if s[i] == '0':
                    leftZero += 1
                    rightZero -= 1
                else:
                    leftOne += 1
                    rightOne -= 1
        
        print(best_i)

func()
```

This corrected version initializes the counts of 0s and 1s on both sides and iterates through all possible positions for the road, checking if the conditions are met and keeping track of the position that minimizes the absolute difference from the middle.
