The code snippet increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `rightZero` is initially 1. Therefore, after the operation, `rightZero` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` is 3, `t` is 3, `a` is 3, `n` is 3, `s` is the input string, `mid` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `tleftZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 1, `trightOne` is 0, and the character at index `left - 1` in `s` is '0'.**
