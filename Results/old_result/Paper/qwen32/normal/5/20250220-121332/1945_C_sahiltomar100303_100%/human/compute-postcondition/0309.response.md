Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is the new input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are each incremented by 1, and `rightZero` and `trightZero` are each set to 1. If `s[i]` is not '0', then `rightOne` and `trightOne` are each set to 1. `leftOne` and `tleftOne` remain unchanged.**
