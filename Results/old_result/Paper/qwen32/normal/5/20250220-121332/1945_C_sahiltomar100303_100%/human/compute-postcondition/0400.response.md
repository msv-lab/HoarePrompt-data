To determine what will be printed by the `print(right)` statement, we need to refer to the initial state provided.

From the initial state, we have the following relevant information:
- `right` is explicitly given as 8.

Given that `right` is 8, the `print(right)` statement will simply print the value of `right`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **8**
