The code snippet `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Given the initial state, `tleftOne` is initially 3. After the increment, `tleftOne` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 5, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is 8, `s` is "11001100", `mid` is 4, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 5, `rightOne` is 3, `tleftZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 1, `tleftOne` is 4, `trightOne` is 2**.
