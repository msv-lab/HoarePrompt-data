The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `mid`, and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Given:
- The loop iterates from `mid` to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `n` is greater than 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that the loop condition `i < n` was still satisfied for `i = 3`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 to 4.

Now, we need to ensure that `mid` and `n` are consistent with the loop condition. Since `mid` is `n // 2` and `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4 to satisfy the loop condition `i < n`.

State: **`left` is 0, `right` is 3, `t` is 2, `a` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is the new input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is 4**
