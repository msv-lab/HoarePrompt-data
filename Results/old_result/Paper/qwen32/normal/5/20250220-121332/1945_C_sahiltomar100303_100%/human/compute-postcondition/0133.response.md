Postcondition: **`left` is not 0; `right` is 3; `t`, `a`, `n` is 3; `s`, `mid` is 1; `leftMove` remains unchanged; `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` depend on the specific values of `s[2]` and `s[3]`. If `right` equals `n`, the condition `left != 0` is true. If `right` does not equal `n` and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, the condition in the if part holds. Otherwise, the condition in the else part holds. If `left` is 0, `tleftZero` is compared to the threshold (n + 1) // 2, which is 2. If `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to 2, it meets or exceeds the threshold; otherwise, it is less than the threshold.**
