Given the initial state, the variable `left` is explicitly set to 0. The `print(left)` statement will output the value of `left`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state mentions that `left` is 0.
2. The `print(left)` statement directly prints the value of `left`.

Since `left` is explicitly defined as 0, there is no need to derive or describe its value based on any conditions or formulas.

Output: **0**
