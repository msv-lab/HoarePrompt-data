You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. b is an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The field is a list of N strings, each containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces. Each pair of characters can be ".." for an empty cell, "R0", ..., "R9", "B0", ..., "B9" for players, "RG" or "BG" for goals, ".Q" for the Quaffle, or ".B" for the Bludger. There is exactly one Quaffle and at least one goal for each team. The number of steps (T) is an integer where 0 <= T <= 10000. The next T lines describe the actions of the entities, where each action is a pair of characters representing the entity followed by a valid action (U, D, L, R, C <ball>, T).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple (2*x, 2*y), where (x, y) are the elements of the tuple `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, and `b`, an integer representing the number of columns (M) in the field. The function returns a tuple where each element of the tuple `b` is doubled.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a tuple (2*x, 2*y), where (x, y) are the elements of the tuple `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
