Given the initial state and the Python code snippet:

- `a` is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd.
- `b` is a tuple `(x, y)` representing the number of columns (M) in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd.
- `dx` is `x`.
- `dy` is `y`.
- The field is a list of N strings, each containing M pairs of characters separated by spaces.
- There is exactly one Quaffle and at least one goal for each team.
- The number of steps (T) is an integer where 0 <= T <= 10000.
- The next T lines describe the actions of the entities.

The code snippet provided is:
```
return x + dx, y + dy
```

From the initial state:
- `b` is a tuple `(x, y)`.
- `dx` is `x`.
- `dy` is `y`.

Thus, the return statement becomes:
```
return x + x, y + y
```
or
```
return 2*x, 2*y
```

Since `b` is `(x, y)`, the program returns a tuple where each coordinate is doubled.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple (2*x, 2*y), where (x, y) are the elements of the tuple `b`.**
