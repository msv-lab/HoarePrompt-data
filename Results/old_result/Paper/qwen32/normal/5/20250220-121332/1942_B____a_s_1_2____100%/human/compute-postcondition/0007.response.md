The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the `i`-th element of the list `p` by setting it to the value of `mex - a[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` must be at least 1
- `a` is a list of `n` integers
- `p` is a list of `-1` with length `n`
- `mex` is `n`

After executing the code, the `i`-th element of `p` changes from `-1` to `mex - a[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `mex` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is `n`**.
