The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was `0` (since the loop runs down to `-1` and stops when `i` becomes `-1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be set to the next value in the sequence, which is `n - 1`.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop should start with `i` equal to `n - 1` to ensure it runs the correct number of times.

State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `n - a[i]` and the rest equal to `-1`, `mex` is `min(mex, p[i])`, `i` is `n - 1`**
