### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to construct a permutation `p` from an array `a` based on the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by iterating over the array `a` in reverse order. It maintains a variable `mex` which is initialized to `n` (the length of the permutation). For each element in `a`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value of `MEX` for an array of length `n` (since `MEX` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array).

2. **Reverse Iteration**: The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` using the formula `mex - a[i]`. This formula is derived from the given relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, which can be rearranged to `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

3. **Updating `mex`**: After calculating `p[i]`, the program updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This step ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p` (up to the current point in the reverse iteration).

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

### Analysis:

The approach taken by the program is correct. By iterating in reverse and using the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, the program effectively constructs a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given relationship with `a`. The update of `mex` ensures that the constructed permutation is valid and contains all integers from `0` to `n-1` exactly once.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.

**Correctness: True**
