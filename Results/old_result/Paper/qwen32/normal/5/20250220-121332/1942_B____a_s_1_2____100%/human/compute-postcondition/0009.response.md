The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0` in reverse order. If `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0` because the loop is iterating in reverse from `n-1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be set to a value that is still within the range of the loop, but since `i` is `0` at the end of the last iteration, the loop will terminate after that iteration.

However, if we are to consider the state right before the loop terminates, we need to adjust `i` to the value it would have been just before the last iteration, which is `1` (assuming `n` is at least `2`). If `n` is `1`, then the loop will not execute at all, and the state will simply be the same as the end of the previous iteration.

Given that the task is to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we assume `n` is at least `2` and adjust `i` accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is `min(n, n - a[i])`, `i` is 1**
