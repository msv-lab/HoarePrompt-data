Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a permutation `p` of the list `a` such that the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `p` is maximized.**
