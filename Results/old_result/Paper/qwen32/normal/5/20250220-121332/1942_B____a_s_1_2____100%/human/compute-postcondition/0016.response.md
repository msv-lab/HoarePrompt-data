To determine the output of the `print(*p)` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and the computation involved.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an integer input by the user such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers.
4. `p` is a list where the `i`-th element is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
5. `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not yet appeared in the list `p`.

### Computation Steps:
1. **Determine `mex`:** 
   - `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the list `p`. Initially, `p` is empty, so `mex` starts at 0.
2. **Construct List `p`:**
   - For each element `a[i]` in the list `a`, compute the `i`-th element of `p` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - After each computation, update `mex` to be the smallest non-negative integer not in the updated list `p`.

### Example Walkthrough:
To illustrate, let's consider an example where `a = [3, 1, 2]`:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `p = []`
   - `mex = 0`

2. **First Iteration (i = 0):**
   - Compute `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 0 - 3 = -3`.
   - Update `p = [-3]`.
   - `mex` is now the smallest non-negative integer not in `p`, which is `0`.

3. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
   - Compute `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 0 - 1 = -1`.
   - Update `p = [-3, -1]`.
   - `mex` is now the smallest non-negative integer not in `p`, which is `0`.

4. **Third Iteration (i = 2):**
   - Compute `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 0 - 2 = -2`.
   - Update `p = [-3, -1, -2]`.
   - `mex` is now the smallest non-negative integer not in `p`, which is `0`.

### General Case:
For the given `a`, the list `p` is constructed based on the above logic. The `mex` value is recalculated after each element is added to `p`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*p)` statement will print all elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:
Based on the initial state and the computation process, the list `p` is constructed such that each element is `mex - a[i]` where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the current list `p`. The final output will be the elements of `p`.

Output: **p (where p is a list of integers constructed as mex - a[i] for each i from 0 to n-1, with mex being recalculated after each element is added to p)**
