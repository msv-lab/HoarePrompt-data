Given the initial state and the code snippet provided, we will determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `t` is `t-2`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user
- `p` is a list of length `n` with each element equal to `-1`
- `mex` is `n`

Code snippet:
```
p[i] = mex - a[i]
```

This line of code updates the `i`-th element of the list `p` to be the difference between `mex` and the `i`-th element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `n - a[i]` and the rest equal to `-1`, `mex` is `n`**

In simple terms, the `i`-th element of the list `p` is now `n - a[i]`, while all other elements of `p` remain `-1`. Other variables such as `t`, `n`, `a`, and `mex` remain unchanged.
