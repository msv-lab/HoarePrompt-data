The provided code snippet only includes the line `n = int(input())`. This line will read an integer from the user and assign it to the variable `n`, overwriting the previous value of `n` which was the length of the list `a` input by the user.

Given this, the new value of `n` will be whatever integer the user inputs. The initial state mentioned other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, and `mex`), but none of these are affected by the provided line of code. Therefore, the only change is to the variable `n`.

Output State: **`t` is `t-2`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`.**
