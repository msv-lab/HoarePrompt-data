Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is the length of the new list `a` input by the user, `a` is the new list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` with the `i`-th element equal to `mex - a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, each element in the list `p` will be calculated as the difference between the current `mex` and the corresponding element in the list `a`. The `mex` will be the smallest value found in the list `p` after all these calculations are done.
