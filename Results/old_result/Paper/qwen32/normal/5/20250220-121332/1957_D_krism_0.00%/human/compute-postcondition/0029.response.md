The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range `32`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range `32`. If `j` is less than `32`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `0`, and the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `31`. Since the loop has just started, `j` should be `0` at the start of the first iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value of `0`, making it `1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where the 0-th sublist is [0, 1] if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, otherwise [1, 0], `i` is `n`, `cur` is `prefix[n]`, `j` is 1.**
