The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 32. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing [1, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` is [x, y] such that x is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 0, and y is the count of times the `j`-th bit of `cur` was 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `cur` is `prefix[n - 2]`, `j` is 1. If the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 1, `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is 0, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**
