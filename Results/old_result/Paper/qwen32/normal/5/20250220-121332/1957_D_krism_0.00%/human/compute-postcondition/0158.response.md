Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a single test case where it reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It calculates a result based on the bitwise XOR prefix sums of the list and prints intermediate and final results. The final result printed is an integer `ans` which is computed by considering the counts of 0s and 1s in specific bit positions across the prefix sums.**
