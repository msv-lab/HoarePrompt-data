Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, with `pre[0]` being `[1, 2]` if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise `[2, 1]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[1][1]` has been incremented by 1 and the second element of `suf[1]` has been decremented by 1. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, the first element of `pre[1]` has been incremented by 1 and the first element of `suf[1]` has been decremented by 1. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists where the second element of `suf[0]` has been decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise the first element of `suf[0]` has been decremented by 1. `i` is 2, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 2, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is `prefix[2]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[2][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the first element of `pre[2]` is incremented by 1 and the first element of `suf[2]` is decremented by 1.**
