The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 32. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where the first sublist is [1, 0] and the second sublist is [1, 0], and all other sublists are [0, 0], `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, `i` is 2**
