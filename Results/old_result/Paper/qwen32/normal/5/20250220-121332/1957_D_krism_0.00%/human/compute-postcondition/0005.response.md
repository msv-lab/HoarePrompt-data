Given the code snippet `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])`, we need to understand its effect on the variables provided in the initial state.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (no change)
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 (no change)
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 (no change)
- `prefix` is a list containing a single element, `0`. After the operation `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])`, `prefix` will now have two elements: the original `0` and the new element `v ^ 0`, which simplifies to `v`.

So, the updated `prefix` list will be `[0, v]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v]**
