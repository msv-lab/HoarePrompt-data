Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each `[1, 1]` if the corresponding bit in `c` is 1, otherwise `[2, 0]`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist `suf[j]` has been decremented by 1 in either the first or second element based on the corresponding bit in `c`, `i` is 2, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 32, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[2]`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, with `pre[0]` being `[1, 2]` if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise `[2, 1]`, and other sublists unchanged based on the corresponding bit in `c`, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists where the second element of `suf[0]` has been decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise the first element of `suf[0]` has been decremented by 1, `i` is 2, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 0, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is `prefix[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, with `pre[0]` being `[1, 2]` if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise `[2, 1]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[1][1]` has been incremented by 1 and the second element of `suf[1]` has been decremented by 1. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, the first element of `pre[1]` has been incremented by 1 and the first element of `suf[1]` has been decremented by 1. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists where the second element of `suf[0]` has been decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise the first element of `suf[0]` has been decremented by 1. `i` is 2, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 1, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is `prefix[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `prefix` is a list [0, v1, v1 ^ v2, v1 ^ v2 ^ v3, ..., v1 ^ v2 ^ ... ^ vn], `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, with `pre[0]` being `[1, 2]` if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise `[2, 1]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[1][1]` has been incremented by 1 and the second element of `suf[1]` has been decremented by 1. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, the first element of `pre[1]` has been incremented by 1 and the first element of `suf[1]` has been decremented by 1. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists where the second element of `suf[0]` has been decremented by 1 if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, otherwise the first element of `suf[0]` has been decremented by 1. `i` is 2, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `j` is 2, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is `arr[1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is `prefix[2]`. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, `pre[2][1]` is incremented by 1 and `suf[2][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the first element of `pre[2]` is incremented by 1 and the first element of `suf[2]` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
