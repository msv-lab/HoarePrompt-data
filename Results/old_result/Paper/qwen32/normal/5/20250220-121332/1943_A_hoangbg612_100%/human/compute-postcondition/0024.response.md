The code snippet provided is `M[cur] += 1`, which increments the value at the index `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `M` or the value of `cur`, we can infer that `M` is a dictionary and `cur` is a key within that dictionary. 

Given the initial state, the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` are not affected by this line of code. The only change is that the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the previously processed element, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
