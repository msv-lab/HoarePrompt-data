Postcondition: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the current `num`. If `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is updated to the value of `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
