The line of code `cnt = []` reinitializes the variable `cnt` to an empty list. This means that any previous values stored in `cnt` are discarded and `cnt` is now an empty list. The other variables (`cur`, `M`, `S`, `T`, and `N`) are not affected by this line of code and retain their previous values.

Output State: **`cur` is the largest number in `N` processed without a gap greater than 1, incremented by 1 if the sum of the counts of all unique numbers in `M` equals `S`; `M` is a dictionary with counts of each unique number in `N`; `S` is the integer value from user input; `cnt` is an empty list; `T` is decremented by 1; `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order.**
