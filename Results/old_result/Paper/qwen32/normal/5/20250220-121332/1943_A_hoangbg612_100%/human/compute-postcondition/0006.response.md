The code snippet provided initializes a new dictionary `M`. This action does not affect the values of the existing variables `T`, `S`, `N`, or `cur`. 

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `cur` is -1; `M` is an empty dictionary.**
