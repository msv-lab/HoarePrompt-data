The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N` and the current value of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` took on the value of the last element in `N` that was processed. For the loop to execute again, `N` must have at least one more element that has not been processed yet.

Let's denote the last processed element as `N[j]`. For the next iteration, `num` should take on the value of the next element in the list, which is `N[j+1]`.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the previously processed element, `M` is a dictionary that reflects the state after processing the previously processed element, `cur` is updated based on the conditions provided in the loop body.**

Since `num` is the only variable in the loop head that we can adjust, we simply need to set `num` to the next element in `N`. All other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `cur`) remain as they are unless they are updated within the loop body, which we are not concerned with for this task.

State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the previously processed element.**
