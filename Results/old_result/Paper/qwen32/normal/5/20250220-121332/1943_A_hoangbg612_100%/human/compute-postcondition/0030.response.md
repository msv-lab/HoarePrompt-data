Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the next element in `N` after the current `num`, `cur` is updated to the value of `num`, and `M[cur]` is updated as follows: if `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1; otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. If `num` > `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The value of `cur` is now set to the value of `num`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for updating `M[cur]` and potentially breaking out of a loop remain the same.
