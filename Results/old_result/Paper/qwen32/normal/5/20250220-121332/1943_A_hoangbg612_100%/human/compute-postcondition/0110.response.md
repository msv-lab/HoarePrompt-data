The code sorts the list `N`. The values of `cnt`, `cur`, `T`, and `S` remain unchanged. The list `N` is now in ascending order.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, if the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is set to `cnt[1]`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged or is not set. `T` is `T-1`. `S` is an input integer. `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**
