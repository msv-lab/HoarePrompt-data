The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged unless directly affected by this operation.

Given the initial state, `cnt` is a list, and `k` is the next key in the iteration order of `M.keys()`. After appending `k` to `cnt`, `cnt` will now include `k` as its last element.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list that now includes `k` as its last element, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one unique element, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts, and `M` must be non-empty. If `M[k]` equals 1, `cnt` contains the element `k`. `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element of `N`. `k` is the next key in the iteration order of `M.keys()`**.

In simpler terms, `cnt` now includes `k` at the end, while all other variables retain their previous states.
