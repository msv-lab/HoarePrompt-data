The code snippet `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The values of `T`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged. The condition involving `num` and `cur + 1` and the subsequent actions (incrementing `cur` and breaking out of a loop) are not affected by this assignment and will be evaluated in subsequent code execution.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `cur` is now equal to `num`.**
