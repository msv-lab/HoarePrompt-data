To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the provided initial state and the described iterations.

### Loop Behavior Recap:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `cnt` is a list (though it's not used in the loop).
   - `T` is `T-1` (though it's not used in the loop).
   - `S` is an input integer (though it's not used in the loop).
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `M` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - For each `num` in `N`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`:
       - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks.
       - Otherwise, `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

### Iteration Details:
- **First Iteration**: `num` is the first element of `N`.
  - If `num` > `-1`, `cur` becomes `num` and `M[num]` is set to 1.
  - If `num` <= `-1`, `cur` remains `-1` and `M[-1]` is set to 1.
- **Second Iteration**: `num` is the second element of `N`.
  - If `num` > `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[num]` is set to 1.
  - If `num` <= `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
- **Third Iteration**: `num` is the third element of `N`.
  - If `num` > `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 and `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[num]` is set to 1.
  - If `num` <= `cur`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop processes each element of `N`. The dictionary `M` will have keys corresponding to each unique number in `N` and the values will represent the count of occurrences of each number in `N`. The variable `cur` will hold the last number processed by the loop.

### Conclusion:
The final output state will be:
- `cnt` remains a list (unchanged).
- `T` remains `T-1` (unchanged).
- `S` remains an input integer (unchanged).
- `N` remains a sorted list of integers (unchanged).
- `cur` will be the last element of `N`.
- `M` will be a dictionary with keys as the unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the last element of `N`, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts.**

In simpler terms, the final state will have `cur` as the last number in the sorted list `N`, and `M` will have the count of each unique number in `N`.
