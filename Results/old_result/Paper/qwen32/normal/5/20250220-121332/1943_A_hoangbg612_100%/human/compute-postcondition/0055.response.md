The code snippet `S = int(input())` changes the value of `S` to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged except for `T`, which is decremented by 1 as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`cur` remains the same as in the initial state, `M` remains unchanged, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from `M` that have a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1.**
