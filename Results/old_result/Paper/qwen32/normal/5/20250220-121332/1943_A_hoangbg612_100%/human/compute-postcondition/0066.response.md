Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `M` is {}, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer.**

In natural language: The value of `cur` is now set to `num`. All other variables retain their initial states: `M` remains an empty dictionary, `S` retains the integer value from user input, `cnt` retains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, and `N` remains a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order with at least one integer.
