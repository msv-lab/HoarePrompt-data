Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `cur` is 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, and the value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values.
