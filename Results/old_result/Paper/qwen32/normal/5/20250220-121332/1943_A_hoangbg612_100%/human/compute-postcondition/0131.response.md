Postcondition: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains `-1` and `M[-1]` is set to 2.**
