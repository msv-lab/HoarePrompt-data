The code snippet provided appends the variable `k` to the list `cnt`. The initial state specifies that `cnt` is an empty list, and `k` is a key in the dictionary `M` with a count of 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cur` is the largest number in `N` processed without a gap greater than 1, incremented by 1 if the sum of the counts of all unique numbers in `M` equals `S`. `M` is a dictionary with counts of each unique number in `N` and must have at least one key-value pair, and the count of the key `k` in `M` is 1. `S` is the integer value from user input. `cnt` is a list containing the value `k`. `T` is decremented by 1. `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order.**
