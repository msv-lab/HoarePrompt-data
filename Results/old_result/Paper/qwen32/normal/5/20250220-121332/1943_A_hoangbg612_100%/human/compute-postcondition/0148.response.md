Postcondition: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one unique element, `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their counts, and `M` must be non-empty. If `M[k]` equals 1, `cnt` contains the element `k`. `cur` is the last element of `N` plus 1 if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last element of `N`.**
