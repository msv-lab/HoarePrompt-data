The code `M[cur] += 1` attempts to increment the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Given that `cur` is initially -1 and `M` is an empty dictionary, this operation will result in a `KeyError` because the key `-1` does not exist in `M`. However, if we assume the intention is to initialize the key with a value of 1 if it doesn't exist, we can simulate this behavior.

Given this assumption, the key `-1` will be added to the dictionary `M` with a value of 1.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is a dictionary with `M[-1]` equal to 1, `num` is less than or equal to `cur`**.
