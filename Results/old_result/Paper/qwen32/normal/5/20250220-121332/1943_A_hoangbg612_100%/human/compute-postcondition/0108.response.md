Output State: **`cnt` is a list. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is set to `cnt[1]`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged or is not set. `T` is decremented by 1. `S` is an input integer.**

Natural language: The variable `S` is assigned the value of an input integer. The variable `T` is decremented by 1. The state of `cnt` and `cur` remains as described in the initial state, unless `cnt` has at least 2 elements, in which case `cur` is set to `cnt[1]`.
