Postcondition: **`cur` is either `num` or -1. `M` is either `{num: 1}`, `{num: 2}`, `{num: 3}`, or `{-1: 2, num: 1}`, or `{-1: 3}`. `S` is the integer value from user input. `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1. `T` is decremented by 1. `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one more integer. `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is updated to either `{num: 1}` or `{-1: 2, num: 1}`. Otherwise, `M` is updated to either `{num: 2}`, `{num: 3}`, or `{-1: 3}`.**
