Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop; `M` is a dictionary with keys as unique elements of `N` and values as their respective counts; if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1; `cnt` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of the values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` is equal to 1, `cnt` contains the key `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of the values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` is equal to 1, `cnt` contains the key `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after the last processed key.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is the last element of `N` that was processed without breaking the loop, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `S` is the sum of the values in `M`, and `cnt` is a list. If `M[k] == 1`, `cnt` includes `k` as its last element. If `M[k] != 1`, `cnt` remains unchanged. `k` is the next key in `M.keys()` after `cur`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
