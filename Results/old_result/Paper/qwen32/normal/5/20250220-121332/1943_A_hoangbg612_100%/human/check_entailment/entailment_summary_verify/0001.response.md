Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic in the context of the problem description and the function summary. We will evaluate whether the program correctly determines the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from array `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice starts first).
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Sorting the array `N`.
2. Iterating through the sorted array to find the smallest missing integer.
3. Adjusting the current MEX (`cur`) based on the frequency of elements.

### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines and prints a specific integer `cur` based on the sorted list and the given conditions.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Sorting**: Sorting the array is not necessary for finding the MEX. Sorting can be avoided, and finding the MEX can be done more efficiently using a frequency array or set.
2. **Tracking Frequencies**: The program tracks the frequency of elements in `M`, but this approach is not optimal for determining the MEX under optimal play.
3. **Logic for Determining MEX**: The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the array contains all elements from 0 to n-1, or when there are multiple elements with the same value.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the MEX under optimal play:
1. Count the frequency of each element in `a`.
2. Simulate the game by considering the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
3. Determine the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c` after the game ends.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem description:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `4`, `0 0 1 1`
  - Sorted: `0 0 1 1`
  - Optimal Play:
    - Alice picks `1`, `c = [1]`, `a = [0, 0, 1]`
    - Bob picks `0`, `c = [1]`, `a = [0, 1]`
    - Alice picks `0`, `c = [1, 0]`, `a = [1]`
    - Bob picks `1`, `c = [1, 0]`, `a = []`
  - MEX of `c = [1, 0]` is `2`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `4`, `0 1 2 3`
  - Sorted: `0 1 2 3`
  - Optimal Play:
    - Alice picks `0`, `c = [0]`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`
    - Bob picks `1`, `c = [0]`, `a = [2, 3]`
    - Alice picks `2`, `c = [0, 2]`, `a = [3]`
    - Bob picks `3`, `c = [0, 2]`, `a = []`
  - MEX of `c = [0, 2]` is `1`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `2`, `1 1`
  - Sorted: `1 1`
  - Optimal Play:
    - Alice picks `1`, `c = [1]`, `a = [1]`
    - Bob picks `1`, `c = [1]`, `a = []`
  - MEX of `c = [1]` is `0`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob and does not accurately determine the MEX. The logic and approach used in the program are flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
