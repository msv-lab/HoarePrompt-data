The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Given the initial state, `cur` can either be the value of `num` if `num` is greater than `cur`, or `-1` otherwise. 

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 1. After executing `M[cur] += 1`, the value associated with `cur` in `M` becomes 2.
2. If `num` is not greater than `cur`, `cur` remains `-1`, and `M` has `-1` as a key with a value of 1. After executing `M[cur] += 1`, the value associated with `-1` in `M` becomes 2.

The other variables (`cnt`, `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and `2` as its value, and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `cur` remains `-1`, and `M` is a dictionary with `-1` as a key and `2` as its value.**
