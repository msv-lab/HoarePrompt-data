The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N` and the current value of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` took the value of the last element in `N` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be the next element in the list `N`.

Let's denote the current value of `num` at the end of the previous iteration as `N[j]`. Then, for the next iteration, `num` should be `N[j+1]`, provided `j+1` is a valid index in `N`.

Given that `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, and assuming we have processed up to the `j`-th element, the next element to be processed should be `N[j+1]`.

State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N` after the previously processed `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and `1` as its value, and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `cur` remains `-1`, and `M` is a dictionary with `-1` as a key and `1` as its value.**

Since we don't have the exact index `j` of the last processed element, we can generally state that `num` should be the next element in `N`:
State: **`cnt` is a list, `T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N` to be processed. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and `1` as its value, and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `cur` remains `-1`, and `M` is a dictionary with `-1` as a key and `1` as its value.**
