Postcondition: **`cur` is -1 or 0, `M` is {}, `S` is the integer value from user input, `cnt` contains all keys from the original `M` that had a value of 1, `T` is decremented by 1, `N` is a list of integers from the user input sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one integer. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `cur` is set to 0. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**
