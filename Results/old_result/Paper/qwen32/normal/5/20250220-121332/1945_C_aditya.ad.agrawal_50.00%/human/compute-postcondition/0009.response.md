The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `z_l` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`; `z_r` is equal to `z`; `o_r` is equal to `o`; `z_l` is 0.**
