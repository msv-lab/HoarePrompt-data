Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_r` and `o_r`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to the average of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`, then `ans` is set to the current value of `pos`. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.**
