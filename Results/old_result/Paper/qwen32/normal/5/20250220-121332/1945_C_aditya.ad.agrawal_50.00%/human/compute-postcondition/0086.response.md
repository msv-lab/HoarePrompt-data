Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user and contains at least one digit; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and has at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `pos` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, then `z_l` is increased by 1 and `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.**
