The code snippet provided increments the value of the variable `pos` by 1. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, or `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `pos` is incremented by 1.**
