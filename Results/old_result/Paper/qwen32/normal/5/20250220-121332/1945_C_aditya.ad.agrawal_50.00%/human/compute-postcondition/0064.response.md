The code snippet `b_d = dist` assigns the value of `dist` to the variable `b_d`. Given the initial state, `dist` is calculated as `abs(n / 2)`. Therefore, `b_d` will take the same value as `dist`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string`; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o_r` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_l` is 0; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 0; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`**.
