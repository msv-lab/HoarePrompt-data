Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user and must contain at least one digit; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_r` is the count of the digit 0 in `arr`; `o_r` is the count of the digit 1 in `arr`; `z_l` is 1; `o_l` is 0; `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`; `ans` is 0; `pos` is 1; `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is 30001`; `i` is 0**.

The value of `z_l` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
