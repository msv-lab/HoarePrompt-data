Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer; `n` is an input integer; `input_string` is the input provided by the user; `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element; `z` is the count of the digit `0` in `arr`; `o` is the count of the digit `1` in `arr`. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` is `z - 1`, `o_r` is `o`, `z_l` is 1, and `o_l` is 0. If `i` is not 0, then `z_r` is `z`, `o_r` is `o - 1`, `z_l` is 0, and `o_l` is 1. In both cases, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `1`, and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)` if `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, otherwise `b_d` is `30001`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is set to `pos` and `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `b_d` remain unchanged.**
