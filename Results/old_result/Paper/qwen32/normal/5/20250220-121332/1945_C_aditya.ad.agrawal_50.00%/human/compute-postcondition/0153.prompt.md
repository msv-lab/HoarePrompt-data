Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), representing the number of houses. This is followed by a string `a` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer decreased by 1; n is an input integer; input_string is the input provided by the user; arr is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from input_string; z is the count of the digit 0 in arr; o is the count of the digit 1 in arr; z_r is 0; o_r is 0; z_l is the count of the digit 0 in arr; o_l is the count of the digit 1 in arr; dist is abs(n / 2); ans is the position where the condition is met for the last time; pos is the length of arr; b_d is the minimum distance from n / 2 where the condition was met.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After all iterations, `pos` will be equal to the length of `arr` (i.e., `n`). `z_l` will be equal to the number of 0s in `arr`. `o_l` will be equal to the number of 1s in `arr`. `z_r` will be 0. `o_r` will be 0. `ans` will be the position where the condition was last met, indicating the position closest to the middle of the array that satisfies the balance condition. `b_d` will be the minimum distance from the middle that satisfied the condition. `t` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `pos` is n, `z_l` is z, `o_l` is o, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is position where conditions were last met, `b_d` is minimum value of abs(n / 2 - pos) that satisfied conditions, `t` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
