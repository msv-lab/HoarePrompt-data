The code snippet assigns the value of `pos` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are modified in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `i`, `pos`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `o_l`, and `o_r` remain unchanged except for the introduction of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is the input provided by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a digit from `input_string` and must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 0, `z_l` is incremented by 1 and `z_r` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is incremented by 1 and `o_r` is decremented by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`.**
