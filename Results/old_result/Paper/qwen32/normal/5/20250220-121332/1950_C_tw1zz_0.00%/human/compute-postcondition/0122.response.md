Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. If `h` equals '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is the string representation of `h` converted to a 12-hour format with leading zeros removed if necessary, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is between '02' and '12' inclusive, or 'PM' if `h` is greater than '12'.**
