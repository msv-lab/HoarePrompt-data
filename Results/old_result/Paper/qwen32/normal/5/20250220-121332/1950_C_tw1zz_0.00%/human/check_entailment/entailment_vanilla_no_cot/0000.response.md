Correctness: **False**

The program provided contains a logical error in the handling of the '00' hour, which should be converted to '12 AM' in 12-hour format, but the code incorrectly converts it to '12 PM'. Here is the problematic part of the code:

```python
elif h == '00':
    h1 = '12'
    time = 'PM'
```

This should be corrected to:

```python
elif h == '00':
    h1 = '12'
    time = 'AM'
```

Additionally, the code could be significantly simplified by using arithmetic operations to convert the hours and determine the period (AM/PM) rather than using multiple `if-elif` statements. Here is a more concise and correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = input().split(':')
        h = int(h)
        if h == 0:
            h12 = 12
            period = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            h12 = h
            period = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            h12 = 12
            period = 'PM'
        else:
            h12 = h - 12
            period = 'PM'
        
        print(f"{h12:02}:{m} {period}")

func()
```

This implementation correctly handles all edge cases and simplifies the conversion logic.
