Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, the input is a string s of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where "hh" is a two-digit string representing the hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23) and "mm" is a two-digit string representing the minutes (00 to 59).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))
    h1, m1 = '', m
    time = ''
    if h == '01':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '02':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '03':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '04':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '05':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '06':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '07':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '08':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '09':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '10':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '11':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '12':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'AM'
    elif h == '13':
        h1 = '01'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '14':
        h1 = '02'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '15':
        h1 = '03'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '16':
        h1 = '04'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '17':
        h1 = '05'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '18':
        h1 = '06'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '19':
        h1 = '07'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '20':
        h1 = '08'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '21':
        h1 = '09'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '22':
        h1 = '10'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '23':
        h1 = '11'
        time = 'PM'
    elif h == '00':
        h1 = '12'
        time = 'PM'
    print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. If `h` equals '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is the string representation of `h` converted to a 12-hour format with leading zeros removed if necessary, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is between '02' and '12' inclusive, or 'PM' if `h` is greater than '12'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h`: if `h` is '02', then `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '03', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '04', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '05', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '06', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '07', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '08', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '09', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '10', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '11', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'; if `h` is '13', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '14', then `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '15', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '16', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '17', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '18', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '19', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '20', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'; if `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` does not match any of the specified values, `h1` and `time` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` is '02', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '04', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '05', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '06', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '07', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '08', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '09', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '10', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '11', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '13', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '14', `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '15', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '16', `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '17', `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '18', `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '19', `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '20', `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '21', `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '22', `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '23', `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. For all other values of `h`, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
