Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, and `h` is not equal to any of '01', '02', '03'. If `h` equals '04', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` equals '05', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '06', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '07', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '08', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '09', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '10', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '11', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` equals '12', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than '12', `h1` is the string representation of `h` converted to a 12-hour format with leading zeros removed if necessary, and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` and `time` remain unchanged.**
