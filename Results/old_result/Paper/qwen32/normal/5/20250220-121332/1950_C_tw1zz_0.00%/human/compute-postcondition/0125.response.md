The provided code snippet reads a string input in the format "HH:MM" and splits it into two parts, `h` (hour) and `m` (minute). The `map(str, input().split(':'))` function splits the input string at the colon and converts the resulting parts into strings.

Given the initial state, `h` and `m` are already defined as parts of the string representation of `t` in "HH:MM" format. However, the code snippet will overwrite the existing `h` and `m` with the new values provided by the input.

Since the input is not specified, we will assume that the input is in the correct "HH:MM" format, and `h` and `m` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the string representation of the hour part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m` is the string representation of the minute part of the input in "HH:MM" format; `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format; If `h` equals '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is the string representation of `h` converted to a 12-hour format with leading zeros removed if necessary, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is between '02' and '12' inclusive, or 'PM' if `h` is greater than '12'.**
