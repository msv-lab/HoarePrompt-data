Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format and `h` equals '19', `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `h1` is '07', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `time` is an empty string, `h` is not equal to '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', or '18'

The code snippet assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format and `h` equals '19', `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `h1` is '07', `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `time` is 'PM'**
