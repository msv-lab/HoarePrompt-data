Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `h` is not equal to '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', and `h` is not equal to '23'. If `h` is equal to '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, the values of `h1` and `time` remain unchanged.**
