### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to convert a given time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with an AM/PM designation. The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads a time string in the format "hh:mm", splits it into hours and minutes, and then uses a series of `if-elif` statements to determine the equivalent 12-hour format and whether it is AM or PM.

However, there is a critical error in the implementation. The program incorrectly handles the conversion of "00:00" to "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM". According to the problem description, "00:00" should be converted to "12:00 AM", and "12:00" should be converted to "12:00 PM". The program currently outputs "12:00 PM" for "00:00", which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
