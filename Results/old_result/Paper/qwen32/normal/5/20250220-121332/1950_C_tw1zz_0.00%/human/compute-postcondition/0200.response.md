To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and how the variables `h1`, `m`, and `time` are derived from the input `t` in "HH:MM" format.

1. **Determine `h` and `m` from `t`:**
   - `t` is an integer representing the total number of minutes since midnight, ranging from 1 to 1440.
   - `h` is the hour part of the time in "HH:MM" format, which can be derived using integer division of `t` by 60.
   - `m` is the minute part of the time in "HH:MM" format, which can be derived using the modulus of `t` by 60.
   - `h` and `m` need to be formatted as two-digit strings, so leading zeros are added if necessary.

2. **Determine `h1` and `time`:**
   - `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is between 1 and 11, `h1` is the same as `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is 12, `h1` is 12 and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is between 13 and 23, `h1` is `h - 12` and `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is 0 (which corresponds to 1440 minutes or 24:00, but since `t` ranges from 1 to 1440, `h` will never be 0), `h1` is 12 and `time` is 'PM'.

3. **Construct the output string:**
   - The output string is constructed using `h1`, `m`, and `time` with the format `h1:m time`.

Given the above logic, let's derive the output step-by-step:

- Calculate `h` and `m` from `t`:
  - `h = t // 60`
  - `m = t % 60`
  - Format `h` and `m` as two-digit strings.

- Determine `h1` and `time` based on the value of `h`:
  - If `1 <= h <= 11`, `h1 = h` and `time = 'AM'`.
  - If `h == 12`, `h1 = 12` and `time = 'PM'`.
  - If `13 <= h <= 23`, `h1 = h - 12` and `time = 'PM'`.

- Construct the output string:
  - The output string is `h1:m time`.

Since the exact value of `t` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of `h` and `m`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the time in the 12-hour format with AM/PM.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the hour part in 12-hour format, m is the minute part, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM')**
