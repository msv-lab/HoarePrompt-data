Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440, `h` is the string representation of the hour part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format, `m1` is the string representation of the minute part of `t` in "HH:MM" format. If `h` equals '18', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '19', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '20', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '21', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` and `time` remain unchanged.**
