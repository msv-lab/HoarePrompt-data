To determine the final output state of the loop after all iterations, let's break down the loop and the given information:

The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a` and updates a dictionary `cnt` to keep track of how many times each unique stick length appears in `a`. The variable `ans` is not modified in the loop body and thus remains 0.

Given:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `n` is the number of sticks.
- `a` is a list of stick lengths.
- `ans` is initialized to 0.
- `cnt` is an empty dictionary.

The loop:
```python
for x in a:
    cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
```

**Output State after the loop executes all the iterations:**

- `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases and is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it represents the number of sticks and is not affected by the loop.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is the list of stick lengths and is not modified in the loop.
- `ans` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- `cnt` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in `a`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of sticks, `a` is the list of stick lengths, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary with each unique stick length as keys and their counts as values.**
