Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. For each test case, it calculates how many groups of three sticks can be formed from each unique stick length and sums these values. The result for each test case is printed, representing the total number of groups of three sticks that can be formed.**
