To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the value of `ans` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `n` is the number of sticks.
- `a` is the list of stick lengths.
- `cnt` is a dictionary where each unique stick length is a key, and its count in the list `a` is the value.
- `ans` is the sum of `x // 3` for all `x` in `cnt`, where `x` is a count of a stick length.

### Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Dictionary `cnt`**: This dictionary will have keys as unique stick lengths and values as the number of times each length appears in the list `a`.
2. **Sum Calculation**: For each unique stick length count `x` in `cnt`, `x // 3` is computed and summed up to get `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `a = [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.
- `cnt` will be `{3: 3, 4: 4}`.
- For `x = 3` (count of stick length 3), `x // 3 = 1`.
- For `x = 4` (count of stick length 4), `x // 3 = 1`.
- Therefore, `ans = 1 + 1 = 2`.

### General Case:
Without the specific values of `a`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the sum of integer divisions of each unique stick length count by 3.

### Output Description:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`, which is the sum of `x // 3` for all `x` in `cnt`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of x // 3 for all x in cnt, with x being the counts of unique stick lengths in the list a)**
