### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a detailed breakdown of the program and correctly identifies the checks performed by the code. Let's verify each step against the problem description:

1. **Condition 1:** The problem assumes valid inputs, and the code does not explicitly check for invalid characters. Given the assumption of valid inputs, this condition is implicitly satisfied.

2. **Condition 2:** The program iterates over the password and checks that no digit comes after a letter. This is done using the following loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(password) - 1):
       if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
           return 'NO'
   ```
   This loop ensures that if a letter is followed by a digit, the password is deemed invalid.

3. **Condition 3:** The program checks if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list to its sorted version:
   ```python
   if digits != sorted(digits):
       return 'NO'
   ```
   If the `digits` list is not sorted, the password is deemed invalid.

4. **Condition 4:** Similarly, the program checks if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order:
   ```python
   if letters != sorted(letters):
       return 'NO'
   ```
   If the `letters` list is not sorted, the password is deemed invalid.

The annotated code and the original assessment both correctly describe the program's behavior and reasoning. The annotations confirm that the program correctly checks all the conditions specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions.

Final: **True**
