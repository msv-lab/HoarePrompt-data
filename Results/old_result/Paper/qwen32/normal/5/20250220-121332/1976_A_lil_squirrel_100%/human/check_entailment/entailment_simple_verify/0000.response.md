### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Letters and Digits Only**: The password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Ordering Constraints**:
   - Letters should be in non-decreasing order.
   - Digits should be in non-decreasing order.
   - No digit should come after a letter.

#### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. **Separate Letters and Digits**: It iterates through the password and separates letters and digits into two separate lists.
2. **Check Sorted Order**:
   - It checks if the list of letters is sorted.
   - It checks if the list of digits is sorted.
3. **Check Order of Letters and Digits**:
   - It iterates through the password and checks if any letter is followed by a digit. If so, it returns "NO".
4. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, it returns "YES".

#### Annotations:
The annotations describe the state of the program at key points, which align with the logical flow of the program:
- The lists `letters` and `digits` are correctly populated.
- The checks for sorted order and the order of letters and digits are correctly implemented.

#### Testing Against Edge Cases:
The original assessment includes several edge cases, and the program correctly handles them:
- **Only Letters**: `abc` → `YES`
- **Only Digits**: `123` → `YES`
- **Unsorted Letters**: `cba` → `NO`
- **Unsorted Digits**: `321` → `NO`
- **Mixed Sorted**: `abc12` → `YES`
- **Mixed Unsorted Digits**: `abc32` → `NO`
- **Mixed Letters Followed by Digits**: `12abc` → `NO`
- **Mixed Digits Followed by Letters**: `abc123` → `YES` and `abc321` → `NO`

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. The annotations support the correctness of the program's logic, and the edge cases tested in the original assessment show that the program behaves as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
