Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the next character in the `password` string, `letters` is a list that now includes `ch` as its last element.**

In simple terms: The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The `password` string and the `ch` character remain as they were. The `letters` list now has the character `ch` appended to it.
