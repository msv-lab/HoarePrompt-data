Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed for all characters in the `password` string, the `letters` list will contain all the lowercase letters from the `password`, and the `digits` list will contain all the digits from the `password`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
