The code snippet `digits.append(ch)` appends the character `ch` to the list `digits`. Given the initial state, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `password` remains unchanged, and `ch` is the next character in the `password` string. The list `digits` will now include `ch` as its last element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the next character in the `password` string, `digits` is a list that includes `ch` as its last element.**
