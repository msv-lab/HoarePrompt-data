You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if a given password meets specific criteria. It returns 'NO' if the password contains unsorted letters, unsorted digits, or if a lowercase Latin letter is immediately followed by a digit. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the problem.

### Problem Conditions Recap:
1. The password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the length of the password `n` is read.
   - The password string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.

2. **Function `func_1(n, password)`:**
   - Two lists, `letters` and `digits`, are initialized to store letters and digits from the password, respectively.
   - The program iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it's appended to the `digits` list.
     - Otherwise, it's appended to the `letters` list.
   - The program then checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Next, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - After that, the program iterates over the password string to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks pass, the program returns 'YES'.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Condition 1:** The program does not explicitly check for invalid characters (non-lowercase letters or non-digits). However, the problem statement assumes valid inputs, so we can assume that the input will only contain lowercase letters and digits.
- **Condition 2:** The program correctly checks that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking each character against the next one.
- **Condition 3:** The program correctly checks if the digits are sorted by comparing the `digits` list to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** The program correctly checks if the letters are sorted by comparing the `letters` list to its sorted version.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
