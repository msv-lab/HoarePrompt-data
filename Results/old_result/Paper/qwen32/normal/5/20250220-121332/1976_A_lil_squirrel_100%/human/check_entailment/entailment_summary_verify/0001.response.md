Let's carefully re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary to ensure that the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Conditions Recap:
1. The password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit should come after a letter.
3. All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the length of the password `n` is read.
   - The password string is read and stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace.

2. **Function `func_1(n, password)`:**
   - Two lists, `letters` and `digits`, are initialized to store letters and digits from the password, respectively.
   - The program iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it's appended to the `digits` list.
     - Otherwise, it's appended to the `letters` list.
   - The program then checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Next, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - After that, the program iterates over the password string to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks pass, the program returns 'YES'.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Condition 1:** The program does not explicitly check for invalid characters (non-lowercase letters or non-digits). However, the problem statement assumes valid inputs, so we can assume that the input will only contain lowercase letters and digits.
- **Condition 2:** The program correctly checks that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking each character against the next one.
- **Condition 3:** The program correctly checks if the digits are sorted by comparing the `digits` list to its sorted version.
- **Condition 4:** The program correctly checks if the letters are sorted by comparing the `letters` list to its sorted version.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Mixed Content Handling:** The program separates letters and digits into two lists and checks their respective orders independently. This is correct because the problem specifies that the letters and digits can be in different sections of the password, but digits should not appear after any letter.
- **Edge Cases:** 
  - Passwords consisting only of letters or only of digits are correctly handled.
  - The program does not need to check for the presence of both letters and digits; it only needs to ensure the order and separation rules.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong based on the given conditions. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
