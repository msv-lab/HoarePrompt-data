The value of `k` is decremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k-1` are integers; `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `x` is `a[f+1]`. If `a[k]` is greater than `x`, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part.**
