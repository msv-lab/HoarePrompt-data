Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, let's break down the information and determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (this variable is not directly involved in the print statement).
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input.
- `f` is an integer obtained from the input minus 1.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input minus 2.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the integer at index `f` of the sorted list `a`.
- The current value of `a[k]` is greater than `x`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and prints the string `'NO'`. The value of `'NO'` is explicitly given and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, or `x`.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
