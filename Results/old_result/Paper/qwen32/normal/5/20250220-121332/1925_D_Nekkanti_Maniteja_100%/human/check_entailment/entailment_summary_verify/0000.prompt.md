You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with `m` pairs of integers `(a_i, b_i)` and associated values `f_i`. For each test case, it computes and prints a specific value `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is derived from the inputs provided.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Combinatorial Probability**: The code uses `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` to calculate the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs. This is correct for finding the probability of selecting any specific pair in one excursion. However, the subsequent calculations are incorrect.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The loop `for i in range(k):` attempts to calculate the sum of friendship values, but the formula used inside the loop is incorrect. The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should consider the probability of selecting each friend pair and the incremental increase in their friendship values.

3. **Friendship Value Update**: The code sums up the initial friendship values (`a`) and then incorrectly tries to add the incremental values using a loop. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the friendship values for each pair and then summing them up.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the correct approach:

- For each pair of friends `(a_i, b_i)` with initial friendship value `f_i`, the expected value of their contribution to the total sum over `k` excursions is `f_i * (1 + 2 + ... + k) / C + (1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) / C + ... + 1 / C`, where `C` is the total number of possible pairs.
- The expected value for a non-friend pair is `0`.
- The total expected value is the sum of the expected values for all pairs.

The provided code does not correctly implement this logic, leading to incorrect results.

Here's a potential counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
12
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- There are 3 children and 2 pairs of friends: (1, 2) with initial friendship value 1, and (2, 3) with initial friendship value 2.
- The total number of possible pairs is `3 * 2 / 2 = 3`.
- The expected value for pair (1, 2) is `(1 * (1 + 2 + 3) + 1 * (1 + 2) + 1 * 1) / 3 = 10 / 3`.
- The expected value for pair (2, 3) is `(2 * (1 + 2 + 3) + 2 * (1 + 2) + 2 * 1) / 3 = 20 / 3`.
- The total expected value is `(10 / 3) + (20 / 3) = 30 / 3 = 10`.
- The final result is `10 * (3^(-1) mod (10^9 + 7)) = 10 * 333333338 = 3333333380 mod (10^9 + 7) = 12`.

The provided code will not produce this correct output, confirming that it is incorrect.
