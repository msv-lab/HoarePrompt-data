The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial state includes the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, and `i`, but these are not modified by the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is in the values of `u`, `v`, and `f`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `2 * f`, `i` is `k + 3`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.**
