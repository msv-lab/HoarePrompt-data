Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. For each of the m lines in a test case, a_i and b_i are integers such that a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and f_i is an integer such that 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. All pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct within a test case.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop iterations, `i` is `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c * ((c * m * k * (k-1) // 2) % M + k * a % M) % M`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input over `m` iterations, `i` is `k + m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t remains the same as the initial value, n remains the same as the initial value, m remains the same as the initial value, k remains the same as the initial value, M remains the same as the initial value, c remains the same as the initial value, s is \( k \cdot c \cdot a + \frac{k \cdot (k-1) \cdot c^2 \cdot m}{2} \), a is the sum of all f values read from the input, i remains \( k + m + 1 \).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
