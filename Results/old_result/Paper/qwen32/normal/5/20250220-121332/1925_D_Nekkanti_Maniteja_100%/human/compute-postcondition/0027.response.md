The given code snippet updates the value of the variable `c` using the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `s`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input with `k` must be greater than 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the loop iterations, `i` is `k + 1`.**
