The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is not initialized or used in this snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with the unchanged value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
