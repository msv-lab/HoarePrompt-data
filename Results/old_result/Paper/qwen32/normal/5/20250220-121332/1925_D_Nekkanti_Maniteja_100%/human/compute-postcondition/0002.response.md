The code snippet provided assigns a specific value to the variable `M`, which is `10 ** 9 + 7`. The initial state includes `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` as integers read from the input, and these values remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new value of `M` while keeping the other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007.**
