The value of `a` is incremented by the value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is `a + f`; `m` must be greater than 0; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input.**
