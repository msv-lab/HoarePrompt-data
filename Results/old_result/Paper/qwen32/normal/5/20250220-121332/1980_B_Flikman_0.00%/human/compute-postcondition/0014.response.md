Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element, `favorite_value` is the integer at index `f - 1` in list `a`. If `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is set to 3. Otherwise, `same_value_count` is set to 2. `value` is the next element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The `same_value_count` variable is incremented by 1. If `same_value_count` was initially 2 (when `value` was equal to `favorite_value`), it becomes 3. If `same_value_count` was initially 1 (when `value` was not equal to `favorite_value`), it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
