Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `t` is `t - 3`, `s` is a string, and `leftMove` is 0. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then `right` is not equal to `n`, and if `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is -1; otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0 and `trightOne` is 1. If `right` is equal to `n`, then `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than 1.**
