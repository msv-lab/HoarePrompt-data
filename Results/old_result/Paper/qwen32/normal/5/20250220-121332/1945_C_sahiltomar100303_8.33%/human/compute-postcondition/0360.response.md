The value of `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Initially, `trightZero` is 0, so after decrementing, `trightZero` becomes -1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 1, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is a string, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is -1.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 1, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is a string, `leftMove` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is -1**.
