The code snippet provided increments the `rightZero` variable by 1. None of the other variables in the initial state are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `mid` is less than `n`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1.**
