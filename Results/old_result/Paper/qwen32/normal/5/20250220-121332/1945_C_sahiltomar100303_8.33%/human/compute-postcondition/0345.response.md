The code snippet `trightZero -= 1` decrements the value of `trightZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `trightZero` is `zero_count`. After the operation, `trightZero` becomes `zero_count - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 1, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is `zero_count - 1`, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, and `s[right]` is '0'. Additionally, if `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is -1 and `rightZero` is `zero_count + 1`; otherwise, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is `zero_count`, `leftOne` is `count_one - 1`, and `rightOne` is 1.**
