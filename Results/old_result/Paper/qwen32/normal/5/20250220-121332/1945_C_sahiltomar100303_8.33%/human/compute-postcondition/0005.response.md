The code snippet provided initializes the variable `leftZero` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `mid` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value provided by the user input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0.**
