Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string, `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is -2 and `leftOne` is `count_one - 1`, and `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is -1 and `leftOne` is `count_one - 2`, and `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `left` has been decremented by 1, making it 0. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
