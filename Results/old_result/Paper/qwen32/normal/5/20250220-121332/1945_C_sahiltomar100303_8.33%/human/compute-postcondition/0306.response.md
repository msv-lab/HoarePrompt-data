Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `leftZero` is `count_zero`, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is `count_one`, `rightOne` is `1 if s[i] is not '0', otherwise 0 + 1`, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is `s`, `tleftZero` is `count_zero + 1` if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `count_zero`, `trightZero` is 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is `1 if s[i] is not '0', otherwise 0 + 2`, `i` is `mid + 1`.**

The value of `trightOne` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
