Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `leftZero` is increased by 1, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `tleftOne` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the value of `leftZero` and `tleftZero` has increased by 1, while `leftOne` and `tleftOne` remain the same. The values of `n`, `mid`, and `i` remain unchanged.
