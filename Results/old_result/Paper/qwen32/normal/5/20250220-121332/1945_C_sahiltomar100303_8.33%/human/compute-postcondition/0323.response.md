The code snippet `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `left` is 1
- `mid` is 1
- `n` is 2
- `leftZero` is 0
- `rightZero` is `zero_count`
- `leftOne` is `count_one - 1`
- `rightOne` is 0
- `right` is 10
- `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`
- `s` is `s`
- `tleftZero` is `count_zero`
- `trightZero` is `zero_count`
- `tleftOne` is `count_one`
- `trightOne` is `one_count`
- `leftMove` is 0
- `s[left - 1]` is not '0'

After the code executes, `rightOne` becomes `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is `zero_count`, `leftOne` is `count_one - 1`, `rightOne` is 1, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is `s`, `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `trightZero` is `zero_count`, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is `one_count`, `leftMove` is 0, and `s[left - 1]` is not '0'**.
