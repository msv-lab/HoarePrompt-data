The code snippet provided is `leftZero -= 1`. However, `leftZero` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can infer that `leftZero` must have been defined somewhere prior to this code snippet, and its value is being decremented by 1 in this line. Since the initial value of `leftZero` is not provided, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation, but we know it will be 1 less than its previous value.

Given the initial state provided, the only variable that is affected by the code snippet is `leftZero`, and all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`left` is 3, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `rightOne` is less than 3, `s[2]` is '0', `leftZero` is decreased by 1.**
