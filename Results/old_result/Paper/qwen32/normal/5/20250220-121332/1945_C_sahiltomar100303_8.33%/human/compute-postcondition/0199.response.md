The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. However, `leftOne` is not defined in the initial state, so we will assume it was 0 or any other initial value, and after the operation, it becomes `leftOne - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`left` is 4, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `leftZero` is 2, `rightOne` must be less than 3, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`**.

In simpler terms, `leftOne` is reduced by 1, and all other variables retain their initial values.
