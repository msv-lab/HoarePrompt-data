The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise it is not defined. Since the code increments `tleftZero`, if it was initially 1, it will now be 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 3 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 4, `leftOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is less than 3 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` is less than 2, `right` is 7, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is not defined**
