The code snippet provided increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Therefore, the value of `rightOne` will be increased by 1 from its previous state. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` must be at least `mid + 2`, `leftZero` is `count_zero`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` is `count_one`, `rightOne` is incremented by 1, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is `s`, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` remains unchanged, `trightZero` is incremented by 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` remains unchanged, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is incremented by 2 if `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` remains unchanged, `i` is `mid + 2`**.
