The code snippet `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Given the initial state, `rightZero` is `zero_count`. After the increment, `rightZero` becomes `zero_count + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 1, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `leftZero` is -1, `rightZero` is `zero_count + 1`, `leftOne` is `count_one`, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is 10, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string such that `s[left - 1]` is '0', `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `trightZero` is `zero_count`, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is `one_count`, `leftMove` is 0**.
