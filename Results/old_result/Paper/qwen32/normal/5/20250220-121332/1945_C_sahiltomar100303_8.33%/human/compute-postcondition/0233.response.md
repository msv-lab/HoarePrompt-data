Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 3 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 4, `leftOne` is 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is less than 3 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` is less than 2, `right` is 7, `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is not defined. If `s[right]` is not '0', `tleftOne` is 1 and `trightOne` is less than 2 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `trightOne` is less than 1.**
