The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Given that `rightOne` is initially less than 3, after the increment, `rightOne` will be a value that is still less than 3 but one unit larger than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 2, `mid` is 5, `n` is 10, `rightOne` is less than 3 but incremented by 1, `s[2]` is '0'**.
