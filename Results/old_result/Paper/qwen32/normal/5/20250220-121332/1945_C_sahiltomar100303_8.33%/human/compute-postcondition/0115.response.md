Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `tleftZero` is at least `(final_right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is at least `(n - final_right + 1) // 2`, `right` is `final_right`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, `right` is equal to `n`, and if `rightOne` is at least `(n + 1) // 2`, the conditions specified in the if part hold. If `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, the conditions specified in the else part hold. Other variables remain unchanged.**
