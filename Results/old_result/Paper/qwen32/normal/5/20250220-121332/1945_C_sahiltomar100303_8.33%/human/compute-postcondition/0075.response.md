Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is 1, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is -2 (or -3 if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0'), `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` + 2 (or +3 if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0'), `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` - 1 (or -2 if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0'), `rightOne` is 1 (or 2 if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0'), `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged, `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`**

The value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1, so if it was initially the count of '0's in the second half of `s` + 1 (or +2 if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0'), it is now the count of '0's in the second half of `s` + 2 (or +3 if the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is '0'). All other variables remain unchanged.
