Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 2, `s` is the value provided by the user input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `i` is 1, `leftZero` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0.**

The value of `leftOne` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
