Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `left` is not 0
- `mid` is 5
- `n` is 10
- `leftZero` is 0
- `rightZero` is 0
- `leftOne` is 5
- `rightOne` is 1
- `right` is not equal to 10
- The absolute difference between \((n + 1) // 2\) and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between \((n + 1) // 2\) and `right`

### Calculation of \((n + 1) // 2\):
- \(n + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11\)
- \((n + 1) // 2 = 11 // 2 = 5\)

### Conditions:
- The absolute difference between 5 and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between 5 and `right`.

### Given Information:
- `mid` is 5, which is also the value of \((n + 1) // 2\).
- The condition implies that `left` is closer to 5 than `right` or equally close.

### Determining `left`:
- Since `left` is not 0 and the condition \(\left|5 - \text{left}\right| \leq \left|5 - \text{right}\right|\) holds, `left` must be a value that satisfies this condition.
- However, the exact value of `left` is not specified other than it not being 0. But given that `mid` (which is 5) is the midpoint and `left` is closer to it, the most straightforward interpretation is that `left` is 5 (since `mid` is 5 and `left` is not 0).

### Conclusion:
Given the conditions and the lack of further constraints on `left` other than it not being 0 and the provided condition, the most precise value that `left` can take, based on the given information, is 5.

### Output:
Output: **5**
