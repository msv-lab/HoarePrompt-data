Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 2, `t` is `t - 1`, `s` is a string, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is -1. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0 and `trightOne` is 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `right` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
