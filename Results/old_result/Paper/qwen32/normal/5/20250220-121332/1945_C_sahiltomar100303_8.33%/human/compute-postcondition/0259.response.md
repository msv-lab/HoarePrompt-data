Postcondition: **left is not 0, mid is 5, n is 10, leftZero is 0, rightZero is 0, leftOne is 5, rightOne is 1. If `right` is equal to `n`, then `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to 6, otherwise `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `right`, or the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `right`.**
