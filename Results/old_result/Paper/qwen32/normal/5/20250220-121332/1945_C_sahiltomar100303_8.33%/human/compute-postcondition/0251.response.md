The initial state provides us with several variable assignments and conditions. However, the `print(left)` statement is only concerned with the value of the `left` variable. According to the initial state, `left` is explicitly given as not 0, but its specific value is not provided. Since the exact value of `left` is not specified, we can only state that it is not 0.

Given this information, the output of the `print(left)` statement will simply be the value of `left`, which is not 0 but whose exact numerical value is unknown from the provided information.

Output: **left (where left is a non-zero value)**
