The code snippet `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`
- `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`
- `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`
- `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`
- `mid` is less than `n`
- `rightZero` is incremented by 1
- `trightOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1'
- `i` is `mid + 1`

After the execution of `trightZero += 1`, the value of `trightZero` increases by 1.

Output State: **`leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`; `mid` is less than `n`; `rightZero` is incremented by 1; `trightZero` is incremented by 1; `trightOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1'; `i` is `mid + 1`.**
