Postcondition: **`left` is 0 if the initial condition is met, otherwise `left` is not 0. `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 2, `t` is `t - 3`, `s` is a string, and `leftMove` is 0. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 and `trightZero` is -1; otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0 and `trightOne` is 1. If `right` is equal to `n`, then in the if part, `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to 2 or less than 1, and in the else part, `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the condition in the if part holds if the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2 - left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2 - right`.**
