The code snippet `right = mid` updates the value of `right` to be equal to the value of `mid`. Given the initial state, `mid` is 1, so `right` will now be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `mid` is 1, `n` is 2, `right` is 1, `t` is `t - (2 - 1)`, `s` is a string, `tleftZero` is `count_zero`, `trightZero` is `zero_count`, `tleftOne` is `count_one`, `trightOne` is `one_count`, `leftMove` is 0. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is -1 and `rightZero` is `zero_count + 1`. Otherwise, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is `zero_count`, `leftOne` is `count_one - 1`, and `rightOne` is 1.**
