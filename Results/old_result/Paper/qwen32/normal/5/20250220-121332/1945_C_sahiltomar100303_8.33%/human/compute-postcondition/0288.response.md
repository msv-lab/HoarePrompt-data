The value of `leftZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `mid` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Since `mid` is at least `i+1` initially, and `i` is incremented by 1, these conditions remain valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`mid` is at least `i+1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `leftZero` is incremented by 1.**
