The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not intend to use. The loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `a` are defined within the loop body and are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust them to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the only thing we need to ensure is that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4**
