To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly computes the minimum total cost required to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using the specified operations.

### Problem Analysis:

The problem involves cyclically shifting substrings of a binary string to sort it. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort the string.

### Approach of the Provided Program:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes two variables, `n` and `ans`. `n` counts the number of '1's encountered so far, and `ans` accumulates the total cost.

2. **Iterating through the String**: For each character in the string:
   - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
   - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero (meaning there are '1's before this '0'), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the accumulated cost `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis:

The core logic of the program hinges on the idea that each '0' that appears after some '1's requires shifting operations to move all the '1's before it to the right of the '0'. The cost for each such operation is the number of '1's encountered before the '0' plus one (the length of the substring from the first '1' to the current '0').

However, this approach does not correctly account for the optimal way to perform these shifts. Specifically, the program does not consider that multiple '0's can be moved together, potentially reducing the number of operations.

### Counterexample:

Consider the input string "101011":

- The program will compute the cost as follows:
  - First '1': `n = 1`, `ans = 0`
  - '0': `ans = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`
  - Second '1': `n = 2`, `ans = 2`
  - Second '0': `ans = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5`
  - Third '1': `n = 3`, `ans = 5`
  - Fourth '1': `n = 4`, `ans = 5`

  This results in a total cost of `5`, which is not optimal.

- An optimal solution would involve fewer operations:
  - Shift "1010" to "0101" (cost = 4)
  - Shift "01011" to "00111" (cost = 5)
  - Total cost = 4 + 1 = 5

However, the program's approach fails to find this optimal solution.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
