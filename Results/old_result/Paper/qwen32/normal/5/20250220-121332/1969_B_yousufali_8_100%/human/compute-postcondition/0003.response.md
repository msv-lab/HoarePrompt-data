The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable, and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0. Since `_` does not affect the loop continuation, we only need to adjust `t`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 1**
