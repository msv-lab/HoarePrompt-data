The code snippet `ans += n + 1` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `n + 1`. The variables `s`, `i`, and `n` are not directly modified by this line, but their states are relevant to the context. Specifically, `i` is `i + 2` and `n` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1'. Based on this, the value of `ans` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`s` is the input binary string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is `i + 2`, and `n` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '1'; `ans` is increased by `n + 1`.**
