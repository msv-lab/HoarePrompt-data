### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on its substrings. The cost of each operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case. `func_1` computes the minimum cost for a single binary string.

Let's analyze the logic within `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `n` is initialized to 0. It counts the number of '1's encountered before a '0'.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0. It accumulates the total cost.

2. **Iterating through the string**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', increment `n` by 1.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0 (meaning there have been '1's before this '0'), add `n + 1` to `ans`. This represents the cost to move the substring ending at the current position to the correct position.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing the entire string, the accumulated `ans` is printed, which represents the minimum cost to sort the string.

The key insight here is that the cost to move a substring ending at a '0' to the correct position is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's encountered before that '0'. This is because each '1' before a '0' needs to be shifted to the right of the '0', and the cost of such a shift is the length of the substring.

The example provided in the problem statement aligns with this logic. For instance, in the third test case (`11000`), the optimal strategy involves shifting substrings in a way that the total cost is 9, which matches the output of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to compute the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
