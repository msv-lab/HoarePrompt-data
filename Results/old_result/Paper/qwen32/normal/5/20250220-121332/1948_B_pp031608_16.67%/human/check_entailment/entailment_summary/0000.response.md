Reasoning:
The provided Python program is intended to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits. However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect.

1. The program uses a function `func_1` to check if the list is sorted, but it is called incorrectly within the loop. The function should be called to check the sorted status of the list after any potential modifications, not within the loop condition.
2. The logic for splitting the elements is flawed. The program only checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and greater than 10, but it does not correctly handle the insertion of digits. The way it splits the number and inserts the digits is incorrect and can lead to incorrect results.
3. The program does not account for the fact that splitting an element might require multiple iterations to sort the list. The current implementation only attempts a single pass through the list.
4. The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when the list is already sorted or when multiple elements need to be split.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the described operation.

Correctness: **False**
