Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array a, where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99, and the length of lst, n, satisfies 2 <= n <= 50. `sorted_lst` is a new list containing the elements of `lst` sorted in non-decreasing order. The function will be called multiple times (1 <= t <= 10^3) with different such lists.**

In simpler terms, the list `lst` remains unchanged, and a new list `sorted_lst` is created which contains the elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order. All other conditions and constraints remain the same.
