Output State: **`ptsb` is a list with two additional elements `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` and `pres[new_i] + rem * s[new_i]`, `pres` must have at least `new_i + 2` elements, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `i` is `new_i + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `rem` has been updated to `k - (i + 1)`. All other variables retain their initial state values.
