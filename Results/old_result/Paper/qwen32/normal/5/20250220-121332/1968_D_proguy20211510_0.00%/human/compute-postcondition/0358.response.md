The code snippet `sb += b[i]` updates the value of `sb` by adding the `i`-th element of the list `b` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `sb` was previously defined as `sb + b[i]`. After executing `sb += b[i]`, `sb` will be `sb + b[i] + b[i]`, which simplifies to `sb + 2 * b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is a list with three elements `[sb + b[i], sb + b[i] + b[i+1], sb + b[i]]`, `pres` is a list containing two elements `[ss + s[i], ss + s[i]]`, `sb` is `sb + 2 * b[i]`, `ss` is `2 * s[i]`, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`**.
