Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b` (now an empty list), `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` (now an empty list), `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b` (now 0), `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s` (now 0), `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1` (now an empty list), `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1` (now an empty list), `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss` (now undefined, as `ptss` is empty), and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` (now undefined, as `ptsb` is empty); if `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb` (now this condition is undefined due to `maxs` and `maxb` being undefined); `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, and the conditions on `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` remain as stated; `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `founds` is `True`, then `s` is a list containing one or two elements, with the last element being `maxa`. If `founds` is `False`, then `s` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is `True`, then `b` is a list containing two elements `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)` and `maxa`. If `foundb` is `False`, then `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `True`, then `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` at the end and `b` is a list containing three elements `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, and `maxa`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `False`, then `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` at the end and `b` is a list containing two elements `a[pb - 1]` and `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`. If `foundb` is `False`, then `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` was `False` and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is updated to `True`. If `foundb` was `False` and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, then `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is `True`, then `s` is a list containing one or two elements, with the last element being `maxa`. If `founds` is `False`, then `s` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, then `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` and `founds` is set to `True`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, then `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` and `pres` are empty lists, `sb` and `ss` are 0, `ptsb` and `ptss` are empty lists, `maxs` and `maxb` are undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. `s` now includes an additional element, which is either `maxa` if `founds` was `True`, or `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to `True`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `True`, `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` at the end and `b` is a list containing three or four elements `a[pb - 1]`, `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, `maxa`, and possibly another `maxa`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `False`, `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` at the end and `b` is a list containing two elements `a[pb - 1]` and `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`. If `foundb` is `False`, `b` is a list containing one or two elements `a[pb - 1]` and possibly `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is updated to `True`. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
