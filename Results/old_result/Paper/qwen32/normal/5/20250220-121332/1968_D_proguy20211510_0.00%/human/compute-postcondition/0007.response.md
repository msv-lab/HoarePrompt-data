The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `a`. This means that the variable `a` will now hold a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input.**
