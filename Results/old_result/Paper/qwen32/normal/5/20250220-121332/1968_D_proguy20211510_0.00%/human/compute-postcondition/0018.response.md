The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Sasha'`. The initial state provides various variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`) and their properties, but these do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
2. The variables `n` and `k` are integers.
3. The variables `pb` and `ps` are integers.
4. The variable `pb` is used to index the list `a`, and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.
5. The variable `ps` is used to index the list `a`, and `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.
6. The list `a` contains integers, and `maxa` is the maximum value in this list.
7. The list `p` is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet.

The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or lists mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Sasha'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **Sasha**
