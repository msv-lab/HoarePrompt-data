Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b` (now an empty list), `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` (now an empty list), `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b` (now 0), `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s` (now 0), `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1` (now an empty list), `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1` (now an empty list), `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss` (now undefined, as `ptss` is empty), and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` (now undefined, as `ptsb` is empty); `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, and the conditions on `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` remain as stated; `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `True`, `foundb` is `True`. Since `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, the condition `(foundb and founds)` is satisfied.**
