The code appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. The values of `n`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that `preb` now includes the new element `sb + b[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is [previous elements of `preb`, `sb + b[i]`], `pres` is [], `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `s` must be a list with at least one element**.
