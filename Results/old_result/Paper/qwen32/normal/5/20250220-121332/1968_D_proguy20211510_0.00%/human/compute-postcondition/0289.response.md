Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, and the conditions on `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` remain as stated. `foundb` is `False`. Additionally, `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**
