The given code snippet appends a new element to the `ptsb` list. The new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer greater than 0
- `pb` and `ps` are integers
- `preb` is a list with `len(s)` elements representing cumulative sums of `b`
- `pres` is a list with at least one element
- `sb` is the total sum of all elements in `b`
- `ss` is the total sum of all elements in `s`
- `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]`
- `ptss` is a list with an additional element `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` and another element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`
- `maxs` is undefined
- `maxb` is undefined
- `p` is a list of integers read from input
- `a` is a list of integers read from input
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`
- `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution
- `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution
- `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`
- `i` is `i + 1`

The code snippet modifies `ptsb` by appending a new element, so the new `ptsb` will have one more element than before.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is a list with `len(s)` elements representing cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is the total sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the total sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` and another element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: `n` remains an integer, `k` remains an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` remain integers, `preb` remains a list with `len(s)` elements representing cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` remains a list with at least one element, `sb` remains the total sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` remains the total sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` now includes an additional element calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` remains a list with an additional element `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` and another element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `maxs` is still undefined, `maxb` is still undefined, `p` remains a list of integers read from input, `a` remains a list of integers read from input, `maxa` remains the maximum value in `a`, `b` remains a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `s` remains a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `rem` remains `k - (i + 1)`, `i` remains `i + 1`.
