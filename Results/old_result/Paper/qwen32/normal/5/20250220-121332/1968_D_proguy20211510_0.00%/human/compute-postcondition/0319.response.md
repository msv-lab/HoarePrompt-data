The code snippet `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element at index `ps - 1` of list `a` to the list `s`. Since `founds` is `True`, `s` already contains one or two elements, with the last element being `maxa`. After appending `a[ps - 1]`, `s` will have an additional element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `True`, then `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` at the end and `b` is a list containing three elements `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`, and `maxa`. If `foundb` is `True` and `founds` is `False`, then `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` at the end and `b` is a list containing two elements `a[pb - 1]` and `((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)`. If `foundb` is `False`, then `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` was `False` and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is updated to `True`. If `foundb` was `False` and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, then `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` and `b` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is `True`, then `s` is a list containing one or two elements, with the last element being `maxa`, and now it has an additional element `a[ps - 1]`. If `founds` is `False`, then `s` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`. `i` is `i_prev + 1`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`. `founds` is True.**
