The code snippet appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. The new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Given that `rem` is defined as `k - (i + 1)`, the new element can also be expressed as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]`.

After this operation, the list `ptsb` will have one additional element, and the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `rem`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is a list with `len(s)` elements representing cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is the total sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the total sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]`, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
