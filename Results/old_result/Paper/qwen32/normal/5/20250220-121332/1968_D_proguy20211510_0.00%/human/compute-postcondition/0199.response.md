The code appends a new element to the list `b`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. This means the length of `b` increases by 1, and the last element of `b` is now `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.

The other variables retain their initial values unless they are dependent on `b`. Since `ptsb` is dependent on `b`, it will also be affected. The new `ptsb` list will be recalculated as `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1], preb[len(pres)] + (k - (len(pres) + 1)) * b[len(pres)]]`.

Since `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list, its value will be recalculated based on the new `ptsb` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres) + 1` elements `[preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1], ..., preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1], preb[len(pres)] + (k - (len(pres) + 1)) * b[len(pres)]]`, `founds` is a boolean, `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list, `maxb` is the maximum value in the new `ptsb` list, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `foundb` retains its initial value, `b` is a list with one additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `i` is `i + 1`**
