The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `p`. This operation does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is a list with `len(pres)` elements calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`; `p` is a list of integers read from input.**
