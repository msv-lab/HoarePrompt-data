The code snippet appends a new value to the list `b`. This new value is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 before this code snippet, we use the updated value of `i` in the calculation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `i` is `i + 1`; `b` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to it.**
