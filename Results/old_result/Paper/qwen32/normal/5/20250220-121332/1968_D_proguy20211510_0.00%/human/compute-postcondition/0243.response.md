Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 1 element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ptsb` now includes the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`**

Natural Language: The variable `ptsb` has been updated to include an additional element, which is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged, including `n`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptss`, `rem`, and `i` (which has been incremented by 1).
