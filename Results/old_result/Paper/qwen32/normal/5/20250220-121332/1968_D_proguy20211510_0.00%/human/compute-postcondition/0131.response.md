The `print('Draw')` statement will output the string 'Draw' as it is specified in the code. The variables `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are described in the initial state, but they do not influence the output of the `print` statement because the statement is simply printing the string 'Draw'.

Here's the breakdown:

- `ptsb` is a list calculated based on the elements of `preb`, `b`, and `k`.
- `ptss` is a list calculated based on the elements of `pres`, `s`, and `k`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in the `ptss` list.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in the `ptsb` list.
- It is given that `maxs` is equal to `maxb`.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The statement is hardcoded to print the string 'Draw'.

Output: **Draw**
