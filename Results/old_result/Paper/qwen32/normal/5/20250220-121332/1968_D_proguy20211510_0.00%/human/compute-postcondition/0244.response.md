Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `preb` is a list of cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list of cumulative sums of `s` that must have at least 1 element, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ptsb` now includes the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` now includes the new element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`.**

In simple terms, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the list `ptss` now includes an additional element, which is the result of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
