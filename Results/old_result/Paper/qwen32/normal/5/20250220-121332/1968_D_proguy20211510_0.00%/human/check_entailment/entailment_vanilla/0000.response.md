Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. 
   - It converts these inputs to appropriate types (integers for `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, and lists for `p` and `a`).

2. **Immediate Decision Based on Maximum Element:**
   - The program checks if the elements at Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions are both equal to the maximum element in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya's starting position element is the maximum, it prints "Bodya".
   - If only Sasha's starting position element is the maximum, it prints "Sasha".
   - This part appears to be correct because if the maximum element is at either player's starting position, that player will eventually collect the maximum score, and the game can be decided immediately.

3. **Simulating the Game:**
   - The program initializes lists `b` and `s` to keep track of the scores Bodya and Sasha earn in each turn.
   - It also initializes flags `foundb` and `founds` to indicate if either player has reached the maximum element.
   - For up to `k` turns, the program:
     - Updates Bodya's and Sasha's scores based on their current positions.
     - Moves Bodya and Sasha to their next positions (`p[pb-1]` and `p[ps-1]` respectively) unless they have already reached the maximum element.
     - If either player reaches the maximum element, the program sets the corresponding flag and continues to add the maximum element to their scores for the remaining turns.
   - This part seems correct as it correctly simulates the game for up to `k` turns.

4. **Calculating Total Scores:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of `b` and `s` to get cumulative scores at each turn.
   - It then calculates the potential total scores for Bodya and Sasha if they continue to collect their current scores for the remaining turns.
   - This part also seems correct as it calculates the total scores based on the game's rules.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum potential total scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner accordingly.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints "Draw".
   - This part is correct as it correctly determines the winner based on the total scores.

### Conclusion

After carefully analyzing the program, it appears to correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on the rules provided in the problem statement. The program handles all edge cases and efficiently computes the result for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
