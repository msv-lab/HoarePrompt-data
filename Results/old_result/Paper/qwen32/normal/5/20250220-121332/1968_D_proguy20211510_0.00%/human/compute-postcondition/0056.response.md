The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most inner loop or if statement it is nested within, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `i`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop or if statement is exited.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `i` is `i + 1`; `b` has a new element appended which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`; `s` has a new element appended which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
