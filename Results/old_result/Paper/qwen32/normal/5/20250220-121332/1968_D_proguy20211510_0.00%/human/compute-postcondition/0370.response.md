The given code snippet appends a new element to the `ptss` list. This new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, where `rem` is defined as `k - (i + 1)`.

The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, and `rem` are not directly affected by this line of code. However, `ptss` is updated by adding a new element.

Given that `ptss` already has an additional element `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` as per the initial state, the new state will have one more element appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is a list with `len(s)` elements representing cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is the total sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the total sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is a list with an additional element `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` and another element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `maxs` is undefined, `maxb` is undefined, `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `s` is a list of integers accumulated based on the loop execution, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

In simpler terms, `ptss` now has one more element appended to it, which is `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
