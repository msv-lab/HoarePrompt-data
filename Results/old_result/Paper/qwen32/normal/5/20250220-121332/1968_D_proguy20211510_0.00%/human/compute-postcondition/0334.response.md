Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer; `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `maxs` is undefined, and `maxb` is undefined; `p` is a list of integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `foundb` is `True`, `b` includes `a[pb - 1]`, and `i` is `i + 1` with a break from the loop. Otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `b` includes `a[pb - 1]`, and `i` is `i + 1` with a break from the loop. The state of `s` and `founds` remains unchanged unless `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, in which case `s` has an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` at the end and `b` includes an additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**
