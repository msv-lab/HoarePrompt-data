Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then `foundb` is True and `b` contains the value `maxa`; otherwise, `foundb` is False and `b` contains the value `a[pb - 1]`. In both cases, `a[ps - 1]` remains unchanged, `founds` remains as it was before the if statement, and `s` remains an empty list.**
