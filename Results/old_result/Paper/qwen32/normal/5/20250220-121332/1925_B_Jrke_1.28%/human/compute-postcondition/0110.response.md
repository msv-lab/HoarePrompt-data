The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `n`. Both `x` and `n` are integers, with constraints such that `1 <= n <= x` and `1 <= x <= 10^8`. The function is called `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^3`. 

For each test case, the function performs some operation based on the values of `x` and `n`. The specific operation is not detailed, but based on the provided output structure, we can infer the following:

- **Case 1**: The function returns a specific result based on the values of `x` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `x` and `n` for each of the `t` test cases, with constraints `1 <= n <= x` and `1 <= x <= 10^8`. It returns a result based on the values of `x` and `n` for each test case.**
