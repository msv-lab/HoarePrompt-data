Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x % i == 0`, then `l` contains the value `ans` and the new value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 2 and is still less than `int(x)`. If `x // i <= k`, `l` now contains the value `x // i`. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged.**
