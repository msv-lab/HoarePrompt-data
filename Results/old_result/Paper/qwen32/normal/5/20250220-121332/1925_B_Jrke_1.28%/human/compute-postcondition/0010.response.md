Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, and `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. If `k` is 1, then the current value of `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` is not 1. `ans` is 1. `l` is a list containing the single element `1`.**

The list `l` has been created and initialized with the single element `1`, which is the value of `ans`. All other variables retain their initial values.
