The code snippet `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains the single element `1`. After appending `i`, `l` will now contain two elements: `1` and `i`.

The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is at least 4, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, and `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. The current value of `k` is 1 or `k` is not 1, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`. `ans` is 1. `l` is a list containing the elements `[1, i]`.**
