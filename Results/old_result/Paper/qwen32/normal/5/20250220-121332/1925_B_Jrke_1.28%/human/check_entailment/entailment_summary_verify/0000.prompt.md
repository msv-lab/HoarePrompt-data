You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
For each of the `t` test cases, the function takes two integers `x` and `n` as input, with `1 <= n <= x` and `1 <= x <= 10^8`. It calculates the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `n` and prints this value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and see if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

The task is to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset of `n` sub-problems such that the sum of their difficulties is `x`. The provided program attempts to achieve this by iterating through potential divisors of `x` and checking if they can be used to form a valid problemset.

Here is the provided code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Check for `k == 1`**:
   - If `k = x // n == 1`, it implies that the smallest possible difficulty for each problem is 1. In this case, the GCD of all problems will be 1. This is handled correctly.

2. **Iterating Through Divisors**:
   - The program iterates through potential divisors of `x` starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is odd) up to the square root of `x`. This is a reasonable approach to find divisors.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be a valid difficulty (i.e., less than or equal to `k`).

3. **Updating `ans`**:
   - The program keeps track of the maximum valid divisor found (`ans`).

### Potential Issues:

1. **Even `x` Handling**:
   - The loop starts from 2 if `x` is even, but it should start from 1 to ensure that all possible divisors are considered. This is a potential issue because the loop might skip some valid divisors.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: When `x` is a prime number and `n == 1`, the maximum balance should be `x` itself, but the program will return 1.
   - **Case 2**: When `x` is a perfect square and `n == 1`, the maximum balance should be `sqrt(x)`, but the program might not handle this correctly.

### Testing with Edge Cases:

Let's test the program with some edge cases:

1. **Case 1**: `x = 7`, `n = 1`
   - Expected Output: `7` (since the only sub-problem can have difficulty 7)
   - Actual Output: `1` (the program will return 1 because it does not handle the case where `n == 1` correctly)

2. **Case 2**: `x = 9`, `n = 1`
   - Expected Output: `3` (since the only sub-problem can have difficulty 3)
   - Actual Output: `1` (the program will return 1 because it does not handle the case where `n == 1` correctly)

3. **Case 3**: `x = 10`, `n = 2`
   - Expected Output: `2` (since the sub-problems can have difficulties 2 and 8, or 5 and 5, etc.)
   - Actual Output: `2` (the program correctly returns 2)

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle the case where `n == 1` correctly. In such cases, the maximum balance should be `x` itself if `x` is less than or equal to `n`, or the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
