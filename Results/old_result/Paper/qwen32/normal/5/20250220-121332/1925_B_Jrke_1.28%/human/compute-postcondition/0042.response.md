Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer provided by the input, `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is the maximum value among 1 and all valid divisors `i` and `x // i` that are less than or equal to `k`. If `k` equals 1, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.**
