### Reasoning:
The program aims to find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve by breaking up a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. The balance is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. For each test case, read the values of `x` and `n`.
2. Compute `k` as the integer division of `x` by `n` (`k = x // n`). This value represents the maximum possible difficulty of each sub-problem if the difficulties are distributed as evenly as possible.
3. Initialize `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible balance.
4. Iterate through potential divisors of `x` starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x`. This loop checks for divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`.
5. For each divisor `i` found, check if it and its complement divisor (`x // i`) are less than or equal to `k`. If so, update `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.
6. Print the final value of `ans` for each test case.

The key insight here is that the maximum balance is the largest divisor of `x` that is also less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the difficulties of the sub-problems can sum up to `x` while maintaining the highest possible GCD among them.

### Example Walkthrough:
- For the first test case (`x = 10`, `n = 3`):
  - `k = 10 // 3 = 3`
  - The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. Among these, 1 and 2 are less than or equal to 3.
  - The maximum divisor is 2, so the output is 2.
  
- For the second test case (`x = 5`, `n = 5`):
  - `k = 5 // 5 = 1`
  - The only divisor of 5 that is less than or equal to 1 is 1.
  - The output is 1.
  
- For the third test case (`x = 420`, `n = 69`):
  - `k = 420 // 69 = 5`
  - The divisors of 420 that are less than or equal to 5 are 1 and 5.
  - The maximum divisor is 5, so the output is 5.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance by iterating through the divisors of `x` and selecting the largest one that is less than or equal to `k`.
