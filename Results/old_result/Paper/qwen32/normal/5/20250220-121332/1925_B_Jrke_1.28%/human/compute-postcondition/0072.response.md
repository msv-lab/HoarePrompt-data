To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `x` is the first integer provided by the input.
   - `n` is the second integer provided by the input such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
   - `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, i.e., `k = x // n`.
   - `ans` is the maximum factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. If no such factor exists, `ans` remains 1.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code snippet contains a single `print` statement: `print(ans)`.

3. **Determine `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the maximum factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - To find `ans`, we need to identify all factors of `x` and select the largest one that does not exceed `k`.

4. **Output Explanation:**
   - The value of `ans` depends on the values of `x` and `k`.
   - Since `x` and `n` are provided by the input, `k` is determined as `x // n`.
   - The exact value of `ans` can only be determined once `x` and `n` are known, but we can describe its computation.

Given the above analysis, the output will be the maximum factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum factor of x that is less than or equal to k, and k is the integer division of x by n)**
