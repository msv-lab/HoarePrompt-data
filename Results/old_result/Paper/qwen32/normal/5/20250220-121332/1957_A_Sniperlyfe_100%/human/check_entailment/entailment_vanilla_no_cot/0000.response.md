Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by assuming that each polygon needs at least 3 sticks of the same length (which is correct for triangles), but it does not consider polygons with more than 3 sides. 

The correct approach should be to check for all possible polygons (triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.), not just triangles. For each unique stick length, we should check how many polygons of each possible size (from 3 up to the number of sticks of that length) can be formed and keep track of the total number of polygons.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    total_polygons = 0
    for length, count in freq.items():
        for sides in range(3, count + 1):  # Check polygons from triangle upwards
            total_polygons += count // sides
            count %= sides  # Remaining sticks after forming polygons with 'sides' number of sides
    return total_polygons

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))
```

This version of the function iterates over each unique stick length and checks how many polygons of each possible size can be formed, updating the total count of polygons accordingly.
