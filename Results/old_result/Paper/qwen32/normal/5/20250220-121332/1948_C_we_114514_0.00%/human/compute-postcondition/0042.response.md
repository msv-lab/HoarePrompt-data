Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False. If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', the condition inside the if statement is evaluated. Otherwise, the condition is not met and no changes are made to the variables.**
