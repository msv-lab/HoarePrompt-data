### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to determine whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a 2xN grid based on the direction of arrows in each cell. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `reachable_first_row` is initialized to `True`, indicating that the robot starts in the first row.
   - `reachable_second_row` is initialized to `False`, indicating that the robot has not yet reached the second row.

2. **Iterating through the columns**:
   - For each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`, the program checks the reachability:
     - If `reachable_first_row` is `True`:
       - If the arrow in `row1[j]` is `'>`' and `j` is not the last column, the robot stays in the first row.
       - If the arrow in `row1[j]` is `'<'`:
         - The robot cannot move further left in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
         - If the arrow in `row2[j]` is `'>`' and `j` is not the last column, the robot moves to the second row, so `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`.
     - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
       - If the arrow in `row2[j]` is `'>`' and `j` is not the last column, the robot stays in the second row.
       - If the arrow in `row2[j]` is `'<'` and `j` is not the last column, the robot moves to the first row.
       - If `j` is the last column, `reachable_second_row` remains `True` as the robot has reached the last column of the second row.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After iterating through all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it means the robot can reach the cell (2, n), so the result is `'YES'`.
   - Otherwise, the result is `'NO'`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic for `reachable_second_row` is incomplete. Once `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`, it does not consider the subsequent arrows in the second row correctly. Specifically, the program does not handle cases where the robot moves back to the first row from the second row.
- The program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement between rows based on the arrows.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the logic, the program does not correctly determine the reachability of the cell (2, n) in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
