Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is False. Additionally, `row1[j]` is not equal to '>'. The current value of `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is equal to '>'**
