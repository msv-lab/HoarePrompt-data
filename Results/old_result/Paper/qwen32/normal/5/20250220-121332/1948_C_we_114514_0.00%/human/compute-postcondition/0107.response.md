The code snippet appends the string `'NO'` to the `results` list. However, the `results` list is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can infer that it must exist and be a list to which `'NO'` can be appended. The values of the other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `row1`, `row2`, `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is ['NO']**.
