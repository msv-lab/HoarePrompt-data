Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` was less than `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration), `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True. If `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` retains its value. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` retains its value as well.**
