Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4), and `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, n is even) and two strings of length `n` consisting of the characters '<' and/or '>'. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the end of the second string (`row2`) from the start of the first string (`row1`) for each test case.**
