Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", and `reachable_second_row` is True. The current value of `row2[j]` is '>', and `reachable_first_row` can be either True or False depending on the previous conditions. If `row1[j]` was '>', `reachable_first_row` remains True; otherwise, `reachable_first_row` becomes False.**
