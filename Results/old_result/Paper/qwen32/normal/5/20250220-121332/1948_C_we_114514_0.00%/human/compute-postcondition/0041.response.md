Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1`, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In natural language: The variable `reachable_second_row` has been set to `True`. All other variables retain their original values.
