Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is ['NO'], `j` is 2. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `row1[j]` is '>', `reachable_first_row` remains either True or False. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `row1[j]` is not '>', `reachable_first_row` becomes False unless `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', in which case `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged. If `reachable_first_row` is False, no changes are made to `reachable_first_row`.**

The value of `reachable_second_row` has been set to True. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
