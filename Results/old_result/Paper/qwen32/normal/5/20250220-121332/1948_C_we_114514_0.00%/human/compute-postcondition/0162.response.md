Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is either True or False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is ['NO', 'YES']. Otherwise, `results` is ['NO', 'NO'].**
