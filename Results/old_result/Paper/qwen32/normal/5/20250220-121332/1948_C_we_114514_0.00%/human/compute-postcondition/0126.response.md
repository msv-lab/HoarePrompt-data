Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is either True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True. If `reachable_first_row` was initially True and `row1[j]` was '>', then `reachable_first_row` remains True, and `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` equals `n - 1`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False. If `reachable_first_row` was initially True and `row1[j]` was not '>', then `reachable_first_row` becomes False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False. If `reachable_first_row` was initially False, then `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged. `results` is ['NO']. The current value of `reachable_second_row` is True.**
