Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 2, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is either True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is ['NO']. If `row2[j]` is '>', then if `j` is `n - 1` (which is 1), `reachable_second_row` remains True. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.**
