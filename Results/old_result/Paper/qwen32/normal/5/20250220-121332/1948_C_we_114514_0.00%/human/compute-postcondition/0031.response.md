Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>")], `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `j + 1` (where `j` was less than `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration), `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` retains its value from the end of the previous iteration if `j` equals `n - 1` or `row1[j]` is not '>', and `reachable_first_row` is set to False if `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is '>', `reachable_second_row` is True.**
