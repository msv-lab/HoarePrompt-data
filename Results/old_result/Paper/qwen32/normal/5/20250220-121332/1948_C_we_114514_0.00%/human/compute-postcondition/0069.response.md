Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is [(2, "<>", "<>"), (3, "<>", "<>")], `n` is 3, `row1` is "<>", `row2` is "<>", `reachable_first_row` is False, and `row1[j]` is not equal to '>'. If `j` is less than `n - 1` and `row2[j]` is equal to '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False.**
