### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to determine if a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) in a 2xN grid with arrows pointing either left or right. Let's analyze the logic of the code to ensure it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initialization:**
   - The code initializes two boolean variables, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to track whether the robot can reach the end of `row1` and `row2` respectively.
   - `reachable_first_row` is initialized to `True` because the robot starts at the beginning of `row1`.
   - `reachable_second_row` is initialized to `False` because the robot starts in `row1`, not `row2`.

2. **Iteration through columns:**
   - The code iterates through each column `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - If the robot can reach the current column `j` in `row1` (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in `row1` at column `j` points right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If `j` is the last column (`j == n-1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can reach the end of `row2`.
     - If the arrow in `row1` at column `j` points left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - The robot cannot stay in `row1`, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
       - If `j` is not the last column and the arrow in `row2` at column `j` points right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because the robot can move to `row2` and continue moving right.
   - If the robot can reach the current column `j` in `row2` (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in `row2` at column `j` points right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If `j` is the last column (`j == n-1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (though this is redundant since it's already `True`).

3. **Result determination:**
   - After iterating through all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, the robot can reach the end of `row2`, and the result is `'YES'`.
   - Otherwise, the result is `'NO'`.

### Issues:
- The logic for determining reachability in `row2` is incomplete. Specifically, the code does not account for the possibility of the robot moving up from `row2` to `row1` and then continuing to move right in `row1` before moving down to `row2` again.
- The code does not handle the scenario where the robot can move between `row1` and `row2` multiple times to eventually reach the end of `row2`.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly handle all scenarios for reaching the end of `row2` from the start of `row1`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
