Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the robot's movement. Specifically, the program does not account for the robot's ability to move between rows (up or down) after its initial move. The logic in the function `func_1` only considers the robot's ability to move right within the rows, and it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement between rows based on the arrows.

Let's consider a test case where the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) but the program will output "NO":

### Test Case:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

### Explanation of the Test Case:
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- In the first second, it can move to (2, 1) (down) and then follow the arrow to (2, 2).
- In the second second, it can move to (1, 2) (up) and then follow the arrow to (1, 3).
- In the third second, it can move to (2, 3) (down) and then follow the arrow to (2, 4).

The robot successfully reaches (2, 4) in this case, so the correct output should be "YES". However, the provided program will output "NO" because it does not correctly simulate the robot's ability to move between rows.

### Why the Program Fails:
The program only considers the robot's ability to move right within each row and does not account for the possibility of moving between rows (up or down) after the initial move. This means it fails to correctly simulate the robot's path and determine if the target cell (2, n) can be reached.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
