Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most 2 times, and a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns the count of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 2 times in the list `a`.**
