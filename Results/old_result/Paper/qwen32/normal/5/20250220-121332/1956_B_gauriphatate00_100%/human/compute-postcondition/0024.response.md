Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, `max_score` is 2. Otherwise, `max_score` remains 1, `num` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `max_score` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
