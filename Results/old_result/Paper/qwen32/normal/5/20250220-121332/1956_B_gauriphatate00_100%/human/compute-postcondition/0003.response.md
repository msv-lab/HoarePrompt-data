Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `count_a` is a dictionary that has at least one key-value pair where the key is `num` and the value is the count of `num` in `a` incremented by 1.**

Natural language explanation: The count of `num` in the dictionary `count_a` is increased by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
