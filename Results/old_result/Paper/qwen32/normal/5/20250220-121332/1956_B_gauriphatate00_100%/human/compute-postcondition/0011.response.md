The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether there are more elements in the list `a` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last element processed from the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `a` that has not yet been processed.

So, `num` should be the next element in the list `a` that has not been processed yet.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `count_a` is a dictionary. If `num` was already a key in `count_a`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_a` has `num` as a key with a value of 1. `num` is the next element in the list `a` that has not yet been processed.**
