The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which is the current element being iterated over from the list `nums`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `x` needs to be updated to the next element in `nums`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1
- `n` is the input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is incremented by 1
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element
- `res` is the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for all `cnt` ≥ 3 and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for all `cnt` ≥ 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the last element processed. To start the next iteration, `x` should be the next element in `nums`. Assuming `t` is an index used to keep track of the current position in `nums`, `t` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element, `res` is the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for all `cnt` ≥ 3 and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for all `cnt` ≥ 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`, `x` is `nums[t + 1]`**
