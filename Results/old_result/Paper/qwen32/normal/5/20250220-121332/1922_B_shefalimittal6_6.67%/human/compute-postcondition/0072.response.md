The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `res`) remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by this code snippet.

Given this, the Output State would be:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the sum of math.comb(cnt, 3) for all cnt ≥ 3 and math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum for all cnt ≥ 2, where total_sum is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals cnt.**

In simpler terms, the list `nums` now contains the integers from the input, while all other variables retain their initial state.
