Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary that contains each unique number from the `nums` list as a key, and the value will be how many times that number appears in the list. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
