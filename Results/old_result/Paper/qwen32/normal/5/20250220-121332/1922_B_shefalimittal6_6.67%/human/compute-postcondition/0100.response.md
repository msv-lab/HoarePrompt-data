The code snippet increments `res` by the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum`. This means `res` is updated to include this additional value.

Given:
- `res` is initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum` (plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3).
- `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` after `next_cnt`.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `cnt`.

After executing the code, `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its initial value.

Output State: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` after `next_cnt`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `cnt`, `res` is initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum` (plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3) and then incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**
