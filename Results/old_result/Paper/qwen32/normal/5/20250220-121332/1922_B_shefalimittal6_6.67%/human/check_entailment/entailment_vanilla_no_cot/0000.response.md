Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, it does not correctly implement the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any three sides of a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

The program currently only considers combinations of sticks with the same length and combinations of sticks with two of the same length and one different length, but it does not check if the selected sticks can actually form a triangle.

To fix the program, you would need to iterate through all possible combinations of three sticks and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums = [2 ** x for x in nums]
        nums.sort()
        res = 0
        for a, b, c in combinations(nums, 3):
            if a + b > c:
                res += 1
        print(res)

func()
```

This version of the program first calculates the actual lengths of the sticks, sorts them, and then iterates through all combinations of three sticks to check if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. This ensures that only valid triangles are counted. However, this version may not be efficient enough for the given constraints, as it uses combinations which can be computationally expensive for large `n`.

For a more efficient solution, you would need to use a different approach, such as counting sticks with the same length and using mathematical formulas to count valid combinations, while still ensuring the triangle inequality is satisfied.
