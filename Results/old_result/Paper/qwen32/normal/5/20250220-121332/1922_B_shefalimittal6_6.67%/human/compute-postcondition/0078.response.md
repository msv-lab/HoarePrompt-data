The code snippet provided increments the count of `x` in the `num_of_lens` dictionary by 1. Since `x` is defined as `nums[t + 1]`, the count of the element at the `t + 1` index in the `nums` list is incremented in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` (which is `nums[t + 1]`) is incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must contain at least one element, `res` is the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for all `cnt` ≥ 3 and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for all `cnt` ≥ 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`, `x` is `nums[t + 1]`.**
