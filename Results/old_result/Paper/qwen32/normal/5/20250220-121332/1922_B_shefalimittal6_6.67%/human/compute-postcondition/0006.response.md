The code snippet updates the `num_of_lens` dictionary by incrementing the count of the key `x`. If `x` is not already a key in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1. If `x` is already a key, its count is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element

The code modifies `num_of_lens` by adding or updating the count for the key `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.**
