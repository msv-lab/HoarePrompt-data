The code snippet updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing the count of the key `x` by 1. If `x` is not already a key in the dictionary, it is added with a value of 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in `nums`. The value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**
