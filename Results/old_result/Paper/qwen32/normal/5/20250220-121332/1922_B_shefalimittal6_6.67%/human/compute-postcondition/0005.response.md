To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for x in nums:`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` is in a state that allows the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `x`**: This is a loop variable that takes on the value of each element in `nums` during each iteration. We don't need to adjust `x` before the loop starts because it is assigned automatically during each iteration.

2. **List `nums`**: The loop will execute if `nums` contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty.

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they are part of the initial state, so we will include them in the final state description.

Given the above points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `nums` has at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element**.
