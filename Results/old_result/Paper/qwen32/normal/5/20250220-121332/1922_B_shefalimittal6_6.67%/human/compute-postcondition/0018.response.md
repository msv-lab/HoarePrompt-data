Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, otherwise `res` remains 0; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `total_sum` is calculated as the sum of all values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` that are not equal to `cnt`. All other variables retain their initial values.
