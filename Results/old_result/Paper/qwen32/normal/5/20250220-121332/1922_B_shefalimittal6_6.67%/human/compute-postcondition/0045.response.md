Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique integer `x` from `nums` has a count of how many times it appears; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed for all iterations, `num_of_lens` will have a count of each unique integer in the `nums` list. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `res` will be the accumulated sum of combinations based on these counts, although the code snippet provided does not directly modify `res` within the loop.
