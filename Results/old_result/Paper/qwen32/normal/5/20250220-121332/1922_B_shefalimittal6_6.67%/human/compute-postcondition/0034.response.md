To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables involved.

1. **t**: This is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). It seems to represent the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the current `print(res)` statement.

2. **n**: This is an input integer, but its exact value is not specified. It likely represents the number of elements in the `nums` list.

3. **nums**: This is a list of integers obtained from the input. The exact values of the integers in the list are not provided, but we know the list contains `n` integers.

4. **num_of_lens**: This is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from the `nums` list, and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`. For example, if `nums` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `num_of_lens` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`.

5. **res**: This is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the counts in `num_of_lens`. The exact method to calculate `res` is not provided, but it is based on the counts of the integers in `nums`.

Given the information, `res` is calculated in some way using the counts of integers in `nums`. Since the exact method of calculation is not provided, we cannot determine the numerical value of `res`. However, we can describe it in terms of the counts in `num_of_lens`.

Output: **res (where res is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the counts in num_of_lens)**
