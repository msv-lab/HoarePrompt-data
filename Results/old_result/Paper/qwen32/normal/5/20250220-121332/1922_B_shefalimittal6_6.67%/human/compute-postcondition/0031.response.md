The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` increments the value of `res` by the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum`. Here, `math.comb(cnt, 2)` calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items, which is equivalent to the binomial coefficient \( \binom{cnt}{2} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is calculated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum` and is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

The only variable that changes is `res`, which is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Therefore, the updated value of `res` is the previous value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`, `res` is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.**
