Output State: **`t` is 0; for each of the initial `t` test cases, `res` holds the final calculated sum of combinations based on the counts of each unique element in `nums`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements itself implicitly with each iteration. For each test case, `res` will contain the final computed value, which is the sum of combinations based on how many times each unique number appears in the list `nums`. The other variables (`n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`) will not retain their values from the last iteration as they are re-initialized in each iteration of the loop.
