The only object in the loop head is the variable `x`, which iterates over the elements of the list `nums`. To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of `nums`. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `nums` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `res`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element; `res` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the counts in `num_of_lens`**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once because `nums` contains at least one element for `x` to iterate over.
