Postcondition: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one unique element. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
