The code snippet increments the count of the integer `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If `x` is not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added with a count of 1. If `x` is already a key, its count is incremented by 1.

Given the initial state, `t` and `n` remain unchanged. `nums` and `x` also remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `num_of_lens` where the count of `x` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least two elements, `x` is the next element in `nums`.**
