The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in the list `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `res` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the counts in `num_of_lens`**.

In simpler terms, `nums` now contains the integers from the input, while all other variables retain their initial values.
