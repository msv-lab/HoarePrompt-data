To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the formula for `res`.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique integer \( x \) from `nums` has a count of how many times it appears.
- `res` is calculated as the sum of two parts:
  1. The sum of \(\text{math.comb}(cnt, 3)\) for all \( cnt \geq 3 \).
  2. The sum of \(\text{math.comb}(cnt, 2) \times \text{total\_sum}\) for all \( cnt \geq 2 \), where \(\text{total\_sum}\) is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals \( cnt \).

### Calculation of `res`:
1. **\(\text{math.comb}(cnt, 3)\) for all \( cnt \geq 3 \)**:
   - This part calculates the number of ways to choose 3 elements from a set of `cnt` elements. It is added to `res` only if `cnt` is at least 3.

2. **\(\text{math.comb}(cnt, 2) \times \text{total\_sum}\) for all \( cnt \geq 2 \)**:
   - This part calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of `cnt` elements and multiplies it by the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` except for the count of the current element. It is added to `res` only if `cnt` is at least 2.

### Final Output:
The `res` variable is the sum of these two parts. Since the exact values of `nums` and `num_of_lens` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `res`.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of math.comb(cnt, 3) for all cnt ≥ 3 and math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum for all cnt ≥ 2, with total_sum being the sum of all values in num_of_lens except for the value that equals cnt)**
