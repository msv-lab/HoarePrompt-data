The code snippet adds the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time to the variable `res`. Given the initial state, the value of `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to it. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one unique element, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` after `next_cnt`, `res` is initially calculated based on `next_cnt` and `total_sum` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `next_cnt`**.
