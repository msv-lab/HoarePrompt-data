In the given task, the for loop iterates `t` times. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `t`. Since the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that does not need to be initialized or adjusted before the loop starts.

Given the state before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range for the loop to execute. Since the problem states that `t` is already assigned the value read from the input and is within the range 1 to 10^4, no adjustment is necessary for `t` itself.

However, to be explicit and adhere to the format, we can state that `t` must be within the given range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
