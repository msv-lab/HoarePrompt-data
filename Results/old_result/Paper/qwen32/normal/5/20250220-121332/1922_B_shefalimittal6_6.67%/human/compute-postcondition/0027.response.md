The only variable in the loop head is `cnt`, which is iterating over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the next value that `cnt` will take from `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `res` is calculated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum`.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `cnt` should be updated to the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

Since we don't have specific values for `num_of_lens` or the current `cnt`, we can only express the next state in terms of the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is calculated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value that equals `cnt`**.
