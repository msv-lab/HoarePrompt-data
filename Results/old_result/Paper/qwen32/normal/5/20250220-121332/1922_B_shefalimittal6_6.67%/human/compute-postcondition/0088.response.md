The code snippet modifies the value of `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one unique element
- `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `cnt`

After executing the code snippet:
- `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`

Output State: **`t` is `n - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least one unique element, the current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. Otherwise, `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the value equal to `cnt`.**
