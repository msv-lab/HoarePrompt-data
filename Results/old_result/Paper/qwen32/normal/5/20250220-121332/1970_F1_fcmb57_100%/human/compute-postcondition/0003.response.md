Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` representing the number of lines in the field, a list of strings `b` representing the field, and an integer `T` representing the number of steps in the game. It processes a series of actions performed by entities in the field and returns the result of `x + int(dx), y + int(dy)`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `dx` and `dy` are the first and second strings in the list `b` respectively, converted to integers.**
