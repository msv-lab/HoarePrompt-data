### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is correctly defined in the code and is used to update the position of a player based on the given movement. The function takes a tuple `a` representing the current position `(x, y)` and a tuple `b` representing the movement `(dx, dy)`, and returns the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
   - The function summary provided matches the implementation of `func_1` in the code.

2. **Handling of Ball Catching and Throwing:**
   - The program does not handle the action of catching (`C`) and throwing (`T`) the Quaffle correctly. The code does not track which player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - The program only checks if a player is in a goal when throwing the Quaffle, but it does not account for catching the Quaffle.
   - There is no mechanism to track which player is carrying the Quaffle, which means the program cannot correctly determine if the Quaffle is being thrown from the player's possession.

3. **Goal Scoring Logic:**
   - The program checks if a player is in a goal when throwing the Quaffle, but it does not check which team's goal it is. If a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the code incorrectly awards a point to the same team.
   - The program should check if the player is in the opponent's goal before awarding a point.
   - The code also does not update the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Movement Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined and used correctly in the code to handle player movements.

5. **Goal Position Handling:**
   - The code correctly stores the positions of goals in the `goals` dictionary, but it does not correctly handle the logic for scoring points based on which team's goal is being scored into.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly handling the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the actions of catching and throwing the Quaffle, does not correctly determine which team scores a point, and does not update the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
