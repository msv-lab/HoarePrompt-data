#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of lines (N) in the field, where 3 <= N <= 99 and N is odd. b is a list of strings representing the field, where each string is a row of M pairs of characters separated by spaces, and M is the number of columns in the field, where 3 <= M <= 99 and M is odd. The list b has N elements. The next input is an integer T representing the number of steps in the game, where 0 <= T <= 10000. Following T lines are the actions performed by entities in the field, where each action is a string containing a pair of characters followed by a space and a valid action (U, D, L, R, C, or T) and possibly additional information for catch and throw actions.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns the result of `x + int(dx), y + int(dy)`, where `x` and `y` are integers, and `dx` and `dy` are the first and second strings in the list `b` respectively, converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer `a` and a list `b` as input. It returns a tuple representing the result of adding the integer values of the first and second elements of `b` to `x` and `y` respectively.
