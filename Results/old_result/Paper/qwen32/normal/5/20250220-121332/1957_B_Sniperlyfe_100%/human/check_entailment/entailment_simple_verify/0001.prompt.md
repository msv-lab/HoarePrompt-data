You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is 0 if enough iterations reduce `k` to 0, otherwise `k` retains the remaining value, `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `nums[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which they are 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, and `nums[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which they are 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
   - Their sum is `k`.
   - The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers is maximized.
2. The program should handle multiple test cases.

### Provided Program Explanation:
The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence. The function `func_1` initializes an array `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. It then sets the first element to the maximum number that can be represented with the number of bits needed to represent `k` minus one. It then distributes the remaining sum `k` among the elements of the array, ensuring that the sum of the array is exactly `k`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but with all bits set to 1 except the highest bit. This ensures that `nums[0]` has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation initially.
2. **Distribution**:
   - The remaining sum `k` is distributed among the rest of the elements in the array. The program ensures that the sum of the array is exactly `k`.
3. **Maximizing the Number of 1s**:
   - The initial choice of `nums[0]` ensures that it has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation. The distribution of the remaining sum `k` among the other elements does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, but it does ensure that the sum condition is met.

### Issues:
- The program does not guarantee that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s. For example, in the case where `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the program might output `3 2`, which has a bitwise OR of `3 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), but the optimal solution is `1 4` or `4 1`, which has a bitwise OR of `1 | 4 = 5` (binary `101`), having more 1s.
- The approach in the program does not consider the optimal distribution of bits among the elements to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not necessarily produce the correct sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
