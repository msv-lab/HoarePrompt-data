The code snippet `nums[0] += k` increments the value of `nums[0]` by `k`. Given the initial state, `nums[0]` is initially set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. After adding `k` to `nums[0]`, the new value of `nums[0]` becomes `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.

The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The values of `nums[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` also remain unchanged as they are only dependent on the initial value of `k` and not on the subsequent changes to `nums[0]`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, and `nums[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which they are 0.**
