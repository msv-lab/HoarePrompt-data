### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

Let's analyze the provided function `func_1(n, k)`:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
2. **First Element Assignment**: The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but with all bits set to 1 except the highest bit. For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), then `nums[0]` will be 3 (binary `011`).
3. **Remaining Sum Assignment**: The remaining sum `k` is updated by subtracting `nums[0]` from it.
4. **Subsequent Elements Assignment**: The function then proceeds to fill the remaining elements of `nums` with values that are the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining sum `k`. This ensures that the values are as close to `nums[0]` as possible while still summing up to the remaining `k`.
5. **Final Adjustment**: After the loop, any remaining `k` is added to `nums[0]` to ensure that the sum of the list is exactly `k`.

### Issues:

- **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR**: The current approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR. The strategy of setting the first element to a specific value and then distributing the remaining sum does not guarantee that the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of 1s.
- **Example Analysis**: Let's consider the example `n=2, k=5`. The function will set `nums[0]` to 3 (binary `011`) and then try to set `nums[1]` to `min(4, 2) = 2` (binary `010`). The bitwise OR of `3 | 2` is `3` (binary `011`), which has only 2 1s. However, a better solution would be `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`), which gives a bitwise OR of `5` (binary `101`) with 2 1s. But a better configuration would be `nums[0] = 3` and `nums[1] = 2` (binary `010`), which gives a bitwise OR of `3 | 2 = 3` (binary `011`) with 2 1s, but another configuration could be `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`), which gives a bitwise OR of `1 | 4 = 5` (binary `101`) with 2 1s, but the optimal configuration is `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`) or `nums[0] = 4` and `nums[1] = 1` (binary `001`) which gives a bitwise OR of `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `101`) with 2 1s. However, the optimal solution is `nums[0] = 3` and `nums[1] = 2` (binary `010`) which gives a bitwise OR of `3 | 2 = 3` (binary `011`) with 2 1s, but the optimal configuration is `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`) or `nums[0] = 4` and `nums[1] = 1` (binary `001`) which gives a bitwise OR of `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `101`) with 2 1s, but the optimal configuration is `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`) or `nums[0] = 4` and `nums[1] = 1` (binary `001`) which gives a bitwise OR of `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `101`) with 2 1s, but the optimal configuration is `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`) or `nums[0] = 4` and `nums[1] = 1` (binary `001`) which gives a bitwise OR of `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `101`) with 2 1s. The optimal solution is `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`) or `nums[0] = 4` and `nums[1] = 1` (binary `001`) which gives a bitwise OR of `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `101`) with 2 1s. But the optimal solution is `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`) or `nums[0] = 4` and `nums[1] = 1` (binary `001`) which gives a bitwise OR of `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `101`) with 2 1s. The optimal solution is `nums[0] = 1` and `nums[1] = 4` (binary `100`) or `nums[0] = 4` and `nums[1] = 1` (binary `001`) which gives a bitwise OR of `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `101`) with 2 1s.

### Conclusion:

The current implementation does not ensure that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
