The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. If `k` was greater than 0, `nums[2]` is 0 and the remaining elements of `nums` are 0, `i` is 3, and `k` retains its original value. Otherwise, `k` retains its original value and the remaining elements of `nums` are 0, `i` is 3**
