Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and the remaining elements are 0. The current value of `k` is greater than 0 after subtracting `((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)` from its initial value.**
