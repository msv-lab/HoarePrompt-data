### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Objective**: The program needs to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is `k` and whose bitwise OR maximizes the number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Program Strategy**:
   - The program initializes an array `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but with all bits set to 1. For example, if `k` is 5 (binary `101`), the value would be 3 (binary `011`).
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` and fills the remaining elements of the array with the smallest possible values that still sum up to the remaining `k`.
   - The last step adjusts the first element by adding the remaining `k` to it.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The approach aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the array. Setting the first element to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` ensures that the highest possible number of bits are set to 1 in the first element.
   - The remaining elements are filled with the smallest possible values, which minimizes their contribution to the bitwise OR operation, ensuring that the first element remains dominant in setting the 1s in the bitwise OR.
   - The final adjustment of the first element by adding the remaining `k` ensures that the sum of the array is exactly `k`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program ensures that the sum of the array is `k` by subtracting the value of the first element from `k` and distributing the remainder across the rest of the array.
   - The strategy of setting the first element to the largest possible value with the same number of bits as `k` and minimizing the contribution of the other elements helps in maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the array.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the strategy to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
