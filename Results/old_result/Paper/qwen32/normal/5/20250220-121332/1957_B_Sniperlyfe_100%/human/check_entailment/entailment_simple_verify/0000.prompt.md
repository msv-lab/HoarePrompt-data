You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `k` is 0 if enough iterations reduce `k` to 0, otherwise `k` retains the remaining value, `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `nums[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which they are 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where `nums[0]` is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`, and `nums[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` becomes 0, after which they are 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that:
  1. The sum of the sequence is `k`: \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = k\).
  2. The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized: `a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. The function `func_1` is supposed to construct the sequence that meets the conditions.

Here's the function `func_1` in detail:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums[0]` is set to the largest number with the same bit length as `k` but with all bits set to 1. This is achieved by `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
   - `k` is then reduced by `nums[0]`.

2. **Filling Remaining Elements**:
   - For each subsequent element in the sequence (from `nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]`), the value is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`.
   - `k` is reduced by the value assigned to the current element.

3. **Adjusting the First Element**:
   - After filling the remaining elements, the first element `nums[0]` is incremented by the remaining `k` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Maximizing the Number of 1s in Bitwise OR**:
  - The approach does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. For example, if `k` is a power of 2, the initial value of `nums[0]` will be `k - 1`, which might not be optimal.
  - The logic to set `nums[i]` to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` does not guarantee that the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of 1s.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The program will set `nums[0]` to `(1 << 2 - 1) - 1 = 1`, then `k` becomes `3 - 1 = 2`. It will then set `nums[1]` to `min(1 + 1, 2) = 2`, and finally `nums[0]` will be incremented by the remaining `k`, which is `0`. So the sequence will be `[1, 2]`. The bitwise OR of `1 | 2` is `3` which in binary is `11`, having 2 ones. However, a better sequence would be `[3, 0]` where the bitwise OR is `3` (binary `11`), but the sum is `3` and it has 2 ones as well. But if we consider `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the program will set `nums[0]` to `(1 << 3 - 1) - 1 = 7`, then `k` becomes `5 - 7 = -2` which is incorrect. The correct sequence should be `[3, 2]` where the bitwise OR is `3 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), having 2 ones, but a better sequence would be `[5, 0]` where the bitwise OR is `5` (binary `101`), having 2 ones but a better sequence would be `[3, 2]` where the bitwise OR is `3 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), having 2 ones but a better sequence would be `[4, 1]` where the bitwise OR is `4 | 1 = 5` (binary `101`), having 3 ones.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not always maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence, and it can produce incorrect sequences for certain inputs.

**Correctness: False**. 

Explanation: The program does not guarantee that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s, as demonstrated by the counterexample.
