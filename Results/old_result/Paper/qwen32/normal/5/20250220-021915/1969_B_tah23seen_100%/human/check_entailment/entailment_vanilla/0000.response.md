To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the given solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s should come before all 1s) by performing cyclic shifts on any substring of the string. Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring being shifted. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted string.

### Key Observations

1. **Sorting Requirement**: In a binary string, sorting in non-descending order means all 0s should be at the beginning, followed by all 1s.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of a cyclic shift operation is the length of the substring being shifted. To minimize the total cost, we need to carefully choose the substrings to shift.
3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy involves shifting substrings in such a way that each '0' that is encountered after a '1' can be moved to the left of the first '1' it encounters. This is because moving a '0' past a '1' requires a shift operation, and the cost of this operation is minimized by shifting the smallest possible substring that includes both the '0' and the '1'.

### Solution Analysis

Let's analyze the provided solution in detail:

```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost
```

- **Initialization**: We initialize `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0. `cost` will store the total cost, and `one` will count the number of '1's encountered so far.
- **Iteration**: We iterate through each character in the string `s`.
  - If the character is '1', we increment the `one` counter.
  - If the character is '0' and `one` is greater than 0 (indicating that we have encountered at least one '1' before this '0'), we add `one + 1` to the `cost`. This is because the '0' needs to be moved past all the '1's encountered so far, and the cost of this operation is `one + 1` (the length of the substring that includes all the '1's and the '0').

### Correctness Verification

The provided solution correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by considering the optimal strategy of moving each '0' past the '1's it encounters. The cost calculation `one + 1` is appropriate because it accounts for the length of the substring that needs to be shifted to move the '0' past all the '1's.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

**Correctness: True**
