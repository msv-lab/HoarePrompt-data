### Reasoning:
The provided program is attempting to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in the program seems flawed.

The program iterates through the string and counts the number of consecutive '1's (`one`). When it encounters a '0' after a sequence of '1's, it adds `one + 1` to the cost. This logic does not correctly account for the minimum cost to sort the string.

To understand why, consider the example `101011`:
- The program would count the first '1' and then see a '0', adding `1 + 1 = 2` to the cost.
- It then counts the next '1' and sees another '0', adding `1 + 1 = 2` to the cost.
- It then counts the next two '1's and sees a '0', adding `2 + 1 = 3` to the cost.
- Total cost: `2 + 2 + 3 = 7`.

However, the correct minimum cost to sort `101011` is `5`, as described in the problem statement:
- Shift substring `[1, 3]`: `101011` → `011011` (cost: 3)
- Shift substring `[2, 4]`: `011011` → `001111` (cost: 3)
- Total cost: `3 + 2 = 5`.

The logic in the program does not correctly identify the optimal sequence of operations to sort the string with the minimum cost. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
