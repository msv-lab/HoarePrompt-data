Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the allowed operations. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the most efficient way to perform the cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted string.

To correctly solve the problem, the algorithm should consider the optimal way to move all '1's to the right and all '0's to the left. The cost calculation should reflect the minimal operations required to achieve this, which involves more complex logic than what is currently implemented in `func_1`.

Here is a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. Count the number of '1's encountered so far.
2. For each '0' encountered after the first '1', calculate the cost of moving all the '1's encountered so far to the right of this '0'.
3. Accumulate these costs to get the total minimum cost.

However, the implementation provided does not correctly handle the cost calculation for all scenarios, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.
