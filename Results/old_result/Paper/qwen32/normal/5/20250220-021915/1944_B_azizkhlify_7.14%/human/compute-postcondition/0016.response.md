The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n, 2 * n):`, which means the only variable that can be adjusted for the next iteration is `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, as the `range` function in Python generates numbers starting from the first argument up to, but not including, the second argument.

Thus, `i` should be `n + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` zeros except `r[a[n] - 1]` which is 1; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `n + 1`**
