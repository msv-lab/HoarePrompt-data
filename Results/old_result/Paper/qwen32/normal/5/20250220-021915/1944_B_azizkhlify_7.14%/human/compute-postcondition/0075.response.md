To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's analyze the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Variables and their definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `k`: Defined as `2 * k - ul`, where `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2.
   - `a`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `l`: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
   - `r`: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
   - `ul`: The total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2.
   - `ur`: Set to 0.
   - `i`: The next element of `res` after the current `i`.
   - `res`: A list with at least two elements.
   - `re`: The count of elements in `a` that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration, if `k` is not zero. Otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged.

2. **Key Points:**
   - The exact values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ul`, `l`, `r`, `res`, and `re` are not provided, so we can't compute their exact numerical values.
   - `k` is defined in terms of `ul`, but we don't have the value of `ul` to compute `k`.
   - `i` is described as the next element of `res` after the current `i`, but we don't know the current `i` or the contents of `res`.

3. **Output Analysis:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (because of `end=' '`).
   - Since `i` is described as the next element of `res` after the current `i`, and we don't have the exact value of `i` or the contents of `res`, we can't determine its exact numerical value.

Given the information, the most precise description of what will be printed is that it will be the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **i (where i is the next element of res after the current i)**
