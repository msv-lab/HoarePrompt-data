Postcondition: **`i` is the last element of `res`, `res` remains unchanged, `re` remains unchanged, `ul` and `ur` are not equal unless `ul` equals `ur` after the if condition is checked, `k` and other variables remain unchanged, `n` is at least 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, then `ul` is equal to `ur`. Otherwise, `ul` and `ur` remain not equal.**
