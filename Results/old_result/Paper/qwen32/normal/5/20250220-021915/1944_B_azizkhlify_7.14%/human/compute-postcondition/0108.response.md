The code snippet `res = []` initializes the list `res` to be an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input; `k` is the second integer from the input; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `k` is not zero if `ul` != `ur`; `re` is 0.**
