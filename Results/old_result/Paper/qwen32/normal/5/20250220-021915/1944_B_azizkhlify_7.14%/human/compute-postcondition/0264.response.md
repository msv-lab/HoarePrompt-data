The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `1`, and `n` is greater than `1`. For the next iteration, `i` will be increased by `1`.

State: **`i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `2`, `l[a[0] - 1]` is `1`. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, `re` is increased by `1` and `res` contains `a[1]`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `re` or `res`.**
