Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `t`: An integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (This variable seems to be related to the number of test cases but is not directly relevant to the print statement).
   - `n`: An integer greater than 0 (This variable represents the length of the sublist `a[n:2 * n]` and the size of lists `l` and `r`).
   - `k`: Calculated as `2 * k - ul`. However, the formula seems incorrect as it refers to `k` on both sides. Assuming `k` is initially defined before this calculation.
   - `a`: A list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `l`: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`.
   - `r`: A list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
   - `ul`: The total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2.
   - `ur`: Initialized to 0.
   - `i`: The first element of the list `res`.
   - `res`: A list with at least one element.
   - `re`: If `k` is not zero, `re` is the count of elements in `a` that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration. Otherwise, `re` is not modified.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(i, end=' ')`: This statement prints the value of `i` followed by a space.

### Determining the Output

From the initial state, the only variable directly relevant to the print statement is `i`. The variable `i` is defined as the first element of the list `res`.

Since the exact contents of the list `res` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the first element of `res`.

### Final Output

Output: **i (where i is the first element of the list res)**
