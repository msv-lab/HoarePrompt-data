The `break` statement will terminate the nearest enclosing loop (such as a `for` or `while` loop) but will not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `k`, `n`, and `a` will remain unchanged. The condition that `ul` is equal to `ur` and the condition that `ur` is increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2 also remain as they were before the `break` statement, as the `break` does not execute any further code in the loop.

Output State: **`i` is the last element of `res`, `res` remains unchanged, `re` remains unchanged, `ul` and `ur` are not equal, `k` and other variables remain unchanged, `n` is at least 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Additionally, `ul` is equal to `ur`.**
