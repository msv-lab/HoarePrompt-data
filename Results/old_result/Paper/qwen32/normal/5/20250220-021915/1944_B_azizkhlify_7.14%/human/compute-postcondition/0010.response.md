The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. Given the initial state, the list `l` has `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 1. After the increment, `l[a[i] - 1]` will be 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` must be greater than 0; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 2; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 1**.
