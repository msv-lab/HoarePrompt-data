Postcondition: **`i` is n-1, `n` is greater than 0, `res` is [], `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 * n, `ur` is 0, `k` is a non-zero integer (since the condition `if (k)` is true, `k` cannot be 0), `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list of length n with the element at index a[0] - 1 incremented by 1, the element at index a[1] - 1 incremented by 1, ..., and the element at index a[n-1] - 1 incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length n with the element at index a[i] - 1 incremented by 1 for each i from n to 2 * n - 1.**
