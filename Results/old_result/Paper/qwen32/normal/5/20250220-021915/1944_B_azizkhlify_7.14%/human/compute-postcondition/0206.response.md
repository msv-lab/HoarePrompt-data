The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The other variables (`i`, `res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is either `2 * n - 1` or the value at which `ul` equals `ur`; `res` remains unchanged; `re` remains unchanged; `ul` and `ur` are either not equal or equal at the point the loop breaks; `k` and other variables remain unchanged; `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
