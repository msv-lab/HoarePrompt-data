To determine the output of the print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Key Points from Initial State:
1. `a` is a list of integers.
2. `i` is set to `n`.
3. The current element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is 2.

### Understanding `a[i]`:
- `i` is given as `n`.
- Therefore, `a[i]` is `a[n]`.

### Understanding `r[a[i] - 1]`:
- `r` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is given as 2, meaning the count of occurrences of `a[n]` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]` is 2.

### Conclusion:
- Since `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it implies that the element `a[n]` appears exactly twice in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`.
- Therefore, `a[i]` (which is `a[n]`) is printed twice in the output.

### Output:
The print statement will print the value of `a[n]` twice, separated by a space, and no newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

Output: **a[n], a[n] (where a[n] is the element at index n in the list a)**
