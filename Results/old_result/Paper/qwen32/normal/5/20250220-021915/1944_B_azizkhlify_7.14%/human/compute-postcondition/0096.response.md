Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is 2 * k - ul; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`; `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2; `ur` is either 0 or 2; `i` is `n + 2`; `res` is an empty list; `k` is not zero; `re` is the count of elements in `a` that appear exactly once, up to the n-th iteration; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain unchanged except that the program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
