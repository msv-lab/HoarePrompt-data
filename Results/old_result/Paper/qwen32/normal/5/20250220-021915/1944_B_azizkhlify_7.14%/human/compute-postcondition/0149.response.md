The code snippet `re += 1` increments the value of the variable `re` by 1. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `re`, so we assume it has some integer value before the increment. After the increment, `re` will be that initial value plus 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `l[a[i] - 1]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1; `re` is increased by 1.**
