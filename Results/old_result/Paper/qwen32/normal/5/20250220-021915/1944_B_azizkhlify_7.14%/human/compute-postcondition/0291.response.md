To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's analyze the given information step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- All elements of `res` have been printed.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- The state of other variables remains unchanged.
- If `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is increased by 2.
- If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is instructed to print two values: `a[i]` and `a[i]`, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end (`end=' '`).
- Given that the state of `i` is `i + 1`, this implies that `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous state.
- The value `a[i]` will be printed twice in the output.

### Output Description:
- The exact value of `a[i]` cannot be determined without knowing the specific contents of the list `a` and the current value of `i`.
- However, we can describe the output in terms of the current state of `a` and `i`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
