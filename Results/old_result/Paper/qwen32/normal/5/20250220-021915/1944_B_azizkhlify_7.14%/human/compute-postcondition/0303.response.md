Postcondition: **All elements of `res` have been printed, and the state of other variables remains unchanged except for `ur`, which may have been incremented by 2 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. The loop terminates either after completing `n` iterations or when `ul` equals `ur`. If `ul` was not equal to `ur` initially, the loop has executed `n` times (or fewer if `ul` equals `ur` during an iteration).**
