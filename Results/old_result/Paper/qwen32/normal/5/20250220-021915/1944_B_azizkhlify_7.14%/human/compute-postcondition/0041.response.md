To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables involved. The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it checks if the count of the current element in the list `l` is 2. If it is, it prints the element twice and increments `ul` by 2. The loop breaks if `ul` equals `k * 2`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
   - `n`: an integer greater than 0
   - `k`: an integer obtained from the input
   - `a`: a list of integers obtained from the input
   - `l`: a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`
   - `r`: a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`
   - `re`: 0
   - `ul`: 0
   - `ur`: 0
   - `res`: an empty list
   - `i`: `2 * n - 1`

2. **Loop Iterations:**
   - The loop runs `n` times.
   - In each iteration, it checks if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
   - If true, it prints `a[i]` twice and increments `ul` by 2.
   - The loop breaks if `ul == k * 2`.

3. **Output State after All Iterations:**
   - The loop will run `n` times unless it breaks early due to `ul` reaching `k * 2`.
   - The value of `ul` will be the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2.
   - The value of `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes all `n` iterations (since the loop variable `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`).
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `a`; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of occurrences of `j + 1` in the sublist `a[n:2 * n]`; `re` is 0; `ul` is the total count of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is `n - 1`.**

In simple terms, after the loop completes, `ul` will reflect the total number of elements that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, multiplied by 2. The loop counter `i` will be `n-1`, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
