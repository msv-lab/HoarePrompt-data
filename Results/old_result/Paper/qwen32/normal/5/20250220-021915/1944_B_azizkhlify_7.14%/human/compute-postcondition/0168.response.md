Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, then `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` contains the element `a[i]` appended to it. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the loop or statement continues as per the original conditions.**
