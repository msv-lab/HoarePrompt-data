The code snippet `re += 1` increments the value of the variable `re` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `re`, we can only state that it has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `re` is incremented by 1.**
