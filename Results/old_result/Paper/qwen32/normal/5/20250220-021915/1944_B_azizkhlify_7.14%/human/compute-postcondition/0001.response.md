The provided Python code reads a single line of input and splits it into two integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.**
