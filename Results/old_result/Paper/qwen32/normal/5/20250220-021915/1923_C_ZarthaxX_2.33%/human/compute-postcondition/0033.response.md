The code snippet provided only updates the value of `sumInRange`. It recalculates `sumInRange` as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 0 <= q <= 3 * 10^5, `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in the first `i-1` elements of `nums`, `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `nums` minus `i-1`, `i` is `n`, `l` and `r` are the two integers read from the input, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` equals `r`, no further changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` determines whether the if part or the else part is executed. If this condition holds true, the if part is executed, and if it does not hold true, the else part is executed, indicating that the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange` is true.**

In simple terms: The value of `sumInRange` has been recalculated to be `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
