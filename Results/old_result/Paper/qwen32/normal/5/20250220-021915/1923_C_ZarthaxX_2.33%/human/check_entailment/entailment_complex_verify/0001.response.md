### Reasoning:

Let's carefully evaluate the provided solution and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Breakdown

The problem requires determining if a subarray can be transformed into another array `b` such that:
1. The sum of the subarray equals the sum of `b`.
2. Each element in the subarray is different from the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` are positive.

#### Key Observations

- If a subarray consists entirely of `1`s, it cannot be transformed into another array `b` where all elements are different from `1` and positive.
- For a subarray to be "good", the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements should be sufficient to accommodate the transformation into `b` while ensuring all elements are different and positive.

#### Solution Analysis

The solution constructs two prefix arrays:
1. `ones[i]`: Counts the number of `1`s in the subarray from the start up to index `i-1`.
2. `sum[i]`: Computes the sum of the subarray from the start up to index `i-1` and subtracts the number of elements in that range.

For each query, the program:
- Computes the number of `1`s in the subarray (`onesInRange`).
- Computes the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements (`sumInRange`).
- Checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds.

Let's simplify the condition:
- `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1)`.
- This condition checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is at least the count of `1`s plus the length of the subarray. This ensures that there is enough "space" to adjust the elements to form `b` without violating the conditions.

#### Verification of the Condition

The condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` ensures that:
- If there are `onesInRange` number of `1`s, they need to be changed to different positive integers.
- The remaining elements in the subarray need to be adjusted to ensure all elements in `b` are different and positive.
- The sum of the subarray minus the number of elements (`sumInRange`) should be sufficient to accommodate these changes.

### Annotations and State Analysis

The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
- `ones[i]` correctly counts the number of `1`s up to index `i-1`.
- `sum[i]` correctly computes the sum of the subarray up to index `i-1` minus the number of elements.
- The condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` is correctly applied to determine if the subarray can be transformed into `b`.

### Conclusion

Based on the problem analysis, key observations, solution analysis, and the verification of the condition, the provided solution correctly determines if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions.
