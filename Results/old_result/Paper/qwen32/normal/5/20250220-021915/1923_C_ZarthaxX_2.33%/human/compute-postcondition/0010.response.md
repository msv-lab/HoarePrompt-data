The only variable in the loop head of the provided `for` loop is `i`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` accordingly.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should have `i` equal to 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input; `ones` is a list of n + 1 integers where `ones[1]` is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, else `ones[1]` is 0; `ones[2]` is `ones[1] + (1 if nums[1] == 1 else 0)`; `sum` is a list of n + 1 integers where `sum[1]` is `nums[0] - 1` and `sum[2]` is `(nums[0] - 1) + nums[1] - 1`; `i` is 3**
