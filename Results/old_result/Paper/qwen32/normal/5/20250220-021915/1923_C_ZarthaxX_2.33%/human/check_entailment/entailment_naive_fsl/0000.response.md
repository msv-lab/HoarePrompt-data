Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Specifically, the logic used to determine the goodness of a subarray is flawed.

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Condition 1**: The sum of the subarray `a` should be equal to the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. **Condition 2**: Each element `a_i` should not be equal to the corresponding element `b_i`.
3. **Condition 3**: Each element `b_i` should be greater than 0.

### Provided Solution Analysis:
The provided solution uses two auxiliary arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to determine the goodness of a subarray. Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- `ones[i]` keeps track of the number of 1s up to the i-th element.
- `sum[i]` keeps track of the sum of the subarray up to the i-th element minus the number of elements in the subarray.

The core logic for determining if a subarray is good is:
```python
if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
This logic seems to be an attempt to check if we can construct array `b` such that it satisfies all the conditions. However, there are several issues with this logic:
1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The `sum` array is calculated as `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`, which does not correctly represent the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements.
2. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` does not correctly check if we can construct array `b` that satisfies all the conditions.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
5 1
2 2 2 2 2
1 5
```
The subarray is `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`. The sum of this subarray is `10`. To satisfy the conditions, we need to construct array `b` such that:
- `sum(b) = 10`
- `b_i != 2` for all `i`
- `b_i > 0` for all `i`

One possible array `b` could be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 6]`, which satisfies all the conditions. However, the provided program will incorrectly determine this subarray as not good.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the goodness of subarrays in all cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
