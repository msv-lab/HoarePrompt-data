The `print('NO')` statement in the provided code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, and `r` as described in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'NO'`.
2. None of the variables mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, `r`) are used within the `print` statement.
3. The value of `l` being equal to `r` does not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Given the above points, the output of the `print` statement will always be `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
