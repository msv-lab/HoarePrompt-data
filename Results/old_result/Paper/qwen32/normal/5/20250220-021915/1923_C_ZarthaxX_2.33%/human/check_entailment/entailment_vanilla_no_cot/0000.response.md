Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
An array is considered "good" if there exists another array of the same length such that:
1. The sum of the elements in both arrays is equal.
2. No element in the arrays is the same at any index.
3. All elements in the second array are greater than 0.

### Solution Analysis:
The program attempts to determine if a given subarray is "good" by using prefix sums and counting the number of ones in the subarray. However, the logic seems flawed.

### Program Logic:
1. **Prefix Sums Calculation:**
   - `ones[i]` keeps track of the number of ones up to index `i`.
   - `sum[i]` keeps track of the sum of elements up to index `i`, minus the number of elements (since each element in the subarray `b` must be at least 1).

2. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, it calculates the number of ones in the subarray and the adjusted sum.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is checked to determine if the subarray is "good".

### Flaw in Logic:
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` does not correctly determine if a subarray can be transformed into another array meeting the problem's requirements.
- The program does not account for the fact that each element in `b` must be different from the corresponding element in `a` and that the sum of elements in `b` must equal the sum of elements in `a`.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve checking if there is a way to construct array `b` such that:
- `b[i] != a[i]` for all `i`.
- `b[i] > 0` for all `i`.
- The sum of `b` equals the sum of `a`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
