Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to determine if a given subarray is "good" based on the following conditions:

1. The sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of another array `b` of the same length.
2. No element in the subarray should be equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
3. All elements in `b` should be positive.

### Key Observations

For a subarray to be "good":
- The sum of the subarray `c[l:r+1]` should be equal to the sum of `b`, which can be any positive integers different from `c[l:r+1]`.
- To ensure that `a_i != b_i` for every index `i`, we need at least one element in `c[l:r+1]` to be different from `b_i`. This implies that the subarray should not consist of all `1`s because if all elements are `1`, we cannot create `b` with all positive integers different from `1`.
- The condition `b_i > 0` is inherently satisfied as long as we ensure `b_i != a_i`.

### Solution Analysis

Let's analyze the provided solution:

1. **Prefix Arrays Construction:**
   - `ones[i]` keeps the count of `1`s up to index `i` in the array.
   - `sum[i]` keeps the sum of the array up to index `i` minus the number of elements in that range (since we subtract `1` for each element).

2. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of `1`s in the subarray and the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray can be "good". This condition essentially checks if we can construct an array `b` that meets the criteria.

### Correctness of the Solution

Let's verify if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is correct:

- `onesInRange` is the count of `1`s in the subarray.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements.
- `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1)`.
- This condition checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements is at least the count of `1`s plus the length of the subarray. This ensures that there is enough "space" to adjust the elements to form `b` without violating the conditions.

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The condition used in the solution is derived from the requirement that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that meets the criteria.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
