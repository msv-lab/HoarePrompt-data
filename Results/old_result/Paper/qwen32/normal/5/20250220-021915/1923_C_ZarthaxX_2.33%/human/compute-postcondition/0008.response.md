Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of n integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input; `ones` is a list of n + 1 integers where `ones[1]` is 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, else `ones[1]` is 0; `ones[2]` is `ones[1] + (1 if nums[1] == 1 else 0)`; `sum` is a list of n + 1 integers where `sum[1]` is `nums[0] - 1` and other elements are 0; `i` is 2**.

In simple terms, the value of `ones[2]` is updated to be the value of `ones[1]` plus 1 if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as `ones[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
