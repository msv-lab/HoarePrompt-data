The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state and the conditions described do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement directly. The print statement is executed regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `l`, `r`, `onesInRange`, and `sumInRange`, and the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` does not affect the execution of this print statement.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
