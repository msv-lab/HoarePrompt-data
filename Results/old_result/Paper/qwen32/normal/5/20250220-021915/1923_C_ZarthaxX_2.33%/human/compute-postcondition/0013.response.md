Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 3 * 10^5; `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and 1 <= c_i <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of integers derived from the input; `ones` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `ones[i]` is the count of 1s in the first `i-1` elements of `nums`; `sum` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `sum[i]` is the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `nums` minus `i-1`; `i` is `n`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `ones[i]` will hold the number of 1s encountered in the first `i-1` elements of `nums`, and `sum[i]` will hold the sum of the first `i-1` elements of `nums` minus the count of those elements. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n` at the end, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
