Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of elements in a list `c`, an integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list `c` of `n` integers. For each query, which is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, the function performs an operation (not specified in the provided details) on the sublist of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive). The function returns the result of each query.**
