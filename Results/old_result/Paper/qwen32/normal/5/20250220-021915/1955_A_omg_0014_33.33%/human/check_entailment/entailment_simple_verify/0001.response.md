### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotations to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts. We have two options:
1. Buy each yogurt individually at a price of `a` burles.
2. Buy two yogurts at a promotional price of `b` burles.

The goal is to minimize the total cost.

#### Program Analysis
Here is the provided program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

And the annotations describe the state of the program at key points.

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Variable Misuse**: The program expects three integers `(a, b, c)`, but the problem statement describes the inputs as `(n, a, b)`. Here, `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The variable `c` is not used correctly and should be `b`.
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price.
3. **Comparison Logic**: The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually (`n * a`) and the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs at the promotional price plus the cost of any remaining yogurt (`(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`).

#### Correct Implementation
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts individually
        individual_cost = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotional price
        pair_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(individual_cost, pair_cost))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to the misuse of variables and incorrect logic for calculating the minimum cost. The annotations highlight the issues with variable misuse and the incorrect comparison logic but do not fully address the need to calculate the cost of buying pairs correctly.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
