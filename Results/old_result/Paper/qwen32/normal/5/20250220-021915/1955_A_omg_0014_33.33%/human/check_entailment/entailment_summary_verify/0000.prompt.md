You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * (c / 2))`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * (c / 2)`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value, as its output is through print statements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given problem description. Let's analyze why it is incorrect:

1. The input parsing is incorrect. The problem states that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line contains three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, the code reads the first integer as `n` (number of test cases) and then tries to parse the next three integers as `a`, `b`, and `c`. This will lead to errors because `c` is not defined in the problem description and `b` is incorrectly used in the calculations.

2. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The code attempts to calculate the cost by comparing `a * b` and `a * d`, where `d` is `c / 2`. However, this does not correctly account for the promotion price `b` for two yogurts.

3. The program does not handle the case where buying yogurts in pairs is more cost-effective than buying them individually. For example, if `n` is odd, the program should buy `(n // 2)` pairs and one individual yogurt, or `(n // 2)` pairs if `n` is even.

Let's consider a test case to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
15
```

The program incorrectly calculates the cost as `15` instead of `14` because it does not correctly handle the promotion price for buying two yogurts.

To fix the program, it should correctly read the inputs and calculate the minimum cost based on the promotion price for two yogurts. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs and the remaining yogurt
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected version reads the inputs correctly and calculates the minimum cost by considering the promotion price for two yogurts and the cost for any remaining yogurt.
