The code snippet `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state mentions that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input, and `d` is `c / 2`. The value of `d` will be updated based on the new value of `c` after the input is read.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided by the input, they will change based on what is input. The value of `d` will be recalculated as `c / 2` using the new value of `c`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 4; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input; `d` is `c / 2`; `i` is 4**
