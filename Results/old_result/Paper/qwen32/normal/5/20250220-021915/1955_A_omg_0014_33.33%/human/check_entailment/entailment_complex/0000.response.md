### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the prices `a` (for one yogurt) and `b` (for two yogurts under promotion).

However, there are a few issues in the provided code that need to be addressed:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage:**
   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used in the input, but the problem statement specifies that the input consists of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `c` does not exist in the problem description and seems to be a misinterpretation of the input variables.
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, but `c` is not defined in the problem context. It seems like `b` should be used instead of `c` for the promotion price.

2. **Logic Error:**
   - The comparison `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. The correct comparison should be based on whether buying yogurts in pairs (using the promotion) is cheaper than buying them individually.
   - The logic should be comparing `b` (price for two yogurts) with `2 * a` (price for two yogurts bought individually). If `b < 2 * a`, it is cheaper to buy in pairs. Otherwise, buy individually.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Cost:**
   - The code should calculate the number of pairs (`n // 2`) and the remaining yogurts (`n % 2`), then compute the cost based on the promotion price for pairs and the individual price for any remaining yogurt.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of pairs and remaining yogurts
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        
        # Calculate the minimum cost
        min_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        
        print(min_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the original code, the program as provided is incorrect. The corrected version fixes these issues and should work as intended.

**Correctness: False**
