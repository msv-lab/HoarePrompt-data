The value of `prod` is updated to be the product of its previous value and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, and `vals` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `k` is a list of `n` integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least two elements; `prod` is the product of its previous value and `r`; `r` is the next element in `vals`.**
