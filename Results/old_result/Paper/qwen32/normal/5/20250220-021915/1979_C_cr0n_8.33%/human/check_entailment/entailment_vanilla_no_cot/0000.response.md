Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then distributes the bets based on the product divided by each multiplier, but it does not guarantee that the total bet is less than the received amount for each outcome.

To solve the problem correctly, you can use a different approach. One possible solution is to assign bets such that the total amount bet is less than the received amount for each outcome. A simple and effective strategy is to bet 1 coin on the outcome with the highest multiplier and distribute the remaining bets in a way that satisfies the conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
cases = int(input())
for _ in range(cases):
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    max_k = max(vals)
    bets = [1 if k == max_k else k - 1 for k in vals]
    total_bet = sum(bets)
    valid = all(k * x > total_bet for k, x in zip(vals, bets))
    if valid:
        print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

In this corrected version, we bet 1 coin on the outcome with the highest multiplier and bet `k-1` coins on the other outcomes. This ensures that the total bet is less than the received amount for each outcome. If the total bet is not valid for any outcome, we print `-1`.
