Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `k` is a list of `n` integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `N` is an input integer; `vals` is a list of integers derived from the input; `prod` is 1.**

In this output state, the variable `prod` has been initialized to 1, while all other variables retain their initial states as described.
