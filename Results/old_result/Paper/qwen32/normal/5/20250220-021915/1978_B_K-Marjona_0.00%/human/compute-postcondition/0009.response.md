The code snippet assigns values to `n`, `a`, and `b` based on the input. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` are mentioned in the initial state, but only `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated by the code. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged, and the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are taken from the input.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are the values provided by the input; `k` remains unchanged.**
