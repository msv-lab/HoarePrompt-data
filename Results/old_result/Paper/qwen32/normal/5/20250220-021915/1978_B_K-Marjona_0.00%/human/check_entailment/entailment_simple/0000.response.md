### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - The first `k` buns can be sold at a modified price, where the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins.
   - The goal is to find the maximum profit Bob can make by selling all `n` buns.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `b <= a`, it's better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price is not beneficial.
   - If `b > a`, we need to find the optimal `k` to maximize profit.
   - The maximum `k` can be `min(n, b - a + 1)` because beyond this, the price `(b - i + 1)` becomes non-positive.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - For `k` buns sold at modified prices, the total price is the sum of an arithmetic series: `b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1)`.
   - The sum of this arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series: `((b + (b - k + 1)) * k) // 2`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, so the total price for these is `(n - k) * a`.
   - Therefore, the total profit is `((b + (b - k + 1)) * k) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies the optimal `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - It handles the case where `b <= a` by directly printing `a * n`.
   - For `b > a`, it calculates the profit using the derived formula and prints it.

5. **Verification with Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases are correctly handled by the program, producing the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns under the given conditions.

**Correctness: True**
