Let's break down the given code snippet and initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (This is a bit confusing as `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for the purpose of this task).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are values provided by the input.
- `k` is `min(n, b - a)`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Calculate `k`**:
   - `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
   - This means `k = min(n, b - a)`.

2. **Calculate the first part of the expression**:
   - `b + (b - k + 1)`:
     - This can be simplified to `2b - k + 1`.
   - `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2`:
     - This is equivalent to `(2b - k + 1) // 2`.
     - This part calculates the average of the sequence from `b - k + 1` to `b` and then takes the integer part of it.
   - `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`:
     - This multiplies the average by `k`.

3. **Calculate the second part of the expression**:
   - `(n - k) * a`:
     - This multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by `a`.

4. **Combine the two parts**:
   - The final expression is `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`.

### Final Output:
The final printed value is the sum of two parts:
- The first part is the sum of the sequence from `b - k + 1` to `b` (inclusive), scaled by `k`.
- The second part is the product of the remaining count `(n - k)` and the value `a`.

Given the above breakdown, the output can be described as:
Output: **The sum of the sequence from `b - k + 1` to `b` scaled by `k`, plus the product of `(n - k)` and `a` (where `k = min(n, b - a)`)**.
