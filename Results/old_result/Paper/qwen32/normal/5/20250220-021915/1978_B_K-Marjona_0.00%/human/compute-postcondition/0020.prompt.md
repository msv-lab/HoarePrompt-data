Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). Each of the following t test cases consists of three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = min(n, b - a)
    if b <= a:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4); `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `b` remains less than or equal to `a`. Otherwise, `b` is greater than `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`; `n`, `a`, and `b` are the values provided by the input; `k` is `min(n, b - a)`. Regardless of whether `b <= a` or not, `t` is decremented by 1, and `k` remains as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are the values provided by the input, and `k` is `min(n, b - a)`. The value of `k` remains unchanged regardless of whether `b <= a` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
