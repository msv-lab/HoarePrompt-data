### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the code and the annotated version to ensure that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Case 1: `b <= a`**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - The code correctly handles this case by printing `a * n`.

2. **Case 2: `b > a`**
   - The goal is to maximize profit by choosing an optimal `k` such that the first `k` buns are sold at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The code sets `k = min(n, b - a)`. This is a reasonable approach since selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would not be beneficial because the price would drop to zero or below.
   - The formula for the profit when `b > a` is `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`. This formula calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **Line 3:** `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())`
  - Correctly reads the input values for `n`, `a`, and `b`.
  
- **Line 5:** `k = min(n, b - a)`
  - This line ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the maximum number of buns that can be sold at a positive modified price `b - a`.
  
- **Line 7:** `if b <= a:`
  - Correctly handles the case where the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price.
  
- **Line 8:** `print(a * n)`
  - Correctly prints the total profit when all buns are sold at the usual price.
  
- **Line 10:** `else:`
  - Correctly handles the case where the modified price is greater than the usual price.
  
- **Line 11:** `print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)`
  - This line calculates the total profit by summing the arithmetic series for the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and adding the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.
  - The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` correctly calculates the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`.

#### Testing with Examples:
Let's verify the code output against the provided examples:

1. **Input:** `4 4 5`

   - Code Output: `35` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `10 10 5`
   - Expected Output: `100`
   - Calculation: `10 * 10 = 100`
   - Code Output: `100` (Correct)

4. **Input:** `5 5 11`
   - Expected Output: `45`
   - Calculation: `11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45`
   - Code Output: `45` (Correct)

5. **Input:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Expected Output: `1000000000000000000`
   - Calculation: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Code Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

6. **Input:** `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Expected Output: `1000000000000000000`
   - Calculation: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
   - Code Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

7. **Input:** `1000 1 1000`
   - Expected Output: `500500`
   - Calculation: `1000 + 999 + ... + 2 + 1 = 500500`
   - Code Output: `500500` (Correct)
