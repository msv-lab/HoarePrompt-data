To determine the output of the `print(a * n)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is set to `t - 1`. However, `t` is not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are values provided by the input.
   - `k` is calculated as `min(n, b - a)`. However, `k` is also not used in the provided print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - The print statement is `print(a * n)`.

Given the above information, the output will be the product of `a` and `n`. Since `a` and `n` are provided by the input, we can express the output as the product of these two input values.

### Explanation:
- `a` is a value provided by the input.
- `n` is a value provided by the input.
- The expression `a * n` computes the product of `a` and `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a * n (where a and n are the values provided by the input)**
