The initial state describes several variables: `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'PEAK'` and does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the output will be the exact string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
