You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` each ranging from 0 to 9. For each test case, the function prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three integers, and 'NONE' otherwise.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic for Determining "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE":**
   - **STAIR**: The condition `a < b < c` is checked. If true, it prints "STAIR".
   - **PEAK**: The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is used to check if `b` is the maximum among the three numbers, which implies `a < b > c`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
   - **NONE**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

3. **Special Case Consideration:**
   - The program also checks `a == b == c` explicitly and prints "NONE". However, this condition is already covered by the "ELSE" clause since `a == b == c` will not satisfy either `a < b < c` or `max(a, b, c) == b`.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the conditions, the program outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case.

### Issues:
- The condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary because if `a == b == c`, neither `a < b < c` nor `max(a, b, c) == b` will be true, and the "NONE" will be printed anyway.
- The logic for determining "PEAK" is correct, but it can be simplified by directly checking `a < b > c` instead of using `max(a, b, c) == b`.

### Conclusion:
The program is functionally correct in terms of the logic used to determine whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. However, it includes an unnecessary condition check, which does not affect the correctness but can be simplified.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
