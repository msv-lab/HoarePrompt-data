### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic for Determining "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE":**
   - **STAIR**: The condition `a < b < c` is checked. If true, it prints "STAIR". This condition is correct according to the problem description.
   - **PEAK**: The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is used to check if `b` is the maximum among the three numbers. This implies that `a < b > c`, which is the definition of a peak. This condition is also correct.
   - **NONE**: If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE". This correctly handles all other cases.

3. **Special Case Consideration:**
   - The program includes the condition `elif a == b == c:` to explicitly check for the case where all three digits are equal. This condition is unnecessary because if `a == b == c`, neither `a < b < c` nor `max(a, b, c) == b` will be true, and the "NONE" will be printed anyway. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

4. **Output:**
   - Based on the conditions, the program outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case, which matches the problem description.

### Issues:
- The condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary, as mentioned. However, it does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is functionally correct. It accurately determines whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
