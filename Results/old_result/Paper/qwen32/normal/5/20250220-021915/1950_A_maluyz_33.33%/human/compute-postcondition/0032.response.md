Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `i` is 2, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers provided by the input. If `a` equals `b` equals `c`, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
