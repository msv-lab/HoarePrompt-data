Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements in an array equal using at most one operation. The operation allows selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value, with the cost being the length of the subarray.

### Program Analysis
The provided program includes a function `func_1` that is supposed to compute the minimum cost for one operation. The function logic is as follows:
1. It identifies the first index `i` where the element differs from its next neighbor.
2. It identifies the last index `j` where the element differs from its previous neighbor.
3. If all elements are equal (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), it returns 0.
4. Otherwise, it returns the maximum of two values:
   - The number of elements from `i+1` to the end of the list.
   - The number of elements from the start of the list to `j-1`.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary describes `func_1` as returning the number of elements between the first index where the element differs from its next neighbor and the first index from the end where the element differs from its previous neighbor, exclusive. If all elements are equal, it returns 0. If not all elements are equal, it returns the maximum of the minimum between the number of elements from the first differing element to the end of the list (exclusive) and the number of elements from the start of the list to the first differing element from the end (exclusive).

### Counterexample Analysis
The original assessment provides a counterexample:
- **Input:** `1 2 3 2 1`
- **Expected Output:** `2`
- **Actual Output:** `3`

Let's break down the logic:
- `i` will be `0` because `arr[0] == arr[1]` is false.
- `j` will be `4` because `arr[4] == arr[3]` is false.
- Since `arr[0]` is not equal to `arr[4]`, the function returns `max(min(5 - 0 - 1, 4), 0) = max(min(4, 4), 0) = 4`.

However, the expected output is `2`, which suggests an optimal operation could be selecting the subarray `[2, 3, 2]` and setting it to `2`, costing `3 - 2 + 1 = 2` burles.

### Conclusion
The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum number of burles required to make all elements equal with at most one operation. It fails to consider the optimal subarray to modify, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
