Reasoning:
The given program is attempting to solve the problem by identifying the smallest segment of the array that can be changed to make the entire array uniform with the minimum cost. The logic in the program is flawed, as it doesn't correctly account for all scenarios that would yield the minimum cost.

Let's break down the logic in the provided function `func_1(arr)`:

1. The function first finds the first index `i` where the element is different from its next neighbor. This is done to identify the start of a potential segment that needs to be changed.
2. Then, it finds the first index `j` from the end of the array where the element is different from its previous neighbor. This is done to identify the end of a potential segment that needs to be changed.
3. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it returns the number of elements between `i` and `j`, exclusive, or 0 if all elements are equal.
4. If the first and last elements are different, it returns the maximum of two values: the minimum between the number of elements from `i` to the end of the array (exclusive) and the number of elements from the start of the array to `j` (exclusive).

However, this logic does not guarantee the minimum cost. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function would identify `i = 0` and `j = 4` because the first and last elements are the same, but the minimum cost to make all elements equal is to change the segment `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to `1`, which costs 4 burles. The function would incorrectly return `j - i - 1 = 3`.

The correct approach should involve considering all possible values that the array can be changed to and calculating the minimum cost for each value. This can be done efficiently using dynamic programming or a greedy approach that considers the frequency of each element and the cost of changing segments.

Given the incorrect logic, the program does not always produce the correct minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
