To determine the output state, we need to consider the values of `i`, `j`, and `n` (where `n` is the length of the array `arr`).

Given:
- `i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.
- `j` is the first index from the end where `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]` or 0 if all elements are equal from the end to the beginning.
- The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.

Since the first and last elements of `arr` are not equal, `i` and `j` will not be equal to `len(arr) - 1` and `0` respectively. Therefore, `i` will be the first index where the consecutive elements differ, and `j` will be the first index from the end where the consecutive elements differ.

The return statement is `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

- `n - i - 1` is the number of elements between `i` and the end of the array (exclusive of `i` and the last element).
- `j` is the number of elements from the start of the array to `j` (exclusive of `j`).

Since `i` and `j` denote the points where the elements change, `min(n - i - 1, j)` gives the smaller of the two segments formed by these points. The `max(..., 0)` ensures that the result is not negative, but given the conditions, the result will naturally be non-negative.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum of the minimum between the number of elements between `i` and the end of the array (exclusive) and the number of elements from the start of the array to `j` (exclusive).**
