To determine the final output state after all iterations of the given loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop decrements `j` as long as `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`. This means `j` will keep decreasing until it reaches an index where the elements are not equal or until `j` becomes 0.

From the given information:
- After 1 iteration: `j` is `n - 2` and `arr[n - 1] == arr[n - 2]`
- After 2 iterations: `j` is `n - 4` and `arr[n - 3] == arr[n - 2]`
- After 3 iterations: `j` is `n - 5`

It is clear that `j` is decrementing by 1 each iteration as long as the condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` holds true. The loop will terminate when `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]` or when `j` becomes 0.

The final value of `j` will be the first index from the end where the elements are not equal, or 0 if all elements from the end to the beginning are equal.

Given the pattern, we can infer that the loop will continue until it finds an index where `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]` or `j` reaches 0. Therefore, the final state of `j` will be the first index from the end where the elements are not equal, or 0 if all elements are equal from the end to the beginning.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is the first index from the end where `arr[j] != arr[j - 1]` or 0 if all elements are equal from the end to the beginning.**

In simpler terms, `j` will be the index of the first element from the end that is different from the one before it, or 0 if all elements are the same.
