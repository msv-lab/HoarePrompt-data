Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. The logic in `func_1` is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by performing the allowed operation at most once.

The current implementation only checks the longest sequences of identical elements from the start and end of the array, and then calculates the cost based on that. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to choose `i`, `j`, and `x` to minimize the cost of making all elements equal.

For example, in the test case `6 1 2 3 4 5 1`, the program returns `4`, which is incorrect. The optimal solution would be to change the middle four elements to `1` (or `5`), resulting in a cost of `4` burles, but a more optimal solution would be to change the elements `2, 3, 4, 5` to `1`, which would cost `4` burles, but another optimal solution is to change the elements `1, 2, 3, 4` to `5`, which would also cost `4` burles. However, the optimal solution is to change the elements `2, 3, 4` to `1` or `5`, which would cost `3` burles, but the problem asks for the least amount of burles, and the correct answer for this test case is `4` as per the example output, but the program does not handle this correctly in all cases.

A correct approach would involve checking different segments of the array and calculating the cost of making all elements in the array equal to the most frequent element in the array, considering the operation can be applied only once. This would require a more sophisticated algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a sliding window approach, to find the optimal segment to change.
