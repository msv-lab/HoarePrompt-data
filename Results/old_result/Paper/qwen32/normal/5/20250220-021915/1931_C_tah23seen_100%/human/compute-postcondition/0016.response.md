The value of `j` is decremented by 1. Given that `j` was initially `n - 4`, after the operation `j -= 1`, `j` becomes `n - 5`. The other variable `i` remains unchanged. The precondition that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` was valid before the operation, but after decrementing `j`, this precondition no longer applies directly to the new value of `j`. However, we still know the initial state of `i` and the new value of `j`.

Output State: **`i` is the first index where `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal; `j` is `n - 5`**.
