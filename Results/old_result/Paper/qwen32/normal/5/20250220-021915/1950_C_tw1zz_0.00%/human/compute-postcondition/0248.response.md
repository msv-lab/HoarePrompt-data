The code snippet assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. This change does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is 'PM'; `h1` is '10'.**
