To determine what will be printed, let's break down the variables and their values based on the given initial state.

1. **`t`**: This is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440. However, `t` is not directly used in the print statement.
2. **`h`**: This is the hour part of the input time as a string. It can range from '00' to '23'.
3. **`m`**: This is the minute part of the input time as a string. It can range from '00' to '59'.
4. **`m1`**: This is the minute part of the input time as an integer. It is derived from `m` but not used in the print statement.
5. **`time`**: This is a string that is 'AM' if `h` is '01' or any hour from '02' to '11', otherwise it is 'PM'. So, if `h` is '00', '12', '13', ..., '23', `time` will be 'PM' except when `h` is '01' to '11'.
6. **`h1`**: This is the adjusted hour part of the input time as a string. It is derived as follows:
    - If `h` is '00', `h1` remains '00'.
    - If `h` is '01' to '11', `h1` is the same as `h`.
    - If `h` is '12', `h1` remains '12'.
    - If `h` is '13' to '23', `h1` is `h - 12` (and converted to a two-digit string if necessary).

Given these definitions, the print statement:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```
will concatenate `h1`, `':'`, `m`, `' '`, and `time` without any separators between them.

Let's describe the output based on the given conditions:

- `h1` will be the adjusted hour part as described above.
- `m` will be the minute part of the input time.
- `time` will be 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`.

The final output will be in the format `h1:m time` (without spaces between `h1` and `':'`, and between `m` and `time`).

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the adjusted hour part, m is the minute part, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part)**

For example, if `h` is '13' and `m` is '45':
- `h1` would be '01'.
- `time` would be 'PM'.
- The output would be `01:45 PM`.

Output: **h1:m time (where h1 is the adjusted hour part, m is the minute part, and time is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part)**
