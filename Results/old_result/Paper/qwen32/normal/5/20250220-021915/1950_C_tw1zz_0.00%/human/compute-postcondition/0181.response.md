Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is set to 'PM' if `h` is '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00'; `h1` is set to '07' if `h` is '19', '08' if `h` is '20', '09' if `h` is '21', '10' if `h` is '22', '11' if `h` is '23', '12' if `h` is '00', and remains unchanged otherwise.**
