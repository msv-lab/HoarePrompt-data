Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time; `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` equals '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string.**
