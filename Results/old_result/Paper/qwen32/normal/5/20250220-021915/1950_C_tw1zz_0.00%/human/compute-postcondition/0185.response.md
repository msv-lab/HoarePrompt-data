Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; if `h` is '15', `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '03'. Otherwise, `time` is set to 'PM' if `h` is '16' or any value from '17' to '23', or '00'. `h1` is set to '04' if `h` is '16', '05' if `h` is '17', '06' if `h` is '18', '07' if `h` is '19', '08' if `h` is '20', '09' if `h` is '21', '10' if `h` is '22', '11' if `h` is '23', and remains unchanged if `h` is '00'.**
