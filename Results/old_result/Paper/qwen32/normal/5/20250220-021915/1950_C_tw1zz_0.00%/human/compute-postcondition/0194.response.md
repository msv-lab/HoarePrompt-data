Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '06', `time` is 'AM' and `h1` is '06'. Otherwise, `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', otherwise 'PM'. If `h` is '07', `h1` is '07'. If `h` is '08', `h1` is '08'. If `h` is '09', `h1` is '09'. If `h` is '10', `h1` is '10'. If `h` is '11', `h1` is '11'. If `h` is '12', `h1` is '12'. If `h` is '13', `h1` is '01'. For any other value of `h` that is not '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', `h1` is adjusted to the corresponding 12-hour format (e.g., '14' becomes '02', '15' becomes '03', ..., '23' becomes '11', and '00' remains unchanged).**
