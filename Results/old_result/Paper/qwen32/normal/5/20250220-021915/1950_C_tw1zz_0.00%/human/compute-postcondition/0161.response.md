The code snippet sets the variable `time` to the string `'PM'`. The values of other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, `h1`, and `m1` as a string) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is 'PM'; `h1` is '05'; `m1` is the minute part of the input time as a string.**
