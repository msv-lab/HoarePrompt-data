Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is ''; `h1` is '05'.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440, `h` and `m` retain their original string values representing the hour and minute parts of the input time, `m1` retains its original integer value representing the minute part of the input time, `time` remains an empty string, and `h1` is now set to the string '05'.
