Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the input is a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". The loop converts the 24-hour format time to a 12-hour format time with an AM/PM suffix. The variable `h` holds the hour part of the input time as a string, and `m` holds the minute part. The variable `h1` is set to the converted hour in 12-hour format, and `time` is set to either 'AM' or 'PM'. The loop prints the converted time in the format "h1:m time" for each test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop will have processed all `t` test cases, converting each time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with the appropriate AM or PM suffix and printing the result.
