Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input time and it is not equal to '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17'. `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input time; `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input time. If `h` equals '18', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '19', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '20', then `h1` is '08' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '21', then `h1` is '09' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '22', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '23', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` equals '00', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` is an empty string and `time` is an empty string.**
