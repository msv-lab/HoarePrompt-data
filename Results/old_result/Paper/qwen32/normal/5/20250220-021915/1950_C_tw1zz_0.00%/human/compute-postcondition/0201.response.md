The loop head in the provided `for` loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will iterate a number of times equal to the integer input provided. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation condition. Therefore, the only state that could be adjusted in the loop head is the input value itself, which determines the number of iterations.

However, since the input is not a variable in the state provided and is not modifiable within the loop, and the loop variable `_` does not need to be adjusted, the state provided does not have any variables that need to be changed to prepare for the next iteration of the loop. The state remains the same as the input value for the loop iterations is not part of the state but rather an external input.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time; `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '01' or any hour from '02' to '11', otherwise 'PM'; `h1` is '01' if `h` is '01', '02' if `h` is '02', ..., '11' if `h` is '11', '12' if `h` is '12', '01' if `h` is '13', ..., '11' if `h` is '23', and '00' remains unchanged.**
