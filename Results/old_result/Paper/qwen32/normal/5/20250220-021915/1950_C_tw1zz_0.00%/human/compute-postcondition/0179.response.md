Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1440; `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string; `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string; `m1` is the minute part of the input time. If `h` is '21', then `time` is 'PM' and `h1` is '09'. Otherwise, `time` is 'PM' if `h` is '22', '23', or '00', and `h1` is '10' if `h` is '22', '11' if `h` is '23', '12' if `h` is '00', and `time` and `h1` remain unchanged otherwise.**
