Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440; h is the hour part of the input time as a string; m is the minute part of the input time as a string; m1 is the minute part of the input time; time is 'AM' if h is '03' or '04' or '05' or '06' or '07' or '08' or '09' or '10' or '11', otherwise 'PM'; h1 is '03' if h is '03', '04' if h is '04', '05' if h is '05', '06' if h is '06', '07' if h is '07', '08' if h is '08', '09' if h is '09', '10' if h is '10', '11' if h is '11', '12' if h is '12', '01' if h is '13', and for any other value of h that is not '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', h1 is adjusted to the corresponding 12-hour format (e.g., '14' becomes '02', '15' becomes '03', ..., '23' becomes '11', and '00' remains unchanged).**
