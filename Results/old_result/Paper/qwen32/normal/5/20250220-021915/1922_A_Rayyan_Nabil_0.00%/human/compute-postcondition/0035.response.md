Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

Initial State: 
- `l` is set to 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.
- Otherwise, `l` is set to 'NO'.

The print statement:
```python
print(l)
```

To determine the output, we need to understand the value of `l`. The value of `l` depends on the lists `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, `l` will be 'YES' if there is at least one index `i` where both `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If no such index exists, `l` will be 'NO'.

However, the specific elements of the lists `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `l` without this information.

Based on the given information, the most precise description we can provide is that `l` will be either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.

Output: **l (where l is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise 'NO')**
