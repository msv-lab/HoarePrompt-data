To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, otherwise `l` is 'NO'.
- The loop is `for i in range(t):`.

We need to adjust the state of `i` and `t` for the next iteration. The variable `i` is the loop index, and `t` is the total number of iterations the loop will perform.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current State:**
   - `i` is the current index at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations.

2. **Adjustment for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is the loop index, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it defines the total number of iterations.

### Example Adjustment:
- If `i` is 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
- `t` remains the same.

### Final State:
- The only state adjustments needed are for `i` (increment by 1).
- `l` does not need to be adjusted as it is a result of the loop body, not the loop head.

### Answer:
State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise l is 'NO', `i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains the same**.

To make it more concrete, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration:
State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise l is 'NO', `i` is 3, `t` remains the same**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as:
State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise l is 'NO', `i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains unchanged**.

So the final answer is:
State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index i such that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], otherwise l is 'NO', `i` is `i + 1`, `t` remains the same**.
