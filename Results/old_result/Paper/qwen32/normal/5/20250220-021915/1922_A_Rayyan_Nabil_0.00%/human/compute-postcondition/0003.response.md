The code snippet `n = int(input())` will reassign the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the input. This means the previous value of `n` (which was an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20) is now replaced by the new input integer. The other variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is the new input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `l` is 'YES'**.
