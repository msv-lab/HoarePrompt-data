The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `b`. This means `b` now holds the value of whatever the user inputs. The value of `l` is dependent on the comparison between `a`, `b`, and `c`, but since `c` is not mentioned in the code snippet, we cannot determine the new value of `l` based on this input alone. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, otherwise `l` is 'NO'; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value of the user input; `b` is the value of the new user input.**
