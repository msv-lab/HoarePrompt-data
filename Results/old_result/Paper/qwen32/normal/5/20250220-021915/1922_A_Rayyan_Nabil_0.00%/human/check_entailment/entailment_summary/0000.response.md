Reasoning:  
The provided program is intended to solve the problem by checking if there exists at least one position in each string where the characters in `a` and `b` differ from the character in `c`. However, the logic in the program is flawed. The program sets `l` to 'YES' as soon as it finds a single position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` differ from `c[i]` and does not check the rest of the string. This is incorrect because the program needs to ensure that for every position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `c[i]` to confirm that there exists a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

The correct approach would be to assume the answer is 'YES' and only set it to 'NO' if a position is found where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]`. This way, the program ensures that the condition holds for all positions.

Given the current logic, the program might incorrectly output 'YES' for cases where there is at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`, even if there is another position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
