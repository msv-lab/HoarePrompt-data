The code snippet provided assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `c`. This means that `c` will now hold the value of whatever the user inputs next. The values of the other variables (`l`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` such that `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, otherwise `l` is 'NO'; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is the value of the user input; `b` is the value of the new user input; `c` is the value of the latest user input.**
