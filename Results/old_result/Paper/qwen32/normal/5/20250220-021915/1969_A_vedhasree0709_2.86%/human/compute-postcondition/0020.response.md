The value of `j` is set to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `j` is 1.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2; `j` is 1.**
