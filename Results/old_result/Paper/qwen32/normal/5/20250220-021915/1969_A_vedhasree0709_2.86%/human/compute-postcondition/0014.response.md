The code snippet simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `j`. The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 1; `j` is 1**.
