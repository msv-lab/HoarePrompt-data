The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted such that it is still less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` is at least 1, and `i` being 2 is valid for the loop to execute if `n` is at least 3. Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to be at least 3 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` must be at least 3; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2**
