Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5000; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0; `j` is 1. The current value of `l[i]` is `i + 2` and the current value of `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. We only break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
