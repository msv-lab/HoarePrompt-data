The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement will print the integer `2` regardless of the values of `j`, `i`, `l`, or `n` as specified in the initial state. The value `2` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **2**
