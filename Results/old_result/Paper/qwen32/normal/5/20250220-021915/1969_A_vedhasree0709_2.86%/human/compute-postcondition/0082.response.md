The `print(3)` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `i`, `j`, `n`, or `l` that are described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer `3`.

Here is the explanation:
- The variable `i` is set to `n`.
- The variable `j` is set to `0`.
- The variable `n` is set to `n` (which is redundant as it is just reassigning `n` to itself).
- The variable `l` is a list of integers from the input.
- However, none of these variables are used in the `print(3)` statement.

Therefore, the output will be the integer `3`.

Output: **3**
