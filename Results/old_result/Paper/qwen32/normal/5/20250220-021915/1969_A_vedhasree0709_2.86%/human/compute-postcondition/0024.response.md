To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop terminates and how the variables `i` and `j` are modified.

The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. Within the loop, the condition `if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is checked. If this condition is met, `j` is set to 1 and the loop is exited. If the condition is not met, `i` is incremented by 1.

Given the output states after the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration, `i` is 1.
- After the second iteration, `i` is 2.
- After the third iteration, `i` is 3.

The loop will continue to increment `i` by 1 in each iteration until either the condition `if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met, or `i` exceeds `n - 1`.

### Final Output State:
- If the condition `if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met at any point during the loop, `j` will be set to 1 and the loop will terminate early.
- If the condition is never met, the loop will terminate when `i` becomes equal to `n`.

Therefore, the final output state depends on whether the condition is met at any point during the loop. If the condition is met, `j` will be 1, and `i` will be the value at which the condition was met. If the condition is never met, `j` will remain 0, and `i` will be `n`.

Given the initial state and the nature of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` remains the input integer.
- `l` remains the list of integers obtained from the input.
- `i` will be equal to `n` if the condition is never met, or the value at which the condition was met if it was met.
- `j` will be 1 if the condition `if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met at any point during the loop, otherwise `j` will be 0.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is either `n` or the value at which the condition was met; `j` is 1 if the condition was met, otherwise 0.**
