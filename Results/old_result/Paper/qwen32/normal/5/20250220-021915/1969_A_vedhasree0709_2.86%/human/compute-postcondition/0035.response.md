The `print(2)` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or objects defined in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer value `2`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`, `j`) and their potential values or relationships.
2. However, the `print(2)` statement does not reference any of these variables or objects.
3. The statement directly prints the integer `2`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
