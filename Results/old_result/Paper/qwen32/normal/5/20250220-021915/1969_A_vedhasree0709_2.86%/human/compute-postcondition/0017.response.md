The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `j`, and the conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement remain unchanged unless the new value of `i` causes the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` to be met, in which case `j` is set to 1 and the loop or if statement is broken out of. However, since only `i` is modified in the provided code snippet, we reflect only that change in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `j` or the loop.**
