Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is the new input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 5000; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 0. If `l[i]` is `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` is `i + 1`, then `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**
