The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. This value is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `i`) and their constraints or properties.
2. The `print` statement is `print(2)`, which directly outputs the integer `2`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `n`, `l`, or `i`, their values do not influence the output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
