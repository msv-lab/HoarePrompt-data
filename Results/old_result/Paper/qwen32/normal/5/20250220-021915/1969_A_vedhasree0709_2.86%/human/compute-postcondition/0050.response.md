Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is at least 3; `l` is the list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 2. If `l[2]` equals 4 and `l[3]` equals 3, then `j` is set to 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `j` or the control flow.**
