To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to carefully analyze the loop's behavior and the given output states after the first three iterations.

### Analysis:
The loop modifies the list based on the conditions:
- `list[i] > 1`
- `list[i - 1] > 0`
- `list[i + 1] > 0`

If all these conditions are met, the loop performs the following operations:
- `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
- `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
- `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`

### Given Output States:
1. **After 1st iteration**: `list` is [0, 0, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1
2. **After 2nd iteration**: `list` is [0, 0, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1
3. **After 3rd iteration**: `list` is [0, -1, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1

### Observations:
- After the first iteration, the list becomes [0, 0, 0]. This means that the loop must have modified the list in such a way that all elements became zero.
- The second iteration also results in the same list [0, 0, 0], indicating that the loop did not modify the list further.
- The third iteration results in [0, -1, 0], which is not possible given the loop's conditions and operations if the list was [0, 0, 0] after the second iteration.

Given the above observations, it's clear that the list must have been [0, 0, 0] after the first iteration, and the loop did not modify the list further in subsequent iterations.

### Conclusion:
Since the list becomes [0, 0, 0] after the first iteration and remains unchanged in subsequent iterations, the final output state after all iterations is:

Output State: **[0, 0, 0]**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop, the list is completely zeroed out.
