list is a list of lists, where each sublist contains n integers (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the elements of the array for each test case, and t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer in the sublists is in the range 0 to 10^9.
