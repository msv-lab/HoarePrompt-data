The code modifies the element at index `i + 1` in the list by subtracting the value at index `i - 1` from it. Given `i` is `2`, the element at index `3` (which is `1`) is updated by subtracting the value at index `1` (which is `1`).

Thus, the element at index `3` changes from `1` to `0`.

Output State: **`list` is `[0, 1, 2, 0]`, `i` is `2`, `n` is greater than `4`**.
