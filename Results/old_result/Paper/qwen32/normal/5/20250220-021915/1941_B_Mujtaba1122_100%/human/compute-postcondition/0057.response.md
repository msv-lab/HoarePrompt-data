To determine the postcondition, we need to start with the given precondition and then incorporate the negation of the if condition. The precondition states that the list is `[0, 0, 0]`. The if condition is `if (func_1(list, n))`. Since we are considering the case where the if block is not executed and the else block is entered, we need to consider the scenario where `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to `False`.

However, since the function `func_1` is not defined, we can't determine the exact condition that `func_1` checks. But we can still express the postcondition in terms of the negation of the if condition.

Let's assume that `func_1(list, n)` checks some condition involving the list and `n`. The negation of `func_1(list, n)` means that whatever condition `func_1` checks is not met. Since we don't have more details about `func_1`, we can only state that the condition that `func_1` checks is false.

Therefore, the postcondition will be:

Postcondition: **The list is `[0, 0, 0]`, and the condition checked by `func_1(list, n)` is false.**
