The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` modifies the element at index `i - 1` of `list`. Given that `i` is 1, the element at index `0` of `list` is modified. The operation essentially sets `list[0]` to `list[0] - 1 * list[0]`, which simplifies to `list[0] = 0`.

Thus, the value of `list` changes to `[0, 0, 0]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list` is [0, 0, 0], `n` is 3, `i` is 1**.
