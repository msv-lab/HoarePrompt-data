### Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an array of integers.
- We can perform an operation where we choose an index `i` (2 <= i <= n-1) and:
  - Decrease `a[i-1]` by 1.
  - Decrease `a[i]` by 2.
  - Decrease `a[i+1]` by 1.
- We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using this operation.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Checks if the first `n` elements of the list are all zeros.
   - Returns `False` if any element is not zero, otherwise returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as `a[i] > 1`, `a[i-1] > 0`, and `a[i+1] > 0`.
   - The operation is incorrect as it decreases `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`, `2 * list[i-1]`, and `1 * list[i-1]` respectively, which is not aligned with the problem description. The problem specifies that we should decrease `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - After the loop, it checks if the array is all zeros using `func_1`. If it is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Code:
- The operation inside `func_2` is incorrect. It should decrease `a[i+1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i-1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by `1 * list[i-1]`, `2 * list[i-1]`, and `1 * list[i-1]`.
- The logic to determine if the array can be made all zeros is flawed because of the incorrect operation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
