To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables.

The loop iterates from `m-1` down to `1`. During each iteration:
1. It checks if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`.
2. If the condition is true, it constructs a list `nums` which includes the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
3. It then checks if `nums` is sorted.
4. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
5. If `nums` is sorted, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first element of `nums`.
6. If the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is not true, the loop continues to the next iteration without any changes.

The loop will continue until it either breaks due to `nums` not being sorted or completes all iterations.

After the loop has finished executing, the final output state will be:
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged.
- The value of `arr` will have been modified based on the conditions within the loop.
- The value of `ans` will be `False` if any `nums` was not sorted during the loop iterations; otherwise, it will remain `True`.

The final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers that may have been modified based on the loop's conditions, and `ans` is a boolean value indicating whether all `nums` constructed during the loop were sorted.**

In simpler terms: After the loop, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` stay the same, `arr` might have been changed, and `ans` tells us if the loop found any unsorted `nums`.
