Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is `False` if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` retains its previous value, `i` is `i - 1` if `nums` is not sorted, `nums` is a list of integers created by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` with `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
