To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
2. `n` is assigned the value of `t`, so `n` is also an integer within the same range.
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 99\).
4. `m` is an input integer (the exact value of `m` is not provided).
5. `arr` is a list of integers that may have been modified based on the loop's conditions.
6. `ans` is a boolean value indicating whether all `nums` constructed during the loop were sorted.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

This statement uses a list `['NO', 'YES']` and indexes it with the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is a boolean, it can only be `True` or `False`:
- If `ans` is `False`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][False]` evaluates to `'NO'`.
- If `ans` is `True`, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][True]` evaluates to `'YES'`.

Thus, the output will be either `'NO'` or `'YES'` based on the value of `ans`.

Given the information, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **'NO' if ans is False, 'YES' if ans is True**
