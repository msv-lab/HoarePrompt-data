The code snippet provided modifies the `nums` list based on the values of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`. Specifically, it takes the digits of `arr[i-1]` (converted to a string and then to a list of integers), and appends `arr[i]` to this list.

Given the initial state, let's break down the changes:

- `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer between 1 and 10^3.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is assigned the value of `t`.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99.
- `m` remains unchanged as it must be at least 2.
- `arr` remains unchanged as it is a list of integers provided by user input.
- `ans` remains unchanged as it is `True`.
- `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` remains unchanged as it is a precondition.

The only variable that changes is `nums`, which is newly defined as a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is `True`, and `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]; nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**
