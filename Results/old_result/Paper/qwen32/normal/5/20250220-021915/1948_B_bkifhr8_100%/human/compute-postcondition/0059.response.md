The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a throwaway variable) and `n`. Since `_` is not a variable we need to adjust, the only variable we need to consider is `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was the value of `t`, and the loop has iterated `t` times so far. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 because the loop will run as long as `_` is in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers that may have been modified based on the loop's conditions, and `ans` is a boolean value indicating whether all `nums` constructed during the loop were sorted.**
