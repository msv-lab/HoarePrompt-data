The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from `m - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive). 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1, making `i` equal to `m - 3`.

The variable `m` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop range.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is assigned the value of `t`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99; `m` is at least 2; `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user input; `ans` is a boolean value; `i` is `m - 3`.**
