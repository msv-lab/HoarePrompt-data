Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `ans` is `True`, and at the current index `i`, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`.**
