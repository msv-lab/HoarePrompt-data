The given code snippet only includes a line that reads an input and assigns it to the variable `m`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, or `ans`. Therefore, the only change is that `m` is now assigned the value of the input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is assigned the value of `t - 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 99, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers that may have been modified based on the loop's conditions, and `ans` is a boolean value indicating whether all `nums` constructed during the loop were sorted.**
