Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is `n - ((i + 2) * (i + 2) - (i + 2))`; `y` is `(i + 2) * (i + 2)`, which is the new value of `y` after the assignment; `cnt` is `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `y` is recalculated to be `(i + 2) * (i + 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
