The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `m` is greater than 1.

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop head. The variables `cnt`, `x`, and `y` are derived from `i` and `n`, so they will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` in the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to move to the next iteration.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `cnt` is `(n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) + ((i + 1) > 1)`; `x` is `n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))`; `y` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`; `i` is `i + 1`**

However, to adhere strictly to the format provided, we'll state the variables that can be directly adjusted in the loop head, which is `i`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 1`**
