You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the GCD of the original a and b; b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original a and b, which is now stored in a. Since b is 0, the GCD is the value of a.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is `m`; `cnt` is the accumulated sum of `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` for `i` from `1` to `m - 1`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; `i` is `m`; `cnt` is the accumulated sum of `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` for `i` from `1` to `m - 1`; `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns `cnt`, which is the accumulated sum of `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` for `i` from `1` to `m - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `m` where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6. It calculates the accumulated sum of `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` for all integers `i` from 1 to `m - 1`. If this accumulated sum is zero, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the accumulated sum.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used in `func_2`, which is the main function responsible for counting the valid pairs.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the implementation of `func_2` does not directly check the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0` for all pairs `(a, b)`.

Instead, the function uses a different logic that involves calculating `x` and `y` and then counting based on a specific formula. This formula does not directly relate to the condition given in the problem statement, and it seems to be an incorrect or incomplete attempt to solve the problem.

Let's consider a simple test case to see if the function works as expected:

For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`. The function `func_2` should return `3` for this input, but let's see what it actually returns.

```python
print(func_2(2, 3))  # Expected output: 3
```

Running this, we find that the output is not `3`, indicating that the function does not correctly count the valid pairs.

Since the function does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and fails to produce the correct output for at least one test case, the correctness of the program is `False`.
