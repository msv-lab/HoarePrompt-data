To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to compare the problem description with the provided code, especially focusing on the function `func_2` as it is the primary function responsible for solving the problem.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - However, it is not used in `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The logic implemented in `func_2` involves calculating `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` and then counting based on `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)`.
   - The function returns 1 if the accumulated sum is zero, otherwise, it returns the accumulated sum.

### Function Summary:
- The function `func_2` is described to calculate the accumulated sum of `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` for all integers `i` from 1 to `m - 1`.
- If the accumulated sum is zero, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the accumulated sum.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness of `func_2`, we need to check if the formula `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each \(i\).

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:
- The formula `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)` seems to be an attempt to count the number of valid \(a\) values for each fixed \(b = i\).
- The term `(n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i)` calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b = i\).
- The term `(i > 1)` adds 1 if \(i > 1\), which might be an attempt to handle the case when \(b = 1\).

However, the formula does not directly relate to the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. Instead, it seems to be an optimized or transformed version of the condition, possibly derived through mathematical insights.

### Testing:
Let's test the function with some example inputs to see if it produces the expected results.

```python
print(func_2(1, 1))  # Expected output: 1
print(func_2(2, 3))  # Expected output: 3
print(func_2(3, 5))  # Expected output: 4
print(func_2(10, 8)) # Expected output: 14
print(func_2(100, 1233)) # Expected output: 153
print(func_2(1000000, 1145141)) # Expected output: 1643498
```

If the function produces the correct outputs for these test cases, it suggests that the logic is correct. Let's run the tests.

### Conclusion:
After running the tests, if the function produces the correct outputs, we can conclude that the function is correct. However, if it fails any test case, we need to re-evaluate the logic.

Let's run the tests in Python to verify the correctness.
```python
import math

# Function 1: Calculate GCD
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

# Function 2: Calculate the number of valid pairs
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt

# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (1, 1, 1),
    (2, 3, 3),
    (3, 5, 4),
    (10, 8, 14),
    (100, 1233, 153),
    (1000000, 1145141, 1643498)
]

# Run the test cases
results = [(n, m, func_2(n, m)) for n, m, expected in test_cases]
print(results)
```
```output
[(1, 1, 1), (2, 3, 3), (3, 5, 4), (10, 8, 14), (100, 1233, 153), (1000000, 1145141, 1643498)]
```
The results of the test cases are as follows:
- For \((n, m) = (1, 1)\), the output is \(1\), which matches the expected result.
- For \((n, m) = (2, 3)\), the output is \(3\), which matches the expected result.
- For \((n, m) = (3, 5)\), the output is \(4\), which matches the expected result.
- For \((n, m) = (10, 8)\), the output is \(14\), which matches the expected result.
- For \((n, m) = (100, 1233)\), the output is \(153\), which matches the expected result.
- For \((n, m) = (1000000, 1145141)\), the output is \(1643498\), which matches the expected result.

Since the function `func_2` produces the correct outputs for all the provided test cases, we can conclude that the implementation is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is correct based on the provided test cases and the function summary.
