The code assigns the value of `n - (i * i - i)` to the variable `x`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `cnt` also remains unchanged. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so the value of `x` will depend on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `cnt` is 0; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**.
