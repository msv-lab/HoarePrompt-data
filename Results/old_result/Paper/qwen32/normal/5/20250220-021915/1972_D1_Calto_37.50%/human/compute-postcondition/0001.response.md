The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `m`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `m`. If `m` is greater than 1, the loop will execute because the range function will generate at least one value (specifically, `1`).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop starts with `i` taking the value `1`.
2. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than `1`.

The initial state of `n` and `cnt` does not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `m` is greater than `1`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `cnt` is 0**
