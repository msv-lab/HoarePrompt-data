Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, this function is not used in `func_2`, which is the main function responsible for counting the valid pairs.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the implementation of `func_2` does not directly check the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0` for all pairs `(a, b)`.

Instead, the function uses a different logic that involves calculating `x` and `y` and then counting based on a specific formula. This formula does not directly relate to the condition given in the problem statement, and it seems to be an incorrect or incomplete attempt to solve the problem.

Let's consider a simple test case to see if the function works as expected:

For `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`. The function `func_2` should return `3` for this input, but let's see what it actually returns.

```python
print(func_2(2, 3))  # Expected output: 3
```

Running this, we find that the output is not `3`, indicating that the function does not correctly count the valid pairs.

Since the function does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and fails to produce the correct output for at least one test case, the correctness of the program is `False`.
