### Reasoning:

The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. However, this function is not used anywhere in the provided code, which suggests that it might be a leftover or an incorrect assumption.

`func_2` is the core function that calculates the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\). According to the problem statement, a pair \((a, b)\) is valid if \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the implementation inside `func_2` does not directly follow the problem's conditions. Instead, it computes a count using a loop that iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) and performs calculations involving \(n\) and \(i\). The specific calculations inside the loop do not seem to directly relate to the conditions given in the problem statement.

The provided annotated states for `func_2` mention that the count is accumulated based on a specific formula, but this formula does not appear to be derived from the problem's conditions. The final return statement checks if the count is zero and returns 1 in that case, otherwise, it returns the accumulated count. This logic also does not align with the problem's requirements.

Given that the implementation in `func_2` does not seem to correctly address the problem's conditions, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
