### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it is not used anywhere in `func_2`, which is the main function responsible for counting the valid pairs.

2. **Function `func_2`**: The primary issue lies in the logic of `func_2`. The function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the implementation of `func_2` does not directly check this condition. Instead, it uses a different formula involving `x` and `y` and counts based on that formula.

3. **Formula Analysis**: The formula used in `func_2` is:
   \[
   x = n - (i * i - i)
   \]
   \[
   y = i * i
   \]
   \[
   cnt = cnt + \left(\frac{x}{y}\right) + (i > 1)
   \]
   This formula does not directly relate to the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0` for all pairs `(a, b)`. The formula seems to be an incorrect or incomplete attempt to solve the problem, as it does not account for the GCD condition properly.

4. **Test Case Verification**: The original assessment correctly points out that for `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`, and the function should return `3`. However, the function does not return `3`, indicating that it does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and fails to produce the correct output for at least one test case. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
