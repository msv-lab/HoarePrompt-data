Reasoning:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). The given program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, `func_2` does not directly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

The logic in `func_2` seems to have been derived from a different approach that might have simplified the problem under certain assumptions or optimizations. However, the provided explanation and the implementation do not align with the problem's requirements. The code in `func_2` does not check if a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) for all pairs (a, b). Instead, it calculates a different accumulated sum based on a specific formula.

Given the complexity and the specific nature of the problem, the implementation in `func_2` does not seem to correctly solve the problem as described. The formula used in `func_2` does not match the condition a + b being a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Therefore, the program as a whole does not meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
