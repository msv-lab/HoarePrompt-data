The value of `y` is assigned the value of `i * i`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code snippet. The value of `i` was previously described as `i + 1`, which suggests that `i` has already been incremented by 1 before this code snippet is executed. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `y` and the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6 and `m` > 1; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`; `y` is `i * i`.**
