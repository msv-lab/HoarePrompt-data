The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` updates the value of `n` to the integer value of the string located at the index `index` in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged unless they depend on `n`, which they do not in this specific snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 3; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by the original `n`, then decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of `last_year` before the code snippet, and the second being the string representation of `last_year` after the code snippet; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is the value obtained after adjusting `last_year` in each iteration according to the formula `last_year = ((last_year + a[i]) // a[i]) * a[i]` for i from 1 to n-1.**
