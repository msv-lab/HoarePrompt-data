Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 1; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    last_year = a[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
        last_year = next_year
    results.append(str(last_year))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input line; `index` is 2 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`; `a` is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is the integer value of `data[index + i - 2]` for 1 <= i <= n; `last_year` is the value obtained after the loop completes all iterations, calculated as `last_year = ((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]` after the last iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 3; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by (n-1); `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of `last_year` before the code snippet, and the second being the string representation of `last_year` after the code snippet; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is the value obtained after adjusting `last_year` in each iteration according to the formula `last_year = ((last_year + a[i]) // a[i]) * a[i]` for i from 1 to n-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, and `last_year` will have been updated `n-1` times according to the loop's formula. The variable `T` will have been decremented by `n` and then by 1, as described in the initial state. The `results` list will contain the original `last_year` before the loop started as its first element, the final `last_year` after all iterations as its second element, and the string representation of `last_year` as its third element. All other variables (`t`, `data`, `index`, `a`) will remain unchanged from their initial states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
