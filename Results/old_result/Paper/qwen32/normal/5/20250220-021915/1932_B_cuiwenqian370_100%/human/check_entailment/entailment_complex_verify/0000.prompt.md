You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a final value based on the provided integers and outputs the result for each test case, one per line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The code reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their respective periodicities `a`.
3. It initializes the `last_year` to the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
4. For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year (`next_year`) in which the sign will occur based on the `last_year` and the current sign's periodicity `a[i]`. The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the `last_year` and at the next multiple of `a[i]`.
5. It updates `last_year` to `next_year` and continues this process for all signs.
6. Finally, it stores the result for each test case and prints all results at the end.

The code correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. It also handles the edge cases such as:
- When all signs have the same periodicity.
- When the number of signs is 1.
- When the periodicities are large numbers.

Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases as per the problem description.
