Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 4 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by the original `n`, then decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of `last_year` before the code snippet, and the second being the string representation of `last_year` after the code snippet; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]; `last_year` is the value of `next_year`; `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

In simpler terms, the value of `next_year` is recalculated using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which simplifies to `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`. The value of `last_year` is then updated to this new `next_year` value. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
