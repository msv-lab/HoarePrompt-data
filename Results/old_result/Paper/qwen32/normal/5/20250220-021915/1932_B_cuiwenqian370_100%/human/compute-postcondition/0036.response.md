To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `data` is a list of strings
- `index` is `2*n + 3`
- `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by 1
- `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`
- `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`
- `last_year` is `(a[0] + 2*a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`
- `next_year` is `(a[0] + 2*a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`
- `i` is 3

Code Snippet:
```python
next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
```

Let's break down the code snippet:
- The new value of `next_year` is calculated using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`
- Simplifying the formula, we get `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`
- This means `next_year` is the result of `(last_year + a[i])` divided by `a[i]` and then multiplied by `a[i]`, effectively making `next_year` a multiple of `a[i]`

Given that the only variable being updated is `next_year`, let's express the new value of `next_year` explicitly in terms of the initial state:
- `next_year` becomes `(last_year + a[3]) // a[3] * a[3]`

Since `last_year` and `a[3]` are part of the initial state, we can leave them as they are in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is `2*n + 3`; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing one element, which is the string representation of `last_year`; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]`; `last_year` is `(a[0] + 2*a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[3]) // a[3] * a[3]`; `i` is 3**
