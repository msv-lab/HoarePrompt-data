Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 4 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by the original `n`, then decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of `last_year` before the code snippet, and the second being the string representation of `last_year` after the code snippet; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]; `last_year` is the value of `next_year`; `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `last_year` has been updated to be equal to `next_year`. All other variables retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
