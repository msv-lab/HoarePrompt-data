Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 4 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by the original `n`, then decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of `last_year` before the code snippet, and the second being the string representation of `last_year` after the code snippet; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]; `last_year` is the value of `a[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
    last_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 4 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by the original `n`, then decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of `last_year` before the code snippet, and the second being the string representation of `last_year` after the code snippet; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]; `last_year` is the value of `next_year`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 4 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by the original `n`, then decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of `last_year` before the code snippet, and the second being the string representation of `last_year` after the code snippet; `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]; `last_year` is the value of `next_year`; `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is an integer greater than 1; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2*n + 4 + n; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, decremented by the original `n`, then decremented by 1; `results` is a list containing two elements, the first being the string representation of the original `last_year`, and the second being the string representation of the updated `last_year` (which is equal to `next_year`); `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index - n:index]; `last_year` is equal to `next_year`; `next_year` is `(last_year + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2]`; `i` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
