To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to understand the calculation of `ans` based on the given initial state.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
   - `n`: Number of sticks for the current test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
   - `a`: List of integers representing the lengths of the sticks for the current test case.
   - `cnt`: Dictionary where each key is a unique stick length from `a` and its value is the count of how many times that length appears in `a`.
   - `ans`: Sum of `x // 3` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`. This means for each unique stick length, we count how many times it appears (`x`), then we integer divide this count by 3 and sum all these results.

2. **Calculation of `ans`:**
   - For each unique stick length in `a`, we count how many times it appears.
   - For each count `x`, we compute `x // 3`.
   - We sum all these results to get `ans`.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `a = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`.
   - `cnt` will be `{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}`.
   - For `1`, `x = 3`, so `x // 3 = 1`.
   - For `2`, `x = 2`, so `x // 3 = 0`.
   - For `3`, `x = 1`, so `x // 3 = 0`.
   - Therefore, `ans = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of `x // 3` for all `x` in `cnt.values()`, where `cnt` is the dictionary representing the count of each unique stick length in the list `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of x // 3 for all x in cnt.values(), and cnt is the dictionary of stick lengths and their counts)**
