You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of sticks and their respective lengths. For each test case, it calculates how many sets of three sticks can be formed from the sticks of the same length and prints this count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the sticks. The main issue lies in the assumption that any group of three sticks of the same length can form a regular polygon. This is incorrect because a regular polygon requires all sides to be equal, and the minimum number of sides for a polygon is 3. However, the program only considers groups of three sticks to form a polygon, which means it fails to account for polygons with more than 3 sides.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation: With 6 sticks of length 2, we can form 2 equilateral triangles (3-sided polygons).

However, the provided program will output:
```
2
```
which is correct for this specific case, but it does not generalize correctly. Consider another test case:

Input:
```
1
9
4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Explanation: With 9 sticks of length 4, we can form 3 equilateral triangles (3-sided polygons).

However, the provided program will output:
```
3
```
which is correct for this specific case as well, but it does not generalize correctly. The problem arises when we have more than 3 sticks of the same length and can form polygons with more than 3 sides.

Consider a more complex test case:

Input:
```
1
8
5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation: With 8 sticks of length 5, we can form 2 squares (4-sided polygons).

However, the provided program will output:
```
2
```
which is correct for this specific case as well, but it does not generalize correctly. The problem arises when we have more than 4 sticks of the same length and can form polygons with more than 4 sides.

Consider another test case:

Input:
```
1
10
6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation: With 10 sticks of length 6, we can form 2 pentagons (5-sided polygons).

However, the provided program will output:
```
3
```
which is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes that any group of three sticks can form a polygon.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly account for polygons with more than 3 sides. The program should consider the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides and should not limit itself to only groups of three sticks.
