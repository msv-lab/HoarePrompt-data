To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans += x // 3
```

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a single integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)
- `n` is a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer
- `ans` is 0
- `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair

The variable `x` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its value is unknown. However, the code snippet uses `x` to perform an integer division by 3 and adds the result to `ans`.

Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we can't determine its exact value. However, we can describe the updated state of `ans` in terms of `x`.

The value of `ans` will be updated to `0 + (x // 3)`, which simplifies to `x // 3`.

Thus, the output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is a single integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a single integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `ans` is `x // 3`, `cnt` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.**
