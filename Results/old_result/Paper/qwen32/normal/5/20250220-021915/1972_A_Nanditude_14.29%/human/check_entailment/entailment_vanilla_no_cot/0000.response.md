Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The logic for inserting and sorting the array is flawed. The program attempts to insert a problem of difficulty `b[j]` into the array `a` when `b[j] < a[i]`, but this does not align with the problem's requirements. Instead, it should be inserting a new problem with difficulty `w` (which is not necessarily `b[j]`), and then removing the highest difficulty problem from `a`.

2. The program does not ensure that the array `a` remains sorted after each insertion and removal operation, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

3. The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program, and it sorts the array in reverse order, which is not needed for the problem.

A correct approach would involve using a priority queue (or a sorted list) to manage the difficulties of the problems, and iteratively adding new problems with the smallest possible difficulty until the condition `a_i <= b_i` is satisfied for all `i`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math
import bisect

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            # We need to add a problem of difficulty less than or equal to b[i]
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)
```

However, the above solution still doesn't correctly simulate the process of adding a new problem and removing the most difficult one. A more correct approach would be:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if a[i] > b[i]:
            # We need to add a problem of difficulty less than or equal to b[i]
            bisect.insort(a, b[i])
            a.pop()  # Remove the last (most difficult) problem
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)
```

This version correctly simulates the process of adding a new problem and removing the most difficult one until the condition `a_i <= b_i` is satisfied for all `i`.
