The code snippet `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. 

Given the initial state, the list `c` already contains either `[y, x]` or just `[a[0]]` depending on the conditions specified. After appending `a[i]`, the list `c` will now include this new element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `n` is 1 or 2, where `n` is 2 if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `n` is 1; `c` is a list that now contains the original elements plus `a[i]`. If `i` > 0 and `a[i]` > 10, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` if `n` is greater than 0.**
