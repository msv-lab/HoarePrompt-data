The value of `n` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `n` is 0, so after the operation, `n` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3; `n` is 2; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `c` is a list containing the values `y` and `x`; `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10; `y` is less than or equal to `x`.**
