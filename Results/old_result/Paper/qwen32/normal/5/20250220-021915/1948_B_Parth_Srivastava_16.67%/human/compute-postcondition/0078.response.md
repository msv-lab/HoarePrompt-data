The code snippet `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `c`. This affects the list `c` by adding `a[i]` as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values are directly dependent on `c`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3
- `a` is a list of integers with at least one element
- `k` is an input integer
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0
- `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0
- `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4
- `c` is a list that contains `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, or just the first element of `a` if `a[i]` is not greater than 10 or if `y` > `x`. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` > 0, `x` is appended to `c` and `n` is set to 3 or 4 if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `n` is incremented by 1 after being set to 2 if `y` <= `x`, or 1 otherwise. If `y >= c[n - 1]`, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element. If `i == 0` and `a[i]` > 10, `n` is 3 or 4 and `x` is appended to `c`. If `i > 0` and `a[i]` > 10, `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` if `n` is greater than 0; if `i == 0` and `a[i]` > 10, `c` includes `a[i]` as an additional element.

After executing `c.append(a[i])`, the list `c` now includes `a[i]` as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0; `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4; `c` is a list that includes all previous elements and `a[i]` as the last element.**
