### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine whether a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are greater than or equal to 10 into their constituent digits. The function `func_1` processes each test case and checks if the array can be sorted after performing the allowed operations.

However, the logic within `func_1` is flawed. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Splitting**:
   - The program splits numbers greater than 10 into their digits but does not correctly handle all cases. For example, if a number like 123 is encountered, it should be split into 1, 2, and 3. However, the current implementation only handles two-digit numbers and does not account for numbers with more than two digits.
  
2. **Incorrect Comparison Logic**:
   - The logic for comparing elements and deciding whether to split them is flawed. For instance, the condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` and subsequent checks might not correctly determine if the array can be sorted after splitting.

3. **Inadequate Sorting Check**:
   - After attempting to split the numbers, the program checks if the resulting array `c` is sorted. However, the approach to splitting numbers is incorrect, so the resulting array `c` may not accurately represent the array after all possible splits.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the second test case from the example:

**Input:**
```
3
12 28 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

**Current Program Behavior:**
- The program will split 12 into 1 and 2, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
- It then checks if this array is sorted, which it is not. However, the logic for splitting and checking is flawed, and the program might not correctly handle more complex cases.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the logic for splitting numbers and the incorrect comparison logic, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
