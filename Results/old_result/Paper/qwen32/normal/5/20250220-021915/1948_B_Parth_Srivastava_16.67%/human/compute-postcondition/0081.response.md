Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0; `n` is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6; `c` is a list that includes all previous elements. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` > 0, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element if `y` >= `c[n - 1]`, and `x` is appended to `c` and `n` is set to 3 or 4 if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `n` is incremented by 1 after being set to 2 if `y` <= `x`, or 1 otherwise. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` == 0, `c` includes `y` and `x` as its last two elements if `y` <= `x`, otherwise `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element. If `a[i]` <= 10, `c` includes `a[i]` as its last element. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` == 0 and `y` <= `x`, `n` is 3, 4, 5, or 6. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` == 0 and `y` > `x`, `n` is 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` > 0, `n` is 2, 3, or 4. If `a[i]` <= 10, `n` is 2, 3, or 4.**
