You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `k` and a list of integers `a`. It processes the list `a` by potentially splitting two-digit numbers into their tens and units digits under certain conditions, sorts the resulting list, and checks if the original processed list is already sorted. It appends `1` to a list `b` if the processed list is sorted, otherwise it appends `0`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Logic for Splitting Elements**: The code attempts to split numbers greater than 10 into their digits, but it does not correctly handle the insertion of these digits into the list. For example, if the list is `[12, 3, 45]`, the code should transform it to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and then check if it is sorted. However, the current logic does not correctly manage the insertion of digits and the comparison with the previous elements.

2. **Comparison and Insertion Logic**: The code uses a variable `n` to keep track of the number of elements in the list `c`. However, this variable is not correctly updated, and the logic for comparing and inserting elements is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for inserting digits are not correctly checked, and the list `c` is not always correctly updated.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if the array contains numbers like `12` and `100`, the code should correctly split these numbers into `[1, 2]` and `[1, 0, 0]` respectively and then check if the resulting list can be sorted. The current logic fails to handle such cases correctly.

4. **Sorting Check**: After attempting to split the numbers, the code checks if the list `c` is sorted. However, due to the incorrect insertion logic, the list `c` is not always correctly formed, leading to incorrect results.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

The code incorrectly determines that the array cannot be sorted after attempting to split the numbers. This is due to the flawed logic for splitting and inserting digits into the list.

Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
