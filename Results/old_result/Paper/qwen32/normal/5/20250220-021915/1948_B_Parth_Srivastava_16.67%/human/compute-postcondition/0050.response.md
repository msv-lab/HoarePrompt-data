The code snippet appends `y` to the list `c`. This affects the list `c` directly. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are dependent on `c` or `y`, which is not the case here.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 1`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10; `n` is 1 or 2, where `n` is 2 if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `n` is 1; `c` is a list that contains `y` and `x` if `y` <= `x` and `a[i]` is greater than 10, or just the first element of `a` if `a[i]` is not greater than 10 or if `y` > `x`, and now `c` also contains `y` appended to it. If `i` > 0 and `a[i]` > 10, then `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]` if `n` is greater than 0.**
