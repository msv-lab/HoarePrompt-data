Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^3; `a` is a list of integers with at least one element; `k` is an input integer; `i` is `i + 2`; `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0; `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 if `a[i]` is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0; `n` is 2, 3, or 4; `c` is a list that includes all previous elements and `a[i]` as the last element.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is incremented by 1, so if `n` was 1, it becomes 2; if `n` was 2, it becomes 3; and if `n` was 3, it becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
