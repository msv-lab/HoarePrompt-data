Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Let's analyze the issues in the code:

1. **Logic for Splitting Elements**: The code attempts to split numbers greater than 10 into their digits, but it does not correctly handle the insertion of these digits into the list. For example, if the list is `[12, 3, 45]`, the code should transform it to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and then check if it is sorted. However, the current logic does not correctly manage the insertion of digits and the comparison with the previous elements.

2. **Comparison and Insertion Logic**: The code uses a variable `n` to keep track of the number of elements in the list `c`. However, this variable is not correctly updated, and the logic for comparing and inserting elements is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for inserting digits are not correctly checked, and the list `c` is not always correctly updated.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The code does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if the array contains numbers like `12` and `100`, the code should correctly split these numbers into `[1, 2]` and `[1, 0, 0]` respectively and then check if the resulting list can be sorted. The current logic fails to handle such cases correctly.

4. **Sorting Check**: After attempting to split the numbers, the code checks if the list `c` is sorted. However, due to the incorrect insertion logic, the list `c` is not always correctly formed, leading to incorrect results.

Here is a counterexample where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

The code incorrectly determines that the array cannot be sorted after attempting to split the numbers. This is due to the flawed logic for splitting and inserting digits into the list.

Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
