Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program, taking into account the annotations and the original assessment.

### Problem Analysis
The problem states that Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. The goal is to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, starting from zero cubes.

### Key Points
1. **Adding and Removing Cubes**: Nikita can add or remove cubes, meaning he can increase or decrease the height of the tower by 1 per move.
2. **Parity Consideration**: Since Nikita starts with 0 cubes, after an even number of moves, the number of cubes must be even (since each pair of moves can either add and then remove a cube or vice versa, resulting in no net change or a net change of 2 cubes). Similarly, after an odd number of moves, the number of cubes must be odd.
3. **Constraints**: Both `n` and `m` are between 1 and 100.

### Program Analysis
The provided program checks if `n >= m`. If this condition is true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Annotations
The annotations confirm that the program reads `n` and `m` for each test case and checks if `n >= m`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

### Original Assessment
The original assessment suggests that the program is incorrect because it doesn't account for the parity of `n` and `m`. Specifically, it claims that `n` must be odd if `m` is not zero, which is not correct.

### Correctness Evaluation
Let's re-evaluate the logic:
- If `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the desired number of cubes, then:
  - If `n` is even, `m` must also be even because starting from 0, an even number of moves can only result in an even number of cubes.
  - If `n` is odd, `m` can be either even or odd because starting from 0, an odd number of moves can result in either an even or odd number of cubes.

### Conclusion
The provided program only checks if `n >= m`. This is not sufficient because it doesn't account for the parity of `n` and `m`. For example:
- If `n = 2` and `m = 1`, the program will print "Yes", but it's impossible to have 1 cube after 2 moves (since 2 is even and 1 is odd).
- If `n = 3` and `m = 1`, the program will print "Yes", which is correct because 3 is odd and 1 is odd.

Thus, the original assessment is correct in pointing out that the program does not fully account for the parity requirement. The correct condition should involve checking both the parity and the value of `n` and `m`.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
