Reasoning: 
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `m`. It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if the condition is true, otherwise it prints "No". However, this logic is not entirely correct for the problem description provided.

The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Each move can either add or remove a single cube. This means that the difference between `n` and `m` must be non-negative and even, because each pair of moves (one addition and one removal) results in no net change, and any remaining moves must be additions to reach `m` cubes.

The current program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is insufficient. For example, if `n` is 2 and `m` is 1, the program would output "Yes", but it's not possible to have exactly 1 cube after 2 moves because the only possible outcomes are 0 or 2 cubes.

The correct logic should be to check if `n - m` is non-negative and even.

Correctness: **False**
