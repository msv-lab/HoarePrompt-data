Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed.

The program checks if `n >= m` and if true, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". This logic is incorrect because Nikita can also achieve `m` cubes if `n >= m` and `n - m` is even. The reason is that if `n - m` is even, Nikita can perform a sequence of moves that involves adding and removing cubes in pairs, ending up with exactly `m` cubes.

For example:
- If `n = 4` and `m = 2`, the program would print "Yes" because `n >= m`. However, Nikita can achieve exactly 2 cubes by adding 2 cubes and then removing 2 cubes (or vice versa), which is valid as long as `n - m` is even.

A correct approach would be to check if `n >= m` and if `n - m` is even.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that Nikita can achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves if and only if `n >= m` and `n - m` is even.
