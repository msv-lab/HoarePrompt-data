The function `func_1` accepts no direct parameters but is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, where `1 <= n, m <= 100`. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each one. The specific functionality of how `n` and `m` are processed is not detailed, but the function is expected to handle up to 100 such test cases as specified by the integer `t`, where `1 <= t <= 100`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes up to 100 test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` within the range 1 to 100, and returns a result for each test case.**
