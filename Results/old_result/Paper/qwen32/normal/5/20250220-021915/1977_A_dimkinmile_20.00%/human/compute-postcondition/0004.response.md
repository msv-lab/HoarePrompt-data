The given initial state describes the variables and conditions for a program that involves multiple test cases. Specifically, `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are two integers `n` and `m` where `n` is less than `m`. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is simply `print('No')`.

This means that regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`, the print statement will output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
