You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function determines whether the sum of elements in the subarray of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) is less than the cumulative sum of values `x` (where `x` is 1 if the element is greater than 1, otherwise 2) for the same subarray. It prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Good Array Condition**:
    - There exists an integer array `b` of the same length `m` as the subarray `a` such that:
        1. Sum of elements in `a` equals the sum of elements in `b`.
        2. For every index `i`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.
        3. Every element in `b` is greater than 0.

2. **Input**:
    - `t`: Number of test cases.
    - For each test case:
        - `n`: Length of the array `c`.
        - `q`: Number of queries.
        - `c`: The array of integers.
        - `q` lines of queries, each specifying a subarray `c[l_i]` to `c[r_i]`.

3. **Output**:
    - For each query, print "YES" if the subarray is good, otherwise "NO".

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to determine if a subarray is good by checking two conditions:
1. The sum of the subarray `a` should be less than the sum of the subarray `b`.
2. The subarray should not be a single element (`x != y`).

The program constructs the array `b` such that each element is either 1 (if the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1) or 2 (if the corresponding element in `a` is 1). This ensures that `b` is always greater than `a` element-wise and all elements in `b` are positive.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Condition 1**:
    - The program checks if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]`. This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `a` is less than the sum of the subarray `b`. However, the condition should be `a[y] - a[x - 1] == b[y] - b[x - 1]` to satisfy the first condition of a good array.

2. **Condition 2**:
    - The program checks if `x != y` to ensure the subarray is not a single element. This is correct for the second condition of a good array.

### Correctness:
Given the above issues, the program does not correctly implement the conditions for a good array. Specifically, the sum condition is not checked properly.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1
1 2 3
1 3
```
- The subarray is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The program constructs `b` as `[0, 2, 1, 1]` (since `a[1] = 1`, `a[2] = 2`, `a[3] = 3`).
- The sum of the subarray `a` is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
- The sum of the subarray `b` is `2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.
- The program will output "NO" because `6 < 4` is false, but it should be checking `6 == 4` which is also false, but the correct check should be `6 == 4 + (some adjustment)` to ensure the sums are equal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the conditions for determining if a subarray is good. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
