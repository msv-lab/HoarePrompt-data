The given code snippet updates the `b` list at index `i` by adding `x` to the value at index `i-1`. Here's the output state after the execution of the code:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5; The array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9; For each query `i`, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are integers read from the input; `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `b[1]` to `b[i]` and `b[i]` has been updated to `b[i - 1] + x`; `x` is 1 if `a[n] > 1` else 2; `i` is `n`.**
