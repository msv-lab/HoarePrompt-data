Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, the array `c` is a list of `n` integers where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^9, for each query `i`, `l_i` and `r_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5 and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements up to that index from the original `a`, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `x` from `b[1]` to `b[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, where `x` is 1 if `a[i] > 1` else 2, `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input**.

In natural language: The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Two new variables `x` and `y` are introduced and assigned the integer values from the input.
