You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if a subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` of an array `c` is "good".
- A subarray is "good" if there exists an array `b` of the same length such that:
  1. The sum of elements in the subarray `c` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
  2. No element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in `c`.
  3. All elements in `b` are positive.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program initializes the input reading correctly, parsing the number of test cases and, for each test case, the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `c` itself.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program creates a prefix sum array `a` for the input array `c`. The prefix sum array `a` is used to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray of `c`.
   - The program also creates a prefix sum array `b` where each element `b[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of an array where each element is either `1` (if the corresponding element in `c` is greater than `1`) or `2` (if the corresponding element in `c` is `1`). This is intended to simulate the minimum possible sum of a valid `b` array for the subarray.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` (using the prefix sum array `a`) is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b` (using the prefix sum array `b`).
   - The program also checks if `l_i == r_i` (i.e., the subarray has only one element). If the subarray has only one element, it will print "NO" (which is correct since a single element subarray cannot satisfy the conditions for being "good" unless `c[l_i] > 1` and we can choose `b[l_i] = 1`).

4. **Condition Checking:**
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is used to check if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i:r_i+1]` is less than the minimum possible sum of a valid `b` array for the same subarray. If this condition is true, the subarray cannot be "good", so the program prints "NO".
   - If the condition is false, the program prints "YES", assuming that the subarray can be "good". However, this is not entirely correct because the program does not ensure that `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i` in the subarray.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly ensure that `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i` in the subarray. The logic for constructing `b` only ensures that `b[i]` is either `1` or `2`, but it does not prevent `b[i]` from being equal to `c[i]` if `c[i]` is `1` or `2`.
- The program does not handle the case where `c[l_i:r_i+1]` has a single element correctly. If `c[l_i:r_i+1]` has a single element and that element is greater than `1`, the subarray can still be "good" by choosing `b[l_i] = 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
