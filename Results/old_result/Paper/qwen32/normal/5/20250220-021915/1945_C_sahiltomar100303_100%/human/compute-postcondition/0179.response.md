The code snippet `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. 

Given the initial state, `trightZero` is either 2 (if the current character `s[i]` is '0') or 0 (if the current character `s[i]` is not '0'), and then incremented by 1. Therefore, after the increment, `trightZero` will be either 3 or 1.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `rightZero` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 0, now incremented by 1; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `rightOne` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` including the current character if it is '0'; `trightZero` is either 3 or 1; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is 1 if the current character `s[i]` is not '0', otherwise `trightOne` is 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.
