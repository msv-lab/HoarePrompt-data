The value of `mid` is updated to be the integer division of `n` by 2. All other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 1.**
