Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is `mid + 1` and `mid < n - 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` and `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`**

In simple terms, the only change is that `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1 while all other conditions and values remain the same.
