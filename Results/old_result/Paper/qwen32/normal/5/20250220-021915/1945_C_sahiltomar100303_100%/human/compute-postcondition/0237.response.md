Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is increased by 1 and must be less than `n-1`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The string `s` remains unchanged. The variable `right` is increased by 1 and still must be less than `n-1`. The condition that `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2` is still in effect. The variable `tleftOne` is increased by 1. The variable `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
