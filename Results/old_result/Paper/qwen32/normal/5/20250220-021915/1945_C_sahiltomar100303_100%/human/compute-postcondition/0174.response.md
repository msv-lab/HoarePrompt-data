Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `rightOne` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s`; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s`; `trightOne` is 0; `s[i]` is not '0'**

Natural language: The variable `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
