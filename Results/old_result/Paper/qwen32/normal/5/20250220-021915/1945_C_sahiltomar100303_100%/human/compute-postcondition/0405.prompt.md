Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if left != 0:
            print(left)
        elif tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 1. If `left` is 0, then the condition remains as is. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the condition remains unchanged. If `right` equals `n`, then `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 or less than (n + 1) // 2. If `left` is not 0, then `left` remains not equal to 0. If `left` is 0 and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2. If `right` does not equal `n`, the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `left` is compared to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `right`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true. If `left` is 0, the counts `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` remain as described in the precondition. If `right` equals `n` and `left` is 0, `trightOne` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` with no additional changes, or `trightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` up to `right`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` up to `right`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` up to `right`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` up to `right`, and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, or the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` is less than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is either `n` or not `n`, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in `s` up to `right = n - 1`. If `left` is 0 and `right` was not equal to `n` before the if-else block, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is 0 and `right` was equal to `n` before the if-else block, `rightOne` is adjusted to be less than `(n + 1) // 2` if it was less than that value, otherwise it remains adjusted to be at least `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is not 0, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, and if `right` is `n` and `left` is 0, `tleftZero` meets or exceeds the threshold `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` is not `n`, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is compared to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, and the condition in the if part holds if the former is less than or equal to the latter.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
