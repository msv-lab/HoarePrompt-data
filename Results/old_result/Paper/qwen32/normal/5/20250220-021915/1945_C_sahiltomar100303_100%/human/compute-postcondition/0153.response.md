Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 0; and the `i`-th character of `s` is not '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `leftOne` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
