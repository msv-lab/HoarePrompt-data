The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `s` and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s[right]` is '0', `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the bounds of `s` where the character at position `right` is '0', and `tleftZero` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`s[right]` is '0', `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the bounds of `s` where the character at position `right` is '0', `tleftZero` is increased by 1**.
