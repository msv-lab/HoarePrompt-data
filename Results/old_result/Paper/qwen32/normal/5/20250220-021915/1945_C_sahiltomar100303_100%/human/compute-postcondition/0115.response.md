Postcondition: **t is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4; n is 2; s is "10"; mid is 1; leftZero is 0; rightZero is 1; leftOne is 0; rightOne is 1; left is 0; leftMove is 0; right is 2; tleftZero is 1; trightZero is 0; tleftOne is 0; trightOne is 1; right is equal to n. If rightOne is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then rightOne remains greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, rightOne is less than (n + 1) // 2.**
