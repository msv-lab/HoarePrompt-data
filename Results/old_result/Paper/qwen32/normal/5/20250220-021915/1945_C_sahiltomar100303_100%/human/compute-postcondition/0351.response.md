The provided code snippet is just an assignment statement that sets the variable `right` to the value of `mid`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `mid`. Since `mid` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. Therefore, we can only state that `right` will be assigned the value of `mid`.

Output State: **`left` is 0; `leftZero` will be adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`; `rightOne` will be adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`; `right` is `mid`.**
