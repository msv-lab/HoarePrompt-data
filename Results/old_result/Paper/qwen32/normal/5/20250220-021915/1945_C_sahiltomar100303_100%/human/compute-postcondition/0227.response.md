The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`s`, `right`, `n`, `trightOne`) remain unchanged. The preconditions that `right` is increased by 1, `right` must be less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` must be increased or `trightOne` must be increased to satisfy the loop condition are still valid. The only change is that `tleftZero` has been incremented.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is increased by 1, `right` must be less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` must be increased or `trightOne` must be increased to satisfy the loop condition; `tleftZero` is increased by 1.**
