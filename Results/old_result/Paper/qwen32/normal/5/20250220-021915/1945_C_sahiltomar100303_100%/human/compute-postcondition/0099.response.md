Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 1; `left` is 0; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 1; `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
