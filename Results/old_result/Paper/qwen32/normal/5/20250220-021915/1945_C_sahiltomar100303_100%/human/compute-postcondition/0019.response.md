Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input and must be at least 2; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0; `i` is 0; `s[i]` is not '0'**.

Natural Language: The value of `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
