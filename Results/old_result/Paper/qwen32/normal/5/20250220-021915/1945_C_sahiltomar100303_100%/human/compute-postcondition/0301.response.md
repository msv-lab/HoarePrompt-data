Output State: **`right` is the smallest index where both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true; `n` is greater than 1; `s` is the input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 1; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is either 2 or 3; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 1; `trightOne` is 1; `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, so if it was 1, it becomes 2, and if it was 2, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
