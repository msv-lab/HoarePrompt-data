Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that `leftZero >= 0`, `rightOne` is adjusted such that `rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2`, `right` is `mid + 1` and `mid < n`, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `trightOne` is decremented by 1 and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, so `right` becomes `mid + 1`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
