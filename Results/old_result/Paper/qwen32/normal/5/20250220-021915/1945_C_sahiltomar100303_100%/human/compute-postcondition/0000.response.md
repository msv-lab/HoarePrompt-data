The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input. This integer represents the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `a` (which are specific to each test case) remain unchanged by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
