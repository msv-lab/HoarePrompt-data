Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer greater than 0; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` after all iterations; `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` after all iterations; `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` after all iterations; `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` after all iterations; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is `mid`; `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first half of `s` after all iterations; `trightZero` is the count of '0's in the second half of `s` after all iterations; `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first half of `s` after all iterations; `trightOne` is the count of '1's in the second half of `s` after all iterations; `left` is 0.**

The value of `right` has been updated to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
