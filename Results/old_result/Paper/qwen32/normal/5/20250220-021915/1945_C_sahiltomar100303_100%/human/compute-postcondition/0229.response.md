The code snippet `tleftOne += 1` increments the variable `tleftOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `right` is increased by 1, `right` must be less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` must be increased or `trightOne` must be increased to satisfy the loop condition still holds. The only change is in the value of `tleftOne`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is increased by 1, `right` must be less than `n`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, and either `tleftZero` must be increased or `trightOne` must be increased to satisfy the loop condition.**
