Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `left` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; `leftZero` is -1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 3 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 2; `leftOne` is 0 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is -1; `rightOne` is either 1 or 2 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` is either 2 or 3; `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is 1; `trightOne` is 0.**
