Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

We are given the following initial state:
- `t` is an integer read from input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\).
- `n` is 2.
- `s` is "10".
- `mid` is 1.
- `leftZero` is 0.
- `rightZero` is 1.
- `leftOne` is 0.
- `rightOne` is 1.
- `left` is equal to 0.
- `leftMove` is 0.
- `right` is 2.
- `tleftZero` is 1.
- `trightZero` is 0.
- `tleftOne` is 0.
- `trightOne` is 1.
- `right` equals `n`.
- `left` is equal to 0.
- `tleftZero` is less than \((n + 1) // 2\).

The print statement is:
```python
print(left)
```

From the initial state, we can see that `left` is explicitly defined as 0.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `left`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
