The code snippet `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Given the initial state, `tleftOne` can either be 0 or 1. After the increment, `tleftOne` will be either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input and must be at least 2; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is 1; `leftZero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 2 if the character at index `i` of `s` is '1', otherwise `leftOne` is 1; `rightOne` is 0; `tleftZero` is 1 if the character at index `i` of `s` is '0', otherwise `tleftZero` is 0; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is either 1 or 2; `trightOne` is 0.**
