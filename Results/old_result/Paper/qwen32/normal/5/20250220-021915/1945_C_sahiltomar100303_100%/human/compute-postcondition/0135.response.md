Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is 2; `s` is "10"; `mid` is 1; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftOne` is 0; `rightOne` is 1; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `tleftZero` is 1; `trightZero` is 0; `tleftOne` is 0; `trightOne` is 1. If `left` is 0, then the condition remains as is. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the condition remains unchanged. If `right` equals `n`, then `rightOne` is either greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 or less than (n + 1) // 2. If `left` is not 0, then `left` remains not equal to 0. If `left` is 0 and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, then `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2. If `right` does not equal `n`, the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `left` is compared to the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `right`.**
