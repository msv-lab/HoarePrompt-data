Postcondition: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 2 * 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2; `s` is the new input string; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftMove` is 0; `right` is 2; `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, and `leftZero` is 1. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`, `trightOne` is 0, and `leftOne` is `leftOne + 1`.**
