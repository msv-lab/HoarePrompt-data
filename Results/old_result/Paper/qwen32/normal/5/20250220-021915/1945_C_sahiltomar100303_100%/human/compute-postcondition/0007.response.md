The code snippet provided initializes the variable `leftOne` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the initial state of the variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, and `rightZero` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input such that 1 <= `t` <= 2 * 10^4; `n` is an integer read from input; `s` is a string read from input; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0; `rightZero` is 0; `leftOne` is 0.**
