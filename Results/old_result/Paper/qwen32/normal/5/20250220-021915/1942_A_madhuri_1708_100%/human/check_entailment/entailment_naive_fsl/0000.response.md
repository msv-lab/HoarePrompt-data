Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

1. **Case when `k == 1`:**
   - The program prints the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` which is always sorted. However, this array has only one sorted cyclic shift (the array itself), not exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. For `k == 1` and `n > 1`, the program should print an array that has exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

2. **Case when `k == n`:**
   - The program correctly prints an array where all elements are the same (e.g., `[k, k, ..., k]`). This array has exactly `n` sorted cyclic shifts, which is correct.

3. **Case when `2 <= k < n`:**
   - The program prints `-1` for all cases where `k` is not equal to `1` or `n`. However, there are valid arrays that can have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for `2 <= k < n`. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2]`.

### Counterexample:
For the input `3 2`, the program outputs `-1`, but a valid output could be `1 2 1` or `2 1 2`, both of which have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The program does not cover all valid cases for `2 <= k < n` and incorrectly handles the case when `k == 1` for `n > 1`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
