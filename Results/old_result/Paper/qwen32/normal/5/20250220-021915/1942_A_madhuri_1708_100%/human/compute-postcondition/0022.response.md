Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and there are at least `t` lines in the input where the first line is `t` and the subsequent `t` lines are the inputs for each test case; `s` is the next line in the input file; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting and converting the new string `s`. Regardless of whether `n` equals `k` or not, the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
