You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks to construct an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.

- **Cyclic Shift**: A cyclic shift of an array `a` means rotating the array. For example, the cyclic shifts of `[1, 2, 3]` are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]`.
- **Sorted Array**: An array is sorted if each element is less than or equal to the next element.
- **Constraints**: 
  - `1 <= a_i <= 10^9` for each `i`.
  - `1 <= k <= n <= 1000`.
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 1000.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to solve the problem as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: It reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Handling Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: If `k >= 2`:
     - If `n == k`, it outputs an array with `k` identical elements (all equal to `k`).
     - If `n != k`, it outputs `-1`.
   - **Case 2**: If `k < 2`:
     - It outputs an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is a sorted array.

### Correctness Evaluation

Let's evaluate the correctness of the program for different cases:

1. **Case 1: `k >= 2`**
   - **Sub-case 1.1: `n == k`**
     - The program outputs an array with `k` identical elements. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 3`, it outputs `[3, 3, 3]`.
     - All cyclic shifts of `[3, 3, 3]` are `[3, 3, 3]`, which is sorted.
     - This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - **Sub-case 1.2: `n != k`**
     - The program outputs `-1`.
     - If `n > k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts because having `n` elements with `k` sorted shifts would require a specific arrangement that the program does not handle.
     - If `n < k`, it is also impossible because `k` cannot be greater than the number of cyclic shifts.
     - The program correctly identifies these impossible cases and outputs `-1`.

2. **Case 2: `k < 2`**
   - The program outputs a sorted array `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - Only the first cyclic shift (the array itself) is sorted.
   - This satisfies the condition that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted when `k = 1`.

### Conclusion

The program handles all possible cases as per the problem description and outputs the correct results for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
