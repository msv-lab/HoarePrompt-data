Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Case when \( k = 1 \)**: The program correctly generates an array for \( k = 1 \) by creating an array with elements from 1 to n, which ensures that only the first cyclic shift is sorted. However, this is not the only valid solution for \( k = 1 \). There could be other valid arrays as well.

2. **Case when \( k \geq 2 \)**: The program only handles the specific sub-case where \( n = k \) by creating an array with all elements equal to \( k \). However, this is not the only valid solution for \( k \geq 2 \). There could be other valid arrays that have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts.

3. **Case when \( k > n \)**: The program does not handle this case explicitly, although the problem constraints state \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), so this should not happen with valid input.

4. **General Case**: The program does not correctly address the general problem of finding an array with exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts.

To correctly solve this problem, we need a more comprehensive approach to construct the array based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k == 1:
            # For k = 1, we can use an array where the first element is the smallest
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])
        elif k == n:
            # For k = n, all elements must be the same
            print(*[1 for j in range(n)])
        elif k > n:
            # This case should not happen based on problem constraints, but handle it anyway
            print('-1')
        else:
            # For 1 < k < n, we can construct an array with a specific pattern
            # Example: [1, 2, ..., k, 10^9, 10^9, ..., 10^9] (n-k times 10^9)
            print(*(list(range(1, k + 1)) + [10**9] * (n - k)))

func()
```

This corrected version addresses the different cases and constructs valid arrays for each scenario.
