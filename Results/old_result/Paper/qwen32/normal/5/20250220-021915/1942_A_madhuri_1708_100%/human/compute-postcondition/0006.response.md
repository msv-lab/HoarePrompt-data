The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'-1'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `s`), but these variables are not referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this particular print statement.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
   - There are at least `t` lines in the input.
   - The first line of the input is `t`.
   - The subsequent `t` lines are the inputs for each test case.
   - `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting and converting the string `s`.
   - The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `n` is not equal to `k`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print('-1')` statement is executed.

Since the print statement does not use any of the variables described in the initial state, the output is simply the string `'-1'`.

Output: **-1**
