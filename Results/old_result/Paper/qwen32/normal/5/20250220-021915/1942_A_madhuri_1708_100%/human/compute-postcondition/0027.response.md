Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, given two integers `n` and `k`, it prints a sequence of numbers based on specific conditions: if `k` is 1, it prints numbers from 1 to `n`; if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints `k` repeated `k` times; otherwise, it prints `-1`.**
