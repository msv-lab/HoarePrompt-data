The `print('-1')` statement in the given Python code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string `-1`. The value to be printed is explicitly given as `-1` and does not depend on the variables `t`, `s`, `n`, or `k` in any way.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the context of the input and variables, including `t`, `s`, `n`, and `k`.
2. The `print('-1')` statement is independent of these variables and directly prints the string `-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
