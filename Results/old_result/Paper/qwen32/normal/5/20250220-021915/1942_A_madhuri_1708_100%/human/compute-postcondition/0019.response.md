The code snippet splits the string `s` into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns these integers to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `s` is the next line in the input file and that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with at least `t` lines following the first line. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the input lines for the test cases are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^3, and there are at least `t` lines in the input where the first line is `t` and the subsequent `t` lines are the inputs for each test case; `s` is the next line in the input file; `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting and converting the new string `s`.**
