The code snippet `line = input('')` prompts the user for input and assigns this input to the variable `line`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is an input integer; `line` is the input string provided by the user.**
