The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string `line`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1000 and `1000 + T[0]`, `i` is 2, `result` is a string that is the space-separated representation of the list `a`, `line` is the input string.**
