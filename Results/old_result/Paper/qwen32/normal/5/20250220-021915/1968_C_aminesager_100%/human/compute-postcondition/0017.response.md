Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string line; `a` is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2] + T[n-1]; `i` is `n`; `result` is a string that is the space-separated representation of the list `a`.**

Natural language: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
