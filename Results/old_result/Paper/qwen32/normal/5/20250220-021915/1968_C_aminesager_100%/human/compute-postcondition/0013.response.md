Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases minus 1, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; n is an input integer and must be greater than 1; T is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the input string line; a is a list containing the integers 1000, 1000 + T[0], 1000 + T[0] + T[1], ..., 1000 + T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2] + T[n-1]; i is n**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements. The first element is `1000`, and each subsequent element is `1000` plus the cumulative sum of the integers in the list `T` up to that point. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes executing.
