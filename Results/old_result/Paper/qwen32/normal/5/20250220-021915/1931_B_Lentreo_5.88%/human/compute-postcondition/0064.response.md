Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times. For each test case, `curr` is the sum of `i - last` for all non-zero `i` in `nums`, where `last` is the last element of `nums`. If `curr` is 0, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged throughout the loop except within the scope of each iteration.**

In simpler terms, the loop runs `t` times, and for each iteration, it calculates `curr` as the sum of differences between each non-zero element `i` in the list `nums` and the last element `last` of `nums`. If `curr` turns out to be 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` do not change outside the loop but are reset for each iteration.
