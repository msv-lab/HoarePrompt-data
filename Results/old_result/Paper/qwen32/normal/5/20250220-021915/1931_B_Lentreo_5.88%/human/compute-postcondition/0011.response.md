Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the next element in `nums`, `curr` is updated to `curr + i - last`**

In simpler terms, `curr` has been updated by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
