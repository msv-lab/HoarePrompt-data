The code provided only reassigns the value of `last` to be the last element of the list `nums`. The other variables (`nums`, `curr`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is the list of integers from the input; `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`; `last` is the last element of `nums`; `t` is unchanged; `n` is an input integer.**
