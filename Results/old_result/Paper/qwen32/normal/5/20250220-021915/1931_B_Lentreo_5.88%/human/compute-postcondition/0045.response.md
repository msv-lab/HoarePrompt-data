The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `nums`. This means that `nums` will now hold the new list of integers provided by the input, and the other variables (`curr`, `last`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is the list of integers from the input; `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`; `last` is the last element of `nums`; `t` is unchanged; `n` is an input integer.**
