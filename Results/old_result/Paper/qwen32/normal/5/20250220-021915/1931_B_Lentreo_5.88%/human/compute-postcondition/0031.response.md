The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `nums`. Therefore, we can only adjust `i` for the next iteration of the loop. According to the code, `i` takes on each value in the list `nums` one by one. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last element of `nums`.

To execute the loop one more time, there must be another element in `nums` to be assigned to `i`. However, we are given that at the end of the previous iteration, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and no information is provided suggesting that `nums` has more than one element. Therefore, we assume that the loop is about to terminate because there are no more elements in `nums` to iterate over.

If we consider the possibility that `nums` has more than one element and we are not yet at the end of the list, then `i` should be the next element in the list.

Given the information provided and assuming there is another element in `nums` to iterate over, here is the adjusted state:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums`**.

However, if `nums` has only one element and the loop is about to terminate, then the state would remain the same in terms of `nums`, but `i` would not be defined for the next iteration. Since the task specifies to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head and the loop is about to terminate, we can conclude:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element**.

But if we strictly follow the task to adjust for the next iteration assuming there is another element:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `nums`**.
