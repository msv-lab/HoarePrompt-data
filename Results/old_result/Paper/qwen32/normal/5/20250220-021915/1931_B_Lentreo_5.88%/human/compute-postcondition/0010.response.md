The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the list `nums`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to the next element in the list `nums`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element
- `last` is the last element of `nums`
- If `i` is not 0, `curr` is set to `i - last`. Otherwise, `curr` remains 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in the list `nums`.

Let's denote the current index of `i` in `nums` as `index`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `nums[index]`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `nums[index + 1]`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `index` from the previous state, we can only say that `i` should be the next element in `nums` after the current `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the next element in `nums` after the current `i`**.

However, to be more precise, let's assume that `i` was `nums[k]` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `nums[k+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is `nums[k+1]` where `i` was `nums[k]` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since we don't have the exact index `k`, we can simply denote the next element as the next one in `nums` after the current `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `i` is the next element in `nums`**.
