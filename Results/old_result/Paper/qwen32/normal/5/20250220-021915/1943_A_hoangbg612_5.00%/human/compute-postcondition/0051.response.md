To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states for the first three iterations.

The loop iterates `cur` times, and in each iteration, it checks if `M[i] <= i`. If this condition is met, `cur` is set to `i` and the loop breaks. If the condition is not met in any of the iterations, `cur` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop runs `cur` times.
- For each iteration `i` from 0 to `cur-1`, it checks if `M[i] <= i`.
- If `M[i] <= i` is true for any `i`, the loop breaks and `cur` is set to `i`.
- If `M[i] > i` for all `i` from 0 to `cur-1`, `cur` remains unchanged.

The loop will continue to execute until it either breaks due to the condition `M[i] <= i` being true or completes all `cur` iterations without breaking.

**Output State:**
- `T` remains greater than 0.
- `S` remains the input integer.
- `N` remains the sorted list of integers.
- `cur` will be the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or if no such `i` exists within the range, `cur` will remain unchanged from its initial value.

In simpler terms, after all iterations:
- The value of `cur` will be the smallest index `i` for which `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, or it will remain the same if no such index is found within the range of the loop.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers; `cur` is the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or it remains unchanged if no such `i` is found.**
