Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of `1` and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, the count of `num` in `M` is incremented by 1.**
