The value of `cur` is updated to the value of `num`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**
