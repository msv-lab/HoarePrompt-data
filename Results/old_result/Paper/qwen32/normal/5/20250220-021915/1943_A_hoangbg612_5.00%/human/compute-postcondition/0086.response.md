To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop given the initial conditions and the outputs after the first three iterations.

### Initial State Recap:
- `T` is `T-1` (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
- `S` is an input integer (remains unchanged throughout the loop).
- `N` is a sorted list of integers.
- `cur` is -1.
- `M` is an empty dictionary.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each number `num` in the sorted list `N`.

1. **First Iteration:**
   - If `num` is greater than `cur` (which is -1), `M` is updated to `{num: 1}` and `cur` is set to `num`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1` (which is 0), `cur` is incremented to 0 and the loop breaks.
   - If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, `M` is updated to `{-1: 1}` and `cur` remains -1.

2. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M[cur]` is set to 1 and `cur` is updated to `num`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the loop breaks.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, the count of `num` in `M` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, the loop will have processed every element in the sorted list `N`.

- `T` remains `T-1`.
- `S` remains the input integer.
- `N` remains the sorted list of integers.
- `cur` will be the last `num` that was processed by the loop.
- `M` will contain the count of consecutive integers starting from the smallest integer in `N`.

### Detailed Final Output State:
- All elements in `N` will be processed.
- If the numbers in `N` are consecutive, `M` will have keys as the numbers in `N` and all values will be 1.
- If there are gaps between numbers in `N`, `M` will have keys as the consecutive numbers starting from the smallest number in `N`, and the values will reflect the counts of these numbers in `N`.
- `cur` will be the last number in `N` if there are no breaks due to `num > cur + 1`.

### Example:
If `N` is `[1, 2, 3, 5]`, the final `M` will be `{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}` and `cur` will be `5`.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is the sorted list of integers, `cur` is the last number processed in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`.**
