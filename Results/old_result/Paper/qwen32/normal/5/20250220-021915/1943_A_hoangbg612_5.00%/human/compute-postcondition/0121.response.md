Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary. If `num > cur`, then `M` has one entry `{cur: 1}` and `cur` is set to `num`. If `num > cur + 1`, `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1. If `num <= cur`, then `M` has one entry `{-1: 1}` and `cur` remains -1.**
