To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to carefully analyze the logic it uses to compute the MEX of the array `c` after the game described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program starts by sorting the array `N`. This sorting step is crucial because it allows the program to efficiently find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` by iterating through the sorted array.

2. **Tracking Counts and Current MEX**: The program uses a dictionary `M` to keep track of how many times each number appears in the array `N`. It also keeps a variable `cur` to track the current MEX. The program iterates through the sorted array and updates `cur` based on the counts of numbers.

3. **Determining the MEX**: The program checks if the count of the current number `num` is less than or equal to `num`. If it is, it means that `num` can be part of the array `c` up to `num` times without affecting the MEX. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means there is a gap, and the MEX is `cur + 1`. The program also checks if the sum of the counts of numbers in `M` equals `S` (the size of the array `N`). If it does, it means all numbers up to `cur` are fully used, and the MEX is `cur + 1`.

4. **Final Adjustment**: The program then iterates from `0` to `cur` to check if any number `i` has a count less than or equal to `i`. If such a number is found, it sets `cur` to `i` as the MEX.

### Correctness Evaluation

The program's logic seems to be designed to find the MEX of the array `c` after the game, assuming both players play optimally. However, there are a few points to consider:

- **Optimal Play**: The program does not explicitly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the counts of numbers in the array. This approach is valid because the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob can be deduced from the counts of numbers. Alice will try to maximize the MEX by choosing numbers that do not immediately reduce the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it by choosing numbers that do reduce the MEX.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when all numbers are the same, when the array contains consecutive numbers starting from 0, and when there are gaps in the numbers.

- **Efficiency**: The program sorts the array, which takes O(n log n) time, and then iterates through it, which takes O(n) time. This is efficient given the constraints.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to correctly compute the MEX of the array `c` after the game, assuming both players play optimally.

### Conclusion

**Correctness: True**
