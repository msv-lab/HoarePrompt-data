The code snippet `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` to `cur`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `cur` will also be 0 after this assignment. Other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `cur` before the assignment, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, and `cur` is 0, `i` is 0**.
