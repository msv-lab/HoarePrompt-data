The code snippet `cur += 1` increments the value of the variable `cur` by 1. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, `num`) are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is `T-1`
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements
- `M` is a dictionary
- `num` is the next element in `N`

The only change is to the variable `cur`, which is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is increased by 1**.
