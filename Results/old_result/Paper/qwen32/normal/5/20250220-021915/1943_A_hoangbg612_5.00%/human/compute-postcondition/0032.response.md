The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value at the index `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables, except for the specific value in the dictionary `M` at the key `cur`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 2 integers; `num` is the next integer in `N`; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
