Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a. The array a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5; `T` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    for i in range(cur):
        if M[i] <= i:
            cur = i
            break
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - `T` remains greater than 0.
- `S` remains the input integer.
- `N` remains the sorted list of integers.
- `cur` will be the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or if no such `i` exists within the range, `cur` will remain unchanged from its initial value.

In simpler terms, after all iterations:
- The value of `cur` will be the smallest index `i` for which `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, or it will remain the same if no such index is found within the range of the loop.

Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `S` is an input integer, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, and `cur` is the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, or it remains the initial `cur` if no such `i` is found within the range of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `cur` will be the smallest integer `i` such that `M[i] <= i`, if such an `i` exists and is less than the initial `cur`. If no such `i` exists, `cur` remains unchanged from its initial value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
