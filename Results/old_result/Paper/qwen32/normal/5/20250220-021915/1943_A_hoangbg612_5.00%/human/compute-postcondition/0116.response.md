Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is an empty dictionary; `num` is an integer such that `num > cur`. If `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**
