To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(cur)`. This means that only `i` and `cur` can be adjusted.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0.
- `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `cur` is 0 if `M[i] <= i`, otherwise `cur` remains greater than 0.
- `i` is 0. If `M[i] <= i`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The loop `for i in range(cur)` will execute if `cur` is greater than 0. Since `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` should be 1 if `cur` is at least 1.

Let's analyze the conditions:
- If `M[i] <= i` at the end of the previous iteration, `cur` would have been set to 0, and the loop would not execute again.
- If `M[i] > i` at the end of the previous iteration, `cur` would remain greater than 0, and the loop would execute again with `i` incremented by 1.

Given `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again:
- `cur` must be greater than 0.
- `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, the last number processed in `N` is at least 0, `M` is a dictionary with keys as consecutive integers starting from the smallest number in `N` and values as their counts in `N`, `S` is an input integer, `cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**.
