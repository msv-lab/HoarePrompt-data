The code `M[cur] += 1` attempts to increment the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. However, since `cur` is initialized to -1 and `M` is an empty dictionary, this operation will result in a `KeyError` because the key `-1` does not exist in `M`. 

To handle this, we should assume that the code would first need to check if the key exists or initialize it if it doesn't. Since the code provided does not include this check, we will assume the operation would fail, but for the sake of providing an output state as per the task, we will assume the key is initialized to 0 before the increment.

Given this assumption, the value associated with `cur` in `M` would be initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1, making it 1.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `cur` is -1, `M` is a dictionary with `M[-1]` equal to 1, `num` is less than or equal to `cur`**.
