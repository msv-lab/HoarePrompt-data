The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If there are more elements in `N`, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is the next element in `N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must have another element after `num`.

State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least two elements, `M` is a dictionary, `num` is the next element in `N`**
