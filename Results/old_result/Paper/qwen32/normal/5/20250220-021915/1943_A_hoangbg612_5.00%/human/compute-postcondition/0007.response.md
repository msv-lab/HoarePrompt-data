The only object in the loop head is the variable `num`, which iterates over the list `N`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `N`. If the list `N` has at least one integer, the loop will execute.

Given the initial state, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input. To ensure the loop executes, `N` must contain at least one integer. The variables `T`, `S`, `cur`, and `M` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`T` must be greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `cur` is -1; `M` is an empty dictionary**
