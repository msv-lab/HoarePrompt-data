The code snippet `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. This changes the value of `cur` but does not affect the values of `N`, `S`, `M`, or the condition related to `num` and `cur` unless `num > cur + 1` was true before the assignment.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `cur` now holds the value of `num`. The condition `num > cur + 1` is no longer directly relevant because `cur` has been updated to equal `num`.

Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is an empty dictionary; `num` is an integer such that `num > cur`. If `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` is set to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1. `cur` is now equal to `num`.**
