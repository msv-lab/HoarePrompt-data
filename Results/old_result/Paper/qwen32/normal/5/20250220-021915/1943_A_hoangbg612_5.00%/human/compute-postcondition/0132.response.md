Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element; `S` is an input integer; `M` is a dictionary; `num` is the next element in the list `N` after the current `num`; `cur` is `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `N`, `S`, `M`, `num`, and the expression for `cur` remain unchanged except that the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
