The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The value of `cur` is `num` initially, and since no other operations are performed on `cur` in the provided snippet, `cur` remains `num`. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `num`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `cur` is `num`; `M` is a dictionary with the key `num` having the value `1`; `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is updated to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1.**
