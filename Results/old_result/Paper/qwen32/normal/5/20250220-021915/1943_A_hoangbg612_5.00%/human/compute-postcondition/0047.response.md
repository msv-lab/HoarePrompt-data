To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `cur`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `cur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `T` is greater than 0
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a sorted list of integers
- `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has been incremented)
- If `M[i] <= i`, then `cur` is set to `i + 1` and the loop breaks; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

Let's analyze the state adjustments required for the next iteration:

1. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.
2. **`cur`**: The value of `cur` depends on the condition `M[i] <= i`. If the condition was true, the loop would have broken, and `cur` would have been set to `i + 1`. If the condition was false, `cur` remains unchanged. Since we are considering the scenario where the loop is about to execute again, the condition `M[i] <= i` must have been false, and `cur` remains the same.

Since the loop will execute again, `i` must be less than `cur`. Given that `i` has just been incremented, it must be less than `cur` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `cur` remains unchanged**.

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1` and `cur` will be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `k + 1`, `cur` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since the exact value of `cur` is not specified in the problem statement, we can generalize:
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `cur` remains unchanged**.
