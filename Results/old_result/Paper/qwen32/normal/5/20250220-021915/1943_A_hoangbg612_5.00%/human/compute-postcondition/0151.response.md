The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cur`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `cur`. If `i` is less than `cur`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value that would allow the loop to continue executing, which is the current value of `i` plus 1. The value of `cur` should remain the same unless the loop condition is no longer satisfied.

Given the conditions:
- If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` is set to the incremented value of `i` and the loop breaks.
- Otherwise, no further changes are made to `cur` and `i` is still incremented by 1.

Since we are considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume that the loop has not yet broken, meaning `M[i]` is greater than `i`. Therefore, `cur` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`cur` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1** (meaning `i` is now the value it had at the end of the last iteration plus 1)
