To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

Initial State: 
- `T` is `T-1`
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element
- `M` is a dictionary
- `num` is the next element in `N`

The code snippet:
```python
M[cur] += 1
```

Here, `cur` is not defined in the initial state, which means the code will raise a `NameError` because `cur` is not a known variable. However, assuming `cur` is intended to be `num` (the next element in `N`), the code will increment the count of `num` in the dictionary `M`.

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with the count of `num` incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in `N`.**

This means the value associated with the key `num` in the dictionary `M` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
