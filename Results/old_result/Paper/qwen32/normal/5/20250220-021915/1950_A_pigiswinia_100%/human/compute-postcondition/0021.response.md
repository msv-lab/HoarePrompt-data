The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'STAIR'`. This string is explicitly defined in the `print` statement and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `i`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('STAIR')`, which means it will output the string `'STAIR'` exactly as specified.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:

Output: **STAIR**
