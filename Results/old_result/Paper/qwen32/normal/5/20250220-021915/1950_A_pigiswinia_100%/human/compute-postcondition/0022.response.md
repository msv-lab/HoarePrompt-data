The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are new integers obtained from the input.
- `i` is set to 5.

Since the `print` statement is `print('PEAK')`, it will simply output the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`.

Output: **PEAK**
