The provided initial state describes several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`), but the print statement in the code snippet does not use any of these variables. Instead, it simply prints the string 'PEAK'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i`, but none of these variables are referenced in the print statement.
2. The print statement `print('PEAK')` is a straightforward instruction to output the string 'PEAK'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is simply the string 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
