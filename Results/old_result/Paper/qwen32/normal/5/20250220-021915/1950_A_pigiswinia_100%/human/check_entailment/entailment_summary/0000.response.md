Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given three digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or neither. The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions:
- If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
- If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
- Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

These conditions accurately reflect the problem description. The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement. The execution summary also accurately describes the program's behavior.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
