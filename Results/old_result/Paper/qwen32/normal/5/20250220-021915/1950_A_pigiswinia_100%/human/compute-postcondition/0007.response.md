The initial state provides specific conditions about the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but the `print` statement does not depend on the values of these variables. Instead, it simply prints the string 'PEAK'.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
2. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input.
3. The condition states that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c` (i.e., `b > a` and `b > c`).

Given these conditions, the `print` statement will execute and output the string 'PEAK' regardless of the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as long as `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

Output: **PEAK**
