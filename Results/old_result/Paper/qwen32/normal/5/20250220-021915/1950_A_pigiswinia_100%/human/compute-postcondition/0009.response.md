The initial state describes the conditions on the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`:
- It is not the case that `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. This means that the sequence `a < b < c` does not hold.
- It is also not the case that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. This means that `b` is not the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Given these conditions, the only possible scenarios for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are:
1. `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal.
2. `a` is greater than `b` and `b` is greater than `c` (i.e., `a > b > c`).
3. `a` is greater than `b` but `b` is not greater than `c` (i.e., `a > b` and `b <= c`).
4. `b` is not greater than `a` but `b` is greater than `c` (i.e., `b <= a` and `b > c`).
5. `a` is not greater than `b` and `b` is not greater than `c` (i.e., `a <= b` and `b <= c`).

In all these scenarios, the print statement in the code will execute and print the string `'NONE'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **NONE**
