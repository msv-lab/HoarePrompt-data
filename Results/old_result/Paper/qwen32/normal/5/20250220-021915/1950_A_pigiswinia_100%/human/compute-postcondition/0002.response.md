The code snippet assigns the values of three integers from the input to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input.**
