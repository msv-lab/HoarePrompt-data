Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula used, `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`, does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the maximum number of fireworks that are visible at any given time, which involves considering the intervals during which fireworks from both installations are visible and overlapping. This requires a more complex approach, such as iterating through possible times or leveraging mathematical properties of the least common multiple (LCM).

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, denoted as `lcm_ab`.
2. For each installation, determine the number of fireworks launched within the interval `[0, m]`.
3. Consider the overlapping fireworks by examining the intervals `[0, m]` for both installations and the period `lcm_ab`.
4. Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to count the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        
        # Number of fireworks from the first installation
        A = m // a + 1
        # Number of fireworks from the second installation
        B = m // b + 1
        # Number of fireworks from both installations (overlap)
        AB = m // lcm_ab + 1
        
        # Maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        ans = A + B - AB
        print(ans)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously by considering the overlaps using the LCM and the inclusion-exclusion principle.
