Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 (This value does not directly affect the calculation of `ans`, so it can be ignored for the purpose of this print statement).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `qi` is `qi + 1` (This operation does not affect the calculation of `ans`, so it can be ignored for the purpose of this print statement).
- `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Calculation of `ans`:
The variable `ans` is computed using the formula:
\[ \text{ans} = \left(\frac{m}{a}\right) + \left(\frac{m}{b}\right) + 2 \]
where `//` denotes integer division (i.e., it discards the fractional part and returns only the integer quotient).

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans` which is the result of the integer division of `m` by `a`, added to the integer division of `m` by `b`, and then adding 2 to the sum.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is m // a + m // b + 2)**
