The given code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `qi` is incremented by 1. However, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not specified in the initial state, so they are read from the input in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input, `qi` is `qi + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` are now assigned the values read from the input. The variable `qi` has been incremented by 1.
