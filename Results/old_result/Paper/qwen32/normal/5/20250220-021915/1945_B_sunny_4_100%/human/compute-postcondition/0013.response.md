Let's break down the given information step by step to understand what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers read from the input.
- `qi` is `qi + 1`. Note that `qi` is not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- `ans` is defined as `m // a + m // b + 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`. Here's what each part of the expression represents:
- `m // a`: This is the integer division of `m` by `a`, which gives the quotient without the remainder.
- `m // b`: This is the integer division of `m` by `b`, which gives the quotient without the remainder.
- `2`: This is a constant value.

The final value of `ans` is the sum of these two integer divisions plus 2.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the `print(ans)` statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is m // a + m // b + 2)**
