Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time. Fireworks from two installations are launched at regular intervals and remain visible in the sky for `m + 1` minutes. The goal is to find the maximum number of overlapping fireworks at any given time.

### Key Points:
1. **Launch Intervals**: 
   - The first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes.
   - The second installation launches fireworks every `b` minutes.
   
2. **Visibility Duration**:
   - Each firework remains visible for `m + 1` minutes after its launch.
   
3. **Overlap Calculation**:
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the overlap of the intervals during which fireworks are visible.
   - For a given interval `[x, x + m]`, fireworks launched by the first installation at `x = ka` (where `k` is an integer) and by the second installation at `y = lb` (where `l` is an integer) will overlap if their intervals `[ka, ka + m]` and `[lb, lb + m]` intersect.
   - The number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the interval `[0, m]` is `floor(m/a) + 1`.
   - The number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the interval `[0, m]` is `floor(m/b) + 1`.

### Correct Formula:
The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks is:
\[ \text{max\_fireworks} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1 \]
The `+1` accounts for the possibility of fireworks being launched at the exact same time, which would be counted twice if we only added the two floor divisions.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program contains a few issues:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The program uses `m // a + m // b + 2` instead of `m // a + m // b + 1`. This results in an incorrect count of the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.
2. **Commented Code**: The program has a commented-out section that seems to contain the correct formula but is not used.

### Corrected Program:
The correct code should be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = m // a + m // b + 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the use of an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.

Correctness: **False**
