The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, and `a`, `b`, `m` are integers between 1 and 10^18. Additionally, `A` and `B` were initially calculated as `int(m/a) + 1` and `int(m/b) + 1`, respectively, but these calculations are based on the old values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

After the code snippet is executed, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the new integers read from the input. The values of `t`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the new integers read from the input, `A` is calculated as `int(m/a) + 1` based on the old values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `B` is calculated as `int(m/b) + 1` based on the old values of `a`, `b`, `m`.**
