Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

We are given two firework installations that launch fireworks at different frequencies, `a` and `b` minutes respectively. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes. The goal is to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible in the sky at the same time.

### Key Observations

1. **Visibility Period**: If a firework is launched at time `x`, it will be visible from `x` to `x + m`.
2. **Simultaneous Visibility**: We need to find a time where the maximum number of fireworks from both installations overlap.
3. **Counting Fireworks**:
   - The number of fireworks launched by the first installation that could be visible at some point within the visibility period is `floor(m/a) + 1`.
   - Similarly, for the second installation, it is `floor(m/b) + 1`.
   - However, the provided program adds `2` to the sum, which is incorrect.

### Program Analysis

The provided program calculates the number of fireworks visible from each installation as `m // a + 1` and `m // b + 1`, respectively. However, it then adds `2` to the sum, which is not justified by the problem statement.

### Correctness of the Program

The program incorrectly adds `2` to the sum of the two counts, which does not align with the problem's requirements. The correct approach should be to sum the two counts without adding `2`.

### Correct Implementation

The correct implementation should be:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        A = m // a + 1
        B = m // b + 1
        print(A + B)
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it adds `2` to the sum of the two counts, which is not justified by the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
