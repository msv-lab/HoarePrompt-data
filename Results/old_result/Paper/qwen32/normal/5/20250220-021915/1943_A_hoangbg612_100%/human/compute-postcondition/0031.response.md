The code assigns the value `1` to the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. The values of `T`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and is greater than 0; `S` is an input integer; `N` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements; `num` is the next element in the list `N`; `cur` is now equal to `num`; `M[cur]` is 1.**
