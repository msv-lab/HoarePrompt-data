Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the optimal score for the game based on the provided problem description. There are several logical flaws and incorrect assumptions in the code that lead to incorrect results.

Here are some issues with the provided code:
1. The code does not account for the optimal moves by both Alice and Bob. It simply sorts the array and tries to find the MEX based on a flawed logic.
2. It incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be determined by simply checking the counts of each number and their sequence, which does not consider the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.
3. The logic for determining the MEX after the game ends is incorrect. It does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and their strategies to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively.
4. The code does not handle all edge cases, such as when the array contains only one unique number or when all numbers are the same.

To solve this problem correctly, one needs to simulate the game and consider the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here is a brief outline of a correct approach:
1. Count the occurrences of each number in the array.
2. Simulate the game turns, where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.
3. Keep track of the numbers that are added to array `c` and calculate the MEX after all elements are moved from `a` to `c`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        from collections import Counter
        count = Counter(N)
        mex = 0
        while count[mex] > 0:
            mex += 1
        print(mex)

func()
```
This program correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after all elements are moved from `a` to `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. However, this simplified version assumes that the optimal strategy is simply to move elements in a way that the MEX is maximized or minimized based on the count of each number. A more detailed simulation of the game turns would be required for a complete solution.
