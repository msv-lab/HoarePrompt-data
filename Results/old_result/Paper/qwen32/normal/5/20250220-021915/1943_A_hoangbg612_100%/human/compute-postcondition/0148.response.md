Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. `cur` is the last integer in `N` plus 1 if the sum of the counts in `M` is equal to `S`, otherwise `cur` remains the last integer in `N`. `cnt` is a list containing `k` if `M[k]` is equal to 1, otherwise `cnt` is an empty list. `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is the input integer, and `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input.**
