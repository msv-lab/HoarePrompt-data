The code snippet `cur = cnt[1]` assigns the second element of the list `cnt` to the variable `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given that `cnt` is a list of keys from the dictionary `M` where the value is 1, and the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cnt[1]` is the second key in `cnt` that has a count of 1 in `M`.

Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with keys as unique integers from `N` and values as their counts; `cur` is the second element of `cnt`; `cnt` is a list containing all keys from `M` where the value is 1; `T` is decremented by the number of keys in `M`; `S` is the input integer; `N` is the sorted list of integers from the input; the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.**
