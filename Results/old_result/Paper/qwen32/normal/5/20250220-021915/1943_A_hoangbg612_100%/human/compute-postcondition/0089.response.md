The code snippet increments the value of `cur` by 1. The value of `cur` is unknown before the operation, but after the operation, it is increased by 1. The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is still equal to `S` as this operation does not affect the dictionary `M` or its sum.

Output State: **The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`; `cur` is increased by 1.**
