Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by `1`.**
