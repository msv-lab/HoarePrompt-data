The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `M` where the key is the current value of `cur` and the value is `1`. Given that `cur` is `num`, this means that `num` becomes a key in the dictionary `M` with the value `1`.

Since `M` was initially an empty dictionary, after this operation, `M` will contain one key-value pair: `{num: 1}`. The variable `cnt` is a list of keys from `M` where the value is `1`. Since we just added a key with the value `1`, `cnt` will now contain the value `num`.

The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, and `num`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`M` is `{num: 1}`, `cur` is `num`, `cnt` is `[num]`, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer, and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur`.**
