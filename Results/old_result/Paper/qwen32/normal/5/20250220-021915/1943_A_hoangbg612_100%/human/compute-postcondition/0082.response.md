Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cur`.**
