In the given task, the for loop iterates `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. The loop head contains the variable `_` and `T`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `T` times and does not need to be adjusted explicitly since it is automatically managed by the `range` function.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `T`. For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be greater than 0.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0**.
