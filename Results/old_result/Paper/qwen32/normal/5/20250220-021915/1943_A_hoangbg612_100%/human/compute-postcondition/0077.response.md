The code snippet provided is `M[cur] += 1`. This line increments the value at the index `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. 

Given the initial state, the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, and `num` are not directly affected by this line of code. The only variable that changes is the value at the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

Since the exact state of `M` and the value of `cur` are not provided, we can only describe the change to `M[cur]`. 

Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the next element in `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
