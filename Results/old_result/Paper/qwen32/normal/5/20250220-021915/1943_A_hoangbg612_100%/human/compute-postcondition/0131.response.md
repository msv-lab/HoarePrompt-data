Postcondition: **`M` is a dictionary, `cur` is an integer, `cnt` is a list, `T` is decremented by 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer, and `num` is the next element in `N`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `M` includes an additional entry `cur: 1` if `cur` was not already a key in `M`, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the value at key `cur` in `M` is incremented by 1.**
