Postcondition: **`T` is `T-1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, and `num` is compared with `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is a dictionary with the key `num` and value `1`. Otherwise, `cur` remains -1 and `M` is {-1: 1}.**
