The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x1` and `y1`. The values of `i`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged. The condition for `res` is not evaluated or changed in this snippet, so its definition remains as per the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers provided by the input. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y3`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.**
