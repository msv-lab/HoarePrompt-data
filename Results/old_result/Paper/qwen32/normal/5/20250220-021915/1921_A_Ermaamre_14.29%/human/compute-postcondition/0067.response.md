Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four lines of input, with each line containing two integers `x_i, y_i` (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns the side length of each square.**
