The provided code snippet directly assigns the value of `abs(y2 - y1)` to the variable `res`. This means the value of `res` will be the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, regardless of the other conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are updated integers provided by the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `x4` and `y4` are the new integers provided by the input, `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`.**
