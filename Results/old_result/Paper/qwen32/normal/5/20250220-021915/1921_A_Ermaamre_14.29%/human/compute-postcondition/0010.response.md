The code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` and assigns it to the variable `res`. Since `y1` is greater than or equal to `y3`, the absolute difference is simply `y1 - y3`.

Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `x3` are equal, `x2` and `x4` are equal, `y1` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `y2` and `y4` are integers provided by the input, and `y1` is greater than or equal to `y3`; `res` is `y1 - y3`.**
