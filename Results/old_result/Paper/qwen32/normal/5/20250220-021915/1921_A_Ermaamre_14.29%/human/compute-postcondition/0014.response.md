Postcondition: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are integers provided by the input. Additionally, `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`. The current value of `x1` is equal to `x2` and the current value of `x3` is equal to `x4`. The current value of `y1` is less than the current value of `y2`.**
