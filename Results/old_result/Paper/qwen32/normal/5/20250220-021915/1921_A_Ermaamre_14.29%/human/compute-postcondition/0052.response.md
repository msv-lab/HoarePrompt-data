The code snippet updates the values of `x4` and `y4` based on the input provided. The conditions for `res` are not affected by this input as `x4` and `y4` are only being updated, not evaluated against the conditions. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated values of `x4` and `y4`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are updated integers provided by the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `x4` and `y4` are the new integers provided by the input. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y3`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.**
