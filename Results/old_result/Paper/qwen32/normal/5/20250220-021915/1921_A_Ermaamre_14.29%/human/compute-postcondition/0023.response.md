Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, and `y4` are integers provided by the input. Additionally, `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`, and it is not the case that `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`. The current values of the variables satisfy `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`. `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`.**
