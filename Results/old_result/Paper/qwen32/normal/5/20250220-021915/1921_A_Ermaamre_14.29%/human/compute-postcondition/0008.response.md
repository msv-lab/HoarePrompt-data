The code assigns the value of `abs(y3 - y1)` to the variable `res`. Since `y1` is less than `y3`, `abs(y3 - y1)` is simply `y3 - y1`. Therefore, `res` will be the positive difference between `y3` and `y1`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `i`, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, `y4`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `x3` are equal, `x2` and `x4` are equal, `y1` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `y2` and `y4` are integers provided by the input, `y1` is less than `y3`, `res` is `y3 - y1`.**
