Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of four points representing the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For each test case, the program calculates the side length of the square by comparing the x and y coordinates of the points and then computes the area by squaring the side length.

The logic within the function is as follows:
1. It first checks if two pairs of points share the same x-coordinate, which would indicate that these pairs form the vertical sides of the square.
2. If the first condition is met, it calculates the side length by finding the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of the points in the pair with the smaller y-coordinate.
3. If the first condition is not met, it checks if another pair of points shares the same x-coordinate, and if so, it calculates the side length by finding the absolute difference in their y-coordinates.
4. If neither of the first two conditions is met, it checks the last possible pair of points with the same x-coordinate and calculates the side length similarly.
5. Finally, it prints the square of the side length as the area of the square.

The program correctly handles all possible configurations of the points that form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, it should produce the correct area for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
