The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x3` and `y3`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged. The variable `res` is still not defined.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are integers provided by the input, `x3` and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `res` is not defined.**
