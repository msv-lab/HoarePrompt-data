The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we need to focus on these variables. The loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0 because `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

The provided state includes the input `t` and the coordinates of the corners of the square, but these do not affect the loop's execution directly. The loop's execution is solely dependent on the value of `a`.

Given that `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `a` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
