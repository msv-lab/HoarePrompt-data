The provided code snippet updates the values of `x2` and `y2` based on the input. The initial state includes conditions for `res` based on the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4`. However, the code snippet does not affect the conditions for `res` directly. It only updates `x2` and `y2`.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are integers provided by the input, `x2` and `y2` are updated integers provided by the input, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are integers provided by the input. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y3`. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.**
