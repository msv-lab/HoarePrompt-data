Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y3` are integers provided by the input, `x4` and `y4` are integers provided by the input. If `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`. Otherwise, `res` is not defined.**
