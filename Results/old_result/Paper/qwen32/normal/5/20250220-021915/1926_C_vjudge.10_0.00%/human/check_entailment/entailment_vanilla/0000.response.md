Reasoning:  
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description.

1. **Variable Initialization and Scope**: The variable `soma` is initialized outside the loop that handles each test case. This means that the sum from all test cases will accumulate in `soma`, which is not the intended behavior. Each test case should be processed independently, and the result for each should be printed separately.

2. **Loop Range**: The outer loop `for _ in range(N):` runs `N` times, where `N` is the first integer read from the input. This is correct for processing `N` test cases, but the inner loop `for i in range(n):` should iterate from 1 to `n` inclusive, not from 0 to `n-1`. The current loop starts from 0, which will incorrectly add the sum of digits of 0 to the result.

3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1(i)` is called inside the inner loop, where `i` is the current number in the range. However, `func_1` is defined after the main logic, which is not a syntax error in Python but is not the best practice. It's better to define functions before they are used.

4. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `soma` after processing all test cases, but it should print the result for each test case separately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 to n inclusive
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)  # Print the result for each test case
```

Correctness: **False**
