The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1. Since `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is 2**
