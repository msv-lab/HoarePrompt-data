To accurately simulate the execution of the given Python code snippet, we need to understand the behavior of the function `func_1()`. However, since the definition of `func_1()` is not provided, we cannot determine how it affects the variables in the initial state. 

Given that the only variable in the initial state is `t`, which is an input integer greater than 0, and without any information about `func_1()`, we can only conclude that `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0**.
