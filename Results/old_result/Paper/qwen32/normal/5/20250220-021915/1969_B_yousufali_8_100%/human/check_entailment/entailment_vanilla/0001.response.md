Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts. The cost of cyclically shifting a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

### Key Observations

1. **Sorted String**: A binary string is sorted if all 0s are at the beginning and all 1s are at the end.
2. **Cost Calculation**: To sort the string, we need to move all 1s to the right of all 0s. Each time we encounter a '0' after some '1's, we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring that '0' to the front of the '1's. The cost of such a shift depends on the number of '1's encountered so far.

### Algorithm Explanation

The provided program seems to implement the following logic:
- It iterates through each character of the string.
- It keeps a count of the number of '1's encountered so far (`n`).
- Whenever a '0' is encountered after some '1's, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).

### Correctness Verification

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the given examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: `s = "10"`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 1`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `s = "0000"`
   - No '1's, so no cost is added.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `s = "11000"`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 1`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 2`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Output: `9` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: `s = "101011"`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 1`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 2`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 3`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 4`
   - Output: `5` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: `s = "01101001"`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 1`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 2`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 3`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`
   - Encounter '0': `ans += n + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`
   - Encounter '1': `n = 4`
   - Output: `11` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the described logic and passes all the provided test cases.

### Final Answer
