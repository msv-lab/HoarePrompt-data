The code snippet `ans += n + 1` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `n + 1`. The variables `s`, `i`, and `n` are not directly modified by this line of code, but their states are relevant to the context. The value of `ans` will be updated based on the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a binary string with at least one character, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `s[i]` was '1', `n` is incremented by 1; `ans` is increased by `n + 1`.**
