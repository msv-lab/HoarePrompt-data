To determine the output state, we need to consider the function `func_1()` and its impact on the variable `t`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine the exact impact it has on `t`. However, if we assume that `func_1()` does not modify `t` in any way, then the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is 1**.
