The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which is being iterated over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `cnt` to the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `res` is updated based on the value of `cnt` and other variables.
- `t` is decremented by 1.
- `n` is an input integer and remains unchanged.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair and remains unchanged.
- `nums` is a list of integers from the input and remains unchanged.
- `cnt` is the current value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` value and remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be updated to the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. All other variables remain as they are.

State: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers from the input; `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` value.**
