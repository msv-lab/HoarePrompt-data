To determine the output of the `print(res)` statement, we need to break down the initial state and understand the computation involved in the variable `res`.

### Computation Breakdown:

1. **Variable Definitions:**
   - `res` is the cumulative sum of two components:
     - `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt >= 3`
     - `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt >= 2`
   - `total_sum` is defined as the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt`.

2. **Understanding the Components:**
   - `math.comb(cnt, 3)` computes the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items.
   - `math.comb(cnt, 2)` computes the number of ways to choose 2 items from `cnt` items.
   - `total_sum` is computed by summing all elements in `num_of_lens`, excluding the current `cnt`.

### Calculation Steps:
1. **Iterate through each `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:**
   - For each `cnt` that is `>= 3`, add `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to `res`.
   - For each `cnt` that is `>= 2`, compute `total_sum` by excluding the current `cnt` from `num_of_lens` and summing the remaining elements.
   - Add `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to `res`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `num_of_lens` is a list like `[5, 3, 2]` for illustration purposes.

- **For `cnt = 5`:**
  - `math.comb(5, 3) = 10`
  - `total_sum = 3 + 2 = 5`
  - `math.comb(5, 2) * total_sum = 10 * 5 = 50`
  - `res += 10 + 50 = 60`

- **For `cnt = 3`:**
  - `math.comb(3, 3) = 1`
  - `total_sum = 5 + 2 = 7`
  - `math.comb(3, 2) * total_sum = 3 * 7 = 21`
  - `res += 1 + 21 = 82`

- **For `cnt = 2`:**
  - `math.comb(2, 3) = 0` (since 2 is less than 3)
  - `total_sum = 5 + 3 = 8`
  - `math.comb(2, 2) * total_sum = 1 * 8 = 8`
  - `res += 8 = 90`

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the computation steps, `res` will be the cumulative sum of the specified calculations for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens`.

Output: **res (where res is the cumulative sum of math.comb(cnt, 3) for each cnt >= 3 and math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum for each cnt >= 2, with total_sum being the sum of all counts in num_of_lens except the current cnt)**
