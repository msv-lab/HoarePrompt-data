The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair. The state of `cnt` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts because it is assigned values from `num_of_lens.values()` during each iteration.

Given the provided state:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `nums`
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input
- `res` is 0

To ensure the loop executes, `num_of_lens` must be non-empty. Therefore, `nums` must contain at least one integer, which will result in `num_of_lens` having at least one key-value pair.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `res` is 0**
