The only variable in the loop head is `x`, which iterates over the elements of the list `nums`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `x` to the next element in `nums`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer

Let's assume that in the previous iteration, `x` was the `i`-th element of `nums`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be the `(i+1)`-th element of `nums`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer, `x` is the next element in `nums` after the previous `x`**.

To be more specific, if in the previous iteration `x` was `nums[i]`, then in the next iteration `x` will be `nums[i+1]`. However, since we do not have the exact value of `i`, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer, `x` is the next element in `nums`**.
