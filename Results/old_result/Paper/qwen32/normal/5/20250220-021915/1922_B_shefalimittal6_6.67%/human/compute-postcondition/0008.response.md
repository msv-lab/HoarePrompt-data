The given code snippet increments the count of the integer `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. If `x` is not already a key in the dictionary, it is added with a value of 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value incremented by 1
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer
- `x` is the next element in `nums`

After executing the line `num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1`, the value associated with the key `x` in `num_of_lens` will be incremented by 1. If `x` was not previously in the dictionary, it will be added with an initial value of 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of `x` is incremented by 1; `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least one integer; `x` is the next element in `nums`.**
