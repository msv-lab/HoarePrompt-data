The code snippet `n = int(input())` will prompt for an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `n`. The variables `res` and `t` are not affected by this input operation. The value of `t` is described as being one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, which remains unchanged by this code.

Output State: **`res` (unchanged), `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer.**
