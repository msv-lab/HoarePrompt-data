The code calculates `total_sum` by summing up the values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary where the value is not equal to `cnt`. This means that `total_sum` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except those that are equal to `cnt`. The values of `res`, `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, and `nums` remain unchanged by this code snippet. The only new variable introduced is `total_sum`.

Output State: **`res` is the initial value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` was greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged; `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair; `nums` is a list of integers from the input; `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where the value is not equal to `cnt`.**
