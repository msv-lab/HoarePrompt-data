Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must contain at least one integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `nums` and each value is the count of that element in `nums` (and must have at least one key-value pair), `t` remains in its initial state, `n` remains in its initial state, and if `cnt` is an integer with a value of at least 3, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
