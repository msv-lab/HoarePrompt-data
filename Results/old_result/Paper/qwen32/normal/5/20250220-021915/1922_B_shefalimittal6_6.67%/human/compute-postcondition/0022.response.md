The code snippet `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` calculates the number of combinations of `cnt` items taken 3 at a time and adds this value to `res`. Given the initial state, `cnt` is `cnt_next`, which is the next value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least one integer, `cnt` is `cnt_next`, and `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`**.
