The code snippet `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces, and then converts each substring into an integer, resulting in a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `nums`.

The variables `res`, `t`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `num_of_lens` remains an empty dictionary as it is not modified in the given code.

Output State: **`res` (unchanged), `t` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of integers from the input.**
