The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `nums`. 

The initial state specifies that `res` is the cumulative sum of certain combinations based on the counts in `num_of_lens`, `t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, and `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary. 

After executing the code snippet, `nums` is updated with the integer values from the input, but the values of `res`, `t`, `n`, and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers read from the input; `res` is the cumulative sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt >= 3` and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt >= 2` where `total_sum` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt`; `t` is `t-1`; `n` is an input integer; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**
