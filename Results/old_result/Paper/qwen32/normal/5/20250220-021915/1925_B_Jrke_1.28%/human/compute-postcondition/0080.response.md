The code snippet sets `ans` to 1, regardless of its previous value. Other variables (`x`, `n`, `k`, and the number of iterations left) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 1, `x` and `n` are the values obtained from the input, `k` is `x // n`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.**
