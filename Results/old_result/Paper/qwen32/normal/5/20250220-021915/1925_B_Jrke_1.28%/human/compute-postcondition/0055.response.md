Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 1, `n` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the result of `x // n`, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of `[1, i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the maximum of `[1, x // i]`. If `x % i == 0`, `l` is defined as per the condition involving `i` and `k`. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
