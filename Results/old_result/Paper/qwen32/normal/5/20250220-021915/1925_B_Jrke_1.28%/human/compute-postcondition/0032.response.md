Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is `i + 4`. If `x % i == 0`, `l` is a list containing the initial value of `ans`. If `x // i <= k`, `l` also contains `x // i`. If `x % i == 0` and `x // i <= k`, `l` contains the initial value of `ans` and the new value of `i`. Otherwise, `l` contains only the initial value of `ans`.**
