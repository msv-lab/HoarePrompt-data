Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 4 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is `i + 4`. If `x % i == 0`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` constructed based on the conditions provided. Otherwise, there is no change to `l` or `ans`.**
