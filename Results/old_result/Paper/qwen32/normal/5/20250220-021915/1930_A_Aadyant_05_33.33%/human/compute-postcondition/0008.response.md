The code snippet `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace and assigns this list to `list1`. The variables `num`, `out`, `list2`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by this operation.

Output State: **`num` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a list of substrings from `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is the string input provided by the user.**
