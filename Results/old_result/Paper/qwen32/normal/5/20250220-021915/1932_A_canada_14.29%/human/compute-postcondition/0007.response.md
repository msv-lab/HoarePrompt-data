The code snippet provided is `thorn = 0`. This line of code sets the variable `thorn` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `thorn` changes from whatever it was to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0; the current character `i` is '@'**.
