Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s` after the previous `i`. If `i` is equal to '@', `ret` is increased by 1 and `thorn` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to '*', `thorn` is incremented by 1, and if `thorn` was equal to 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` remains unchanged.**
