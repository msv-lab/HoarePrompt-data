Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character. If the current character `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If the current character `i` is not '@', `ret` remains 0. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 2 if it was 2 initially, otherwise `thorn` is set to 1. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains 0.**
