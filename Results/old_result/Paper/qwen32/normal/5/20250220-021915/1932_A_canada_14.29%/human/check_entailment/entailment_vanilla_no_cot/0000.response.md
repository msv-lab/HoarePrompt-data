Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum number of coins that can be collected. The main issue is that it does not properly account for the fact that you can move either one or two cells at a time, and it incorrectly resets the `thorn` counter when encountering an empty cell. Additionally, the program does not use dynamic programming or memoization to keep track of the maximum coins that can be collected up to each cell, which is necessary to solve the problem optimally.

Here is a corrected version of the program using dynamic programming:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[i - 1] == '*':
                dp[i] = -1  # Mark cells with thorns as unreachable
            else:
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1]  # Carry forward the maximum coins from the previous cell
                if i > 1 and dp[i - 2] != -1:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 2])  # Consider the maximum coins from two cells back
                if s[i - 1] == '@':
                    dp[i] += 1  # Add the coin if the current cell has one
        
        # Find the maximum coins collected, avoiding thorn cells
        max_coins = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if dp[i] != -1:
                max_coins = max(max_coins, dp[i])
        
        print(max_coins)

func()
```

This version of the program uses a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of coins that can be collected up to the i-th cell. It correctly handles the constraints of the problem and ensures that thorn cells are not considered in the path.
