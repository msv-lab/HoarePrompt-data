Let's break down the given initial state and understand the variables and their values:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `len` is the input integer, which represents the length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a list of characters from a new input string.
- `ret` is the count of '@' characters in the string `s`.
- `thorn` is a variable that is set to 0 if the loop completes without breaking due to two consecutive '*', otherwise it is set to 1. However, `thorn` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.

The code snippet we are concerned with is:
```python
print(ret)
```

Given that `ret` is the count of '@' characters in the string `s`, the `print(ret)` statement will output the number of '@' characters in the list `s`.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ret`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of '@' characters in the string `s`.

Output: **ret (where ret is the count of '@' characters in the string `s`)**
