Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `thorn` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `thorn` is incremented by 1, and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
