Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and the path is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is guaranteed to be '.'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn == 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; len is an input integer; s is a list of characters from the input string; ret is the total number of '@' characters encountered in s before thorn reaches 2; thorn is either 0, 1, or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is the count of '@' characters in `s`; `thorn` is 0 if the loop ended due to encountering '@' or reaching the end of the list, or 1 if the loop ended due to encountering '*' once and then reaching the end of the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `ret` is the count of '@' characters in the string `s`, and `thorn` is 0 if the loop completes without breaking due to two consecutive '*', otherwise it is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
