The value of `thorn` is set to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character; `thorn` is 0; `i` is the next character in the list `s`.
