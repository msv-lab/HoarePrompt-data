The code snippet resets the variable `ret` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `thorn`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is the input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the new input string; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0 if the loop ended due to encountering '@' or reaching the end of the previous list, or 1 if the loop ended due to encountering '*' once and then reaching the end of the previous list.**
