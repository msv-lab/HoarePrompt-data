The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, or `i`. It only terminates the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement, but since no loop or switch is present in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the program state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1, `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
