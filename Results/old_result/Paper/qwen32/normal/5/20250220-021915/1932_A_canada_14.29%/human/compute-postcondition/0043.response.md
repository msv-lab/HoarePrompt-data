The value of `thorn` is explicitly set to 0 by the code. The other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `ret` is 0; `thorn` is 0.**
