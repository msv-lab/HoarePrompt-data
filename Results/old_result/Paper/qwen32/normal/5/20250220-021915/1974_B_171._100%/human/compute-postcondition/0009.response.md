Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse counterpart in `unique_chars`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is equal to `len_unique`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing, the `char_map` dictionary will have each unique character from `unique_chars` mapped to the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars`. For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`. The variables `encoded` and `unique_chars` remain unchanged, and `len_unique` reflects the number of unique characters. The loop variable `i` will be equal to the length of `unique_chars` after the loop completes all iterations.
