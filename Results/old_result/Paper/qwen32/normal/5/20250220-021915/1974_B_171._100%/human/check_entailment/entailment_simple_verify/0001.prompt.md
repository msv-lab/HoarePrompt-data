You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
Let's break down the given problem and the provided program to see if it correctly performs the decoding process as described.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to decode a string `b` that was encoded using a specific algorithm.
   - The algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` consisting of all distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the mapping process.
   - From the encoded string `b`, we can identify the unique characters and sort them to form `r`.
   - We then create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Using this mapping, we replace each character in `b` with its corresponding original character to get `s`.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading input and parsing it into the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the string `b` itself.
   - The function `func_1` is called to decode the string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the unique characters of `b` are extracted and sorted to form `r`.
   - A dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - The encoded string `b` is then decoded by replacing each character using the `char_map`.
   - The decoded string is returned and printed for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the unique characters and sorts them.
   - It accurately creates the symmetric mapping for decoding.
   - The decoding process is correctly implemented by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding original character using the `char_map`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. It handles multiple test cases and processes each encoded string `b` to produce the correct original string `s`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
