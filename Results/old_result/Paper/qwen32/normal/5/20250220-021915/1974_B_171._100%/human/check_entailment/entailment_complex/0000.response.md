Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to decode the encoded string back to its original form. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Unique Character Extraction and Mapping**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each encoded string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`, it first extracts all unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically, storing them in `unique_chars`.
   - A dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - Using the `char_map`, the program constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding mapped character from `char_map`.
   - The decoded string is then returned.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly identifies unique characters and creates a mapping that reflects the encoding process.
   - It accurately applies this mapping to decode the string `b` back to its original form `s`.
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently without exceeding the input constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
