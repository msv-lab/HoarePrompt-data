The code snippet assigns a new key-value pair to the `char_map` dictionary. The key is `unique_chars[i]`, and the value is `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`. This means that for each character at index `i` in the `unique_chars` list, the character at the mirrored index from the end of the list is mapped to it. 

Since `char_map` was initially empty, it now contains this new mapping. The other variables (`encoded`, `unique_chars`, `len_unique`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0.**
