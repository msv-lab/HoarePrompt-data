Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

In this output state, `encoded` and `unique_chars` retain their initial values, and a new variable `char_map` has been introduced as an empty dictionary.
