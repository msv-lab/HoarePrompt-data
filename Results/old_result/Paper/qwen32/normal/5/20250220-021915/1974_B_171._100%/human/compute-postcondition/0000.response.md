Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded`.**

This means that `unique_chars` now contains all the distinct lowercase Latin letters that appear in any of the strings within the `encoded` list, and these characters are sorted in ascending order. The state of `encoded` remains unchanged.
