### Reasoning:

The original assessment suggests that the provided program is incorrect due to misinterpretation of the symmetric mapping required for decoding. However, upon reviewing the annotated code and the logic implemented in `func_1`, it appears that the original program is actually correct.

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Constructing `unique_chars`:**
   ```python
   unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
   ```
   This line correctly creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.

2. **Creating `char_map`:**
   ```python
   char_map = {}
   len_unique = len(unique_chars)
   for i in range(len_unique):
       char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
   ```
   This loop maps each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric counterpart. For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`, the `char_map` will be `{'a': 'd', 'b': 'c', 'c': 'b', 'd': 'a'}`.

3. **Decoding the string:**
   ```python
   decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
   ```
   This line uses the `char_map` to decode each character in the encoded string `b` by replacing it with its mapped counterpart.

The original assessment's concern seems to be that the program is using the wrong mapping direction. However, the program is indeed reversing the encoding process correctly. When encoding, each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`. Therefore, to decode, each character in `b` should be replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r` as well, which is exactly what the program does.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect because the provided program correctly reverses the encoding process using the symmetric mapping as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
