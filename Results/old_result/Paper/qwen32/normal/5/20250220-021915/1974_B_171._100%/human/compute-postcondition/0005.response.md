The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len_unique`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `len_unique`. If `i` is less than `len_unique`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index, and `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `len_unique` remains the same.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `k < len_unique`). For the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we do not have the exact value of `k`, we can generalize it to say that `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To make it more precise, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `k`, we can generalize:

State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more specific and accurate:

State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since `i` was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration:

State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`**.
