### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Encoding Process**:
   - Given a string `s`, create a new string `r` that consists of all distinct characters of `s` sorted in alphabetical order.
   - Replace each character in `s` by its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character of `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on).

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - Given an encoded string `b`, the task is to reverse the encoding process to find the original string `s`.

#### Provided Solution Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the string `b` itself.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters Extraction**: It first extracts unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - **Decoding**: It then constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

3. **Output**:
   - The decoded string `s` is printed for each test case.

#### Verification:
- The solution correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them to form `r`.
- It correctly maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.
- It correctly constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value.

The program's logic aligns perfectly with the problem's decoding requirement. Given the input-output example pairs, the program produces the correct output, which further confirms its correctness.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` to retrieve the original string `s`.

**Correctness: True**
