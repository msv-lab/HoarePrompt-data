The given code snippet updates the `char_map` dictionary by mapping `unique_chars[i]` to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`. This operation essentially reverses the mapping for the character at index `i` in `unique_chars`.

Given the initial state:
- `encoded` is a list of strings with specified constraints.
- `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded`.
- `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to another character in `unique_chars` based on the formula `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.
- `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The code snippet does not affect `encoded`, `unique_chars`, `len_unique`, or the overall structure of `char_map` except for the specific mapping of `unique_chars[i]`.

After the execution of the code snippet:
- The mapping of `unique_chars[i]` in `char_map` is updated to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`encoded` is a list of strings, where each string b consists of lowercase Latin letters and the length of each string b is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The total length of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters present in all strings in `encoded` and must have at least 1 character; `char_map` is a dictionary with `unique_chars[i]` mapped to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`; `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars` and must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**
