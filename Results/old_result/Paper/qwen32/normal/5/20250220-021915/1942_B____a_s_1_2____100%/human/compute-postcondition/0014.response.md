The code snippet updates the value of `mex` by taking the minimum of its current value and the value of `p[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `p[i]` is `p[0]`, which is `mex - a[0]`. Therefore, `mex` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `mex - a[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list where `p[0]` is now `mex - a[0]` and `p[i]` for `i > 0` remains unchanged, `mex` is the minimum of the previous `mex` and `mex - a[0]`, `i` is 0.**
