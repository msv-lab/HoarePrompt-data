The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a common placeholder for a loop variable that is not used inside the loop). The loop will execute `t` times, and the loop variable `_` will simply iterate from 0 to `t-1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the loop variable `_` for the next iteration. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, `mex`), we just need to increment `_` by 1.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where `p[i] = n - a[i]` for each `i`, and `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`.

Since `_` is the loop variable and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration, if `_` was `i` in the previous iteration, it will be `i+1` in the next iteration. However, we do not have the exact value of `_` from the previous iteration, but we know it must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where `p[i] = n - a[i]` for each `i`, and `mex` is the minimum value in the list `p`. The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1.**
