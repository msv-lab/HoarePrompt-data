The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the list `p` at index `i` by calculating `mex - a[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `p[1]` is updated. The values of `mex` and `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) are used in this calculation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list where the 0-th element is `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]` and the 1-st element is `mex - a[1]`, and all other elements are -1; `mex` is `min(n, n - a[0]) - a[0]`; `i` is 1**.
