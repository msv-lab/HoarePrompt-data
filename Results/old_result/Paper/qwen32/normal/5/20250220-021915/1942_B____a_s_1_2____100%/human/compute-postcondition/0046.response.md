The code snippet updates the value of `mex` by taking the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Given the initial state, `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the value of `p[i]` where `i` is `n - 3`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]` and all other elements are `-1`, `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, `i` is `n - 3`.**
