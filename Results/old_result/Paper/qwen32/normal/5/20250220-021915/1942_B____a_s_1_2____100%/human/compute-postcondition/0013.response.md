The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` modifies the value of `p[i]` based on the current values of `mex` and `a[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `mex` remain unchanged, but `p[i]` is updated. Since `i` is 0, `p[0]` is specifically updated to `mex - a[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list where `p[0]` is now `mex - a[0]` and `p[i]` for `i > 0` remains unchanged, `mex` is the minimum of the previous `mex` and `p[0]`, `i` is 0.**
