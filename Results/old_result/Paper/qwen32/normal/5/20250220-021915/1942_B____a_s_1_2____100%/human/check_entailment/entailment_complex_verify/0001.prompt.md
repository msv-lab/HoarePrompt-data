You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times. For each execution, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -n <= a_i <= n. The list `p` is computed such that `p[i] = mex - a[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` to `0`, where `mex` starts at `n` and is updated to be the minimum value in `p` after each assignment. After all `t` iterations, the final output consists of `t` lines, each line representing the list `p` computed for the corresponding input values of `n` and `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes and outputs a list `p` of `n` integers based on the input list `a`. The list `p` is constructed such that for each element `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is initially `n` and is updated to the minimum value in `p` after each assignment. The function outputs `t` lines, each representing the list `p` for the corresponding input values of `n` and `a`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given code to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Understanding:
- We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each element `a_i` in the given array `a`, the following condition holds: `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- `MEX` of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code attempts to construct the permutation `p` by iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `p` is initialized as an array of `-1` of length `n`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`. This is a reasonable starting point because `mex` should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the constructed part of `p`.

2. **Iterating Backwards**:
   - The loop iterates from `i = n-1` to `i = 0`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.

### Correctness Verification:
- The key idea here is to ensure that `mex` correctly represents the smallest non-negative integer not in the constructed part of `p` at each step.
- By iterating backwards, the code ensures that when calculating `p[i]`, `mex` is already the smallest non-negative integer not in `p[i+1]` to `p[n-1]`.
- The update of `mex` ensures that it remains valid for the next iteration.

### Verification with Examples:
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:

1. **First Example**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` which matches the expected output.

2. **Second Example**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
     - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` which matches the expected output.

3. **Third Example**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `p = [2, 0, 1]`
   - Calculation:
     - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
     - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
     - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
   - Output: `p = [2, 0, 1]` which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for the given array `a` based on the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
