### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to construct a permutation `p` based on the given array `a`, where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. To construct `p` from `a`, the solution provided iterates backwards from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. The key steps are:

1. Initialize `mex` to `n`, which is the length of the permutation `p`.
2. For each element in `a` from the last to the first, compute `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
3. Update `mex` to be the minimum value between the current `mex` and the newly computed `p[i]`.

The logic behind this approach is that, by iterating backwards, we can ensure that the `mex` value used for each `p[i]` is the smallest possible value that hasn't yet been used in the permutation `p` up to that point. This is because `mex` is updated to be the minimum value in `p` after each assignment, ensuring that the next `p[i]` will use the smallest possible `mex` value.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It processes each test case independently and constructs the permutation `p` as described. Given that the problem guarantees at least one valid permutation exists for the input, the program should correctly output a valid permutation for each test case.
