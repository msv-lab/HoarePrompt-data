The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be set to a value greater than `0` but less than or equal to `n - 1`. Since the loop is decrementing `i`, the next value of `i` should be the value it had before the last iteration, which is `1`.

Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we set `i` to `1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list where `p[i]` is `n - a[i]`, `mex` is the minimum of `n` and `p[i]`, `i` is 1**
