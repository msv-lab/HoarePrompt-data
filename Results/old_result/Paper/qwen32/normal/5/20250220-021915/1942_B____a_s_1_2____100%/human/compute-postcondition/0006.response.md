The loop in the given code is defined as:

```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop iterates over the variable `i` starting from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). The only variables in the loop head that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the range must include at least one value. This means that `n` must be greater than 0 because if `n` is 0, the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` would be `range(-1, -1, -1)`, which is empty.

Given the state before the loop starts, the variable `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, and `mex` is `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, `mex`) do not affect the execution of the loop directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `mex` is `n`**
