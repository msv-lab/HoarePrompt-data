The code initializes a list `p` with `-1` repeated `n` times. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `p` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times.**
