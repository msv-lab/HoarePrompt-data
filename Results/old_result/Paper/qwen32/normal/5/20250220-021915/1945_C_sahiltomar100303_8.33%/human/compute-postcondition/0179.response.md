Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the new user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `left` is 0 or not equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is either `n` or the position where the loop conditions are no longer satisfied, `i` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 5 and `trightZero` is 2, `trightOne` is 0. If `s[i]` is '1', then `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 2, and `trightOne` is either 2 or 3`.**

The value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
