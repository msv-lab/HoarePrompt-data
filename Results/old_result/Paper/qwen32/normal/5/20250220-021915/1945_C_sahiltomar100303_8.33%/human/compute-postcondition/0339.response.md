Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is -1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0', otherwise `left` is 0. `leftZero` is -3 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `leftZero` is -2. `rightZero` is 3 if `s[left - 1]` is '0', otherwise `rightZero` is 2. `rightOne` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0'.**

In simpler terms, the value of `left` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged unless `s[left - 1]` was '0' or not '0', which affects `left` and `rightOne` as specified.
