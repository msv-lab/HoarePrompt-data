Postcondition: **`n` is 2, `left` is either 0 or not 0, `leftZero` is -1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightZero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' otherwise 0, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[0]` is '1' otherwise unchanged, `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 1, `trightZero` is 0 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 0, `tleftOne` is 1 if `s[1]` is '1' otherwise 0, `trightOne` is 0 if `s[1]` is '0' otherwise 0. If `left` is 0 and `right` is not equal to 2, then `right` remains not equal to 2. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to 2, then `rightOne` is less than 2. If `left` is not 0 and `right` is 2, then `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (n + 1) // 2 if it meets the condition. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than (n + 1) // 2. If `left` is not 0 and `right` is not 2, then the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between (n + 1) // 2 and `right`.**
