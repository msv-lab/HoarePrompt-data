Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 2 if `s[left - 2]` is '0', otherwise it is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` minus 1 if `s[left - 2]` is not '0', otherwise it is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 2, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 2 if `s[left - 2]` is '0', otherwise it is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` plus 1, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s`, `left` is `n // 2 - 1`, and `leftMove` is 0**.

In simple terms: The value of `rightZero` and `trightZero` have been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
