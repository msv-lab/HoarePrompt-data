The code snippet increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. The initial value of `trightZero` is 2, so after the increment, `trightZero` becomes 3.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 3 if `s[i]` was initially '0', `trightZero` is 3, `rightOne` is 1 if `s[i]` was initially '1', `trightOne` is 1, `i` is `mid + 1`.**
