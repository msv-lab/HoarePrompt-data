The value of `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `rightZero` depends on the character at index 0 of `s`. If the character at index 0 of `s` is '0', `rightZero` is initially 1; otherwise, it is 0. After the increment, if the character at index 0 of `s` is '0', `rightZero` becomes 2; otherwise, it becomes 1. The values of other variables (`n`, `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 1, If the character at index 0 of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is -2 and `rightZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftZero` is -1 and `rightZero` is 1.**
