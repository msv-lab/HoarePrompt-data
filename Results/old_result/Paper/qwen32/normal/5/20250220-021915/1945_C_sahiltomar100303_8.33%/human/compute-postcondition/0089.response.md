Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2` + 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2` - 1, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s` after adjustments, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's in the second half of `s` after adjustments, `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is `mid`. If `s[right]` is '0', `trightZero` is one less than its previous value. If `s[right]` is '1', `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**
