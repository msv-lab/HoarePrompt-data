Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the new user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `left` is 0 or not equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is either `n` or the position where the loop conditions are no longer satisfied, `i` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's in the first `mid` characters of `s`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 6 if the if condition is true, otherwise `rightZero` is 4. If `s[i]` is '0', then `trightZero` is 3 if the if condition is true, otherwise `trightZero` is 2. If `s[i]` is '0', then `trightOne` is 0 if the if condition is true, otherwise `trightOne` is 2. If `s[i]` is '1', then `rightZero` is 2, `rightOne` is 2, and `trightOne` is either 2 or 3 if the if condition is true, otherwise `rightOne` is 4 and `trightOne` is either 3 or 4.**
