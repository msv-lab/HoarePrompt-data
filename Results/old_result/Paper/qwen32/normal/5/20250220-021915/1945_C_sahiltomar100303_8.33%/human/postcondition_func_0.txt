The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing only '0's and '1's. It determines and prints the optimal position to divide the houses such that the number of '0's (residents wanting to live on the left) and '1's (residents wanting to live on the right) are balanced on either side of the division point.
