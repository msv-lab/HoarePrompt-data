The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` typically represents the number of test cases in a problem where multiple scenarios need to be processed. The initial state describes `n` (the number of houses) and `a` (a string of 0s and 1s indicating the residents' preferences), but these are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is an integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses; `a` is a string of length n consisting only of 0s and 1s.**
