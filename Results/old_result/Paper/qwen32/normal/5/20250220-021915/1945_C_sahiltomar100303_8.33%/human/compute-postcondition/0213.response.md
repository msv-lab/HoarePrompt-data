Postcondition: **`t` remains `t - 1`; `n` remains the user's input; `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s; `s` remains the user's input string; `mid` remains `n // 2`; `left` remains `0`; `leftMove` remains `0`; `right` is now `mid`; `i` remains `n`; `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` remain the counts of '0's and '1's in the first `mid` characters of `s` such that `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2`; `trightZero` and `trightOne` remain the counts of '0's and '1's in the last `n - mid` characters of `s` such that `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`; `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s` such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` when `left` is 0; `s[right]` is '0'**
