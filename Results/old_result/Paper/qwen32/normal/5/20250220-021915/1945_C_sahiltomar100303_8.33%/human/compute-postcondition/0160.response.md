Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the new user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is 0 or not equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `right` is either `n` or the position where the loop conditions are no longer satisfied, `i` is 2, `leftZero` is 2, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 1 or 3, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 2, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1 or 2, `trightOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `leftOne` was initially 1 or 2, it becomes 2 or 3 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
