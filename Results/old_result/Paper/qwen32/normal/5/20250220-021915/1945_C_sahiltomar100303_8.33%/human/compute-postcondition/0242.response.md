Postcondition: **`t` remains `t - 1`; `n` remains the user's input; `a` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s; `s` remains the user's input string; `mid` remains `n // 2`; `left` is 0; `leftMove` remains 0; `right` is equal to `n`, satisfying the conditions `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right) // 2`; `i` remains `n`; `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are adjusted such that `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `tleftOne >= (right + 1) // 2 - tleftZero`; `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted such that `trightOne < (n + 1) // 2` (negation of the if condition); `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain adjusted based on the characters encountered in the string `s` such that `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` when `left` is 0. The condition `left == 0` is true, and `right` is equal to `n`.**
