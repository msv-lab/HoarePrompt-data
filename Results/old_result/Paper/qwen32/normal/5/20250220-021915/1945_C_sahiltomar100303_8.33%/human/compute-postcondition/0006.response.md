The code snippet provided initializes a variable `rightZero` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `mid`, and `leftZero` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0.**
