Output State: **`n` is 2, `left` is 1, If the character at index 0 of `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is -2 and `rightZero` is 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` is -1 and `rightOne` is 0**

Natural Language: The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1. If the character at index 0 of `s` is '0', `leftZero` was initially -1 and is now -2. Otherwise, `leftZero` was initially 0 and is now -1. The values of `n`, `left`, and `rightZero` or `rightOne` remain unchanged.
