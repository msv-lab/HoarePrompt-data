Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of 0s and 1s, `s` is the user's input, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `rightOne` is 1, `tleftZero` is the total number of '0's in the first half of `s`, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is the total number of '1's in the first half of `s`, `trightOne` is 0, and `s[i]` is '1'**

Explanation: The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
