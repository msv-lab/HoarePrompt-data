To determine what will be printed by the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the list `nums`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n` and `k` are integers provided as input, but their specific values are not given in the precondition.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), but its exact value is not provided.
- `nums` is a list of integers explicitly defined as follows:
  \[
  [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 8388608, k - 4194304, k + 1, 2k - 4194303]
  \]
- `idx` is set to 22, but it is not used in the `print(*nums)` statement.

### Analysis:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print all the elements in the `nums` list separated by spaces. Since the list `nums` is explicitly defined, we can list all its elements directly.

### Elements of `nums`:
1. The first 23 elements are powers of 2, starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{22}\).
2. The 24th element is \(k - 4194304\).
3. The 25th element is \(k + 1\).
4. The 26th element is \(2k - 4194303\).

### Final Output:
The output will be the list of integers separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 8388608 k - 4194304 k + 1 2k - 4194303**
