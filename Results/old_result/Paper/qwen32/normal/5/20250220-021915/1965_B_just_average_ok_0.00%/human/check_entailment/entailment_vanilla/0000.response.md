Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there exists a subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `v`.

### Code Analysis

The provided code attempts to construct such a sequence. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initialization**: The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Powers of 2**: It generates a list `nums` containing the first 24 powers of 2 (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`). These powers of 2 are chosen because they can form any sum from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\) through their combinations.

3. **Adjusting for `k`**: The code then finds the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. It removes this power of 2 from the list and adds three new numbers:
   - `k - nums[idx]`: This number ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any combination of the remaining numbers.
   - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed.
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed.

### Verification

Let's verify if the constructed sequence meets the problem requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
   - The number `nums[idx]` (the highest power of 2 ≤ `k`) is removed from the list.
   - The number `k - nums[idx]` is added. This means that `k` cannot be formed by the remaining numbers because `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 ≤ `k` and `k - nums[idx]` is added instead.

2. **Subsequences Sum to All `v ≠ k`**:
   - The numbers `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensure that sums greater than `k` can be formed.
   - The remaining powers of 2 can form any sum from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\) except `k`.

### Conclusion

The provided code constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence while all other sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer

Reasoning: The program constructs a sequence that ensures no subsequence sums to `k` while all other sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed. The approach uses powers of 2 and carefully adjusts the sequence to meet the problem requirements.
Correctness: **True**
