### Reasoning:

The given problem requires constructing a sequence of non-negative integers such that no subsequence sums to `k`, but every other integer from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as the sum of some subsequence.

The provided Python program constructs such a sequence by initially creating a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\). It then identifies the highest power of 2 that is less than `k` and adjusts the sequence to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`. Specifically, it removes the power of 2 that is closest to and less than `k` and replaces it with values that prevent the formation of `k` while still allowing the formation of all other sums up to `n`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. **For each test case**:
   - It reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2.
   - It finds the highest power of 2 that is less than `k` and removes it from the list.
   - It adds three new values to the list:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This value ensures that the sum of this value and the removed power of 2 does not equal `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This value ensures that sums greater than `k` can still be formed.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This value further ensures that sums greater than `k` can be formed and that `k` cannot be formed by adding any combination of these values.
3. **Output**: The program outputs the length of the modified list and the list itself.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **No subsequence sums to `k`**: By carefully choosing the new values and removing the power of 2 closest to `k`, the program ensures that no subsequence of the final list sums to `k`.
- **All sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed**: The initial list of powers of 2 allows the formation of all sums up to \(2^{24} - 1\), which is far greater than any possible `n` (up to \(10^6\)). The adjustments made to the list do not prevent the formation of all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

The provided execution summary confirms the program's behavior, and the logic aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly constructs the required sequence for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
