To determine the output of the `print(len(nums))` statement, let's break down the given information:

1. `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, but their specific values are not relevant to the calculation of `len(nums)`.
2. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), but it is also not relevant to the calculation of `len(nums)`.
3. `nums` is a list defined as: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k + 1, 2k + 2]\).
4. `idx` is set to 26, but it is not used in the `print(len(nums))` statement, so it is irrelevant.

Now, let's count the number of elements in the list `nums`:

- The first 24 elements are explicitly listed as powers of 2: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
- The 25th element is \(k + 1\).
- The 26th element is \(2k + 2\).

Thus, the list `nums` contains a total of 26 elements.

Therefore, the `print(len(nums))` statement will output the length of the list `nums`, which is 26.

Output: **26**
