To determine the output, we need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`n` and `k`**:
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input.

2. **`t`**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - The value of `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this task.

3. **`nums`**:
   - `nums` is constructed as a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{25}\).
   - The value \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from the list, where `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\).

4. **`idx`**:
   - `idx` is determined by the condition \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\).
   - We need to find the smallest integer `idx` such that this condition holds.

### Construction of `nums`

- The list `nums` initially contains the values: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
- We need to remove the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from this list, where `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\).

### Determining `idx`

- `idx` is the smallest integer such that \(k < 2^{\text{idx}}\).
- This means we need to find the smallest power of 2 that is greater than `k`.

### Example Calculation

Let's assume `k` is a specific value to illustrate the process. Suppose `k = 10`.

- \(2^0 = 1\) (not greater than 10)
- \(2^1 = 2\) (not greater than 10)
- \(2^2 = 4\) (not greater than 10)
- \(2^3 = 8\) (not greater than 10)
- \(2^4 = 16\) (greater than 10)

So, `idx = 4`, and \(2^4 = 16\) is removed from the list.

### Final List `nums`

- The list `nums` will be: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).

### Length of `nums`

- The length of the list `nums` after removing one element is \(24\).

### General Case

Regardless of the specific value of `k`, the list `nums` will always contain 25 elements initially and will have one element removed, resulting in a final length of 24.

### Output

Thus, the output of the `print(len(nums))` statement will be:

Output: **24**
