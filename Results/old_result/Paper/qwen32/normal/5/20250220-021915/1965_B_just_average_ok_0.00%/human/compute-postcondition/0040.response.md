To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the loop condition `k >= 1 << idx`. The loop will execute if the condition is true.

Given:
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `nums` is a predefined list of powers of 2.
- `idx` is 0.

The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`. Since `idx` is 0, the condition simplifies to `k >= 1 << 0`, which is `k >= 1`.

For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `idx` is already 0 and does not need to be changed, we only need to ensure that `k` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is at least 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` must be at least 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `nums` is \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 0**
