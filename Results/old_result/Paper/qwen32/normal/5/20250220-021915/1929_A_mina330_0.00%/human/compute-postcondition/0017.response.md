The code sorts the list `a`. The values of `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, `kq`, and `i` are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`ntest` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `ntest` ≤ 500, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1] + ... + a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2)] - a[len(a) // 2 - 1]`, `i` is `len(a) // 2`**.
