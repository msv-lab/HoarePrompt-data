### Reasoning:

To determine the maximum beauty of the array, we need to maximize the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n. This can be achieved by arranging the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The approach in the given program is as follows:
1. Sort the array `a`.
2. Calculate the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

However, the logic in the program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The correct approach should be to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The optimal arrangement is to place the smallest and largest elements next to each other, followed by the second smallest and second largest, and so on.

The correct approach would be:
1. Sort the array `a`.
2. Calculate the sum of differences between the (i+1)-th largest element and the i-th smallest element for all i from 0 to n-2.

Let's consider the first test case:
- Input: `3, 2 1 3`
- Sorted array: `1, 2, 3`
- Maximum beauty: `(3 - 1) + (2 - 2) = 2`

The program provided calculates:
- `kq = (3 - 1) = 2` (only considers the difference between the largest and smallest elements)

This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible differences between consecutive elements in the optimal arrangement.

### Correctness: **False**
