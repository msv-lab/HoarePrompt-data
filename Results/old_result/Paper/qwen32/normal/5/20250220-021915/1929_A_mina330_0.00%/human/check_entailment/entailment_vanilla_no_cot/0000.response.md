Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array. The current logic attempts to sum the differences between the largest and smallest elements in a pairwise manner, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty as defined by the problem statement.

To maximize the beauty, which is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. The maximum beauty is achieved when the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, which happens in a sorted array.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()  # Sort the array in ascending order
        kq = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            kq += a[i] - a[i - 1]
        print(kq)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the array is sorted, and the beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This approach ensures that the beauty is maximized.
