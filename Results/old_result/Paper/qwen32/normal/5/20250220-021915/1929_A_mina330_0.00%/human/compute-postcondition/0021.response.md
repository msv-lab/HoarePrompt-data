The only variables in the loop head are `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 1.

State: **`ntest` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `ntest` ≤ 500, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`, `i` is 1**
