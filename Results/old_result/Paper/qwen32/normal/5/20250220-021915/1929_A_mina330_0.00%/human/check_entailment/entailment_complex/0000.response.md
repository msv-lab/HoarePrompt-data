### Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array optimally. The provided program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

This approach is incorrect for maximizing the beauty. The goal is to maximize the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \). To achieve this, the largest elements should be placed after the smallest elements in the array. The optimal way to do this is to place the smallest element first, the largest element second, the second smallest third, the second largest fourth, and so on. This way, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

The provided program, however, does not follow this optimal strategy. Instead, it pairs the largest element with the smallest, the second largest with the second smallest, and so on, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences.
