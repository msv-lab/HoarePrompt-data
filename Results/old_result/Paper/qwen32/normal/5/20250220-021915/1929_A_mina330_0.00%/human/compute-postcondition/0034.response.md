The only variables in the loop head are `i`, which is the loop variable, and the range parameters `0`, `len(a) // 2`, and `1`. Since the loop iterates with `i` starting at `0` and incrementing by `1` until it reaches `len(a) // 2`, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
- The loop increments `i` by `1` in each iteration.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(a) // 2`.

The other variables (`ntest`, `itest`, `n`, `a`, `kq`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`ntest` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `ntest` ≤ 500, `itest` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements, `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, `i` is `len(a) // 2`**
