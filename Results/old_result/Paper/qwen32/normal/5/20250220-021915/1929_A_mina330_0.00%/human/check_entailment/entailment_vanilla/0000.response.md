Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The beauty of the array is calculated as:

\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by arranging the elements in such a way that the largest elements alternate with the smallest elements.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the beauty, we can sort the array and then pair the largest elements with the smallest elements in an alternating manner. For example, if the sorted array is \([a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]\), we can rearrange it as \([a_1, a_n, a_2, a_{n-1}, ...]\).

The maximum beauty can be calculated by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on, up to the middle of the array. This is a correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

Here's the breakdown of the code:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the elements of the array.
3. Sort the array.
4. Calculate the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest, and so on.
5. Print the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the approach to maximize the beauty of the array. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
