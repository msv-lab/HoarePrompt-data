To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables change over each iteration.

The initial state is given as:
- `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `inf` is 200001
- `values` is a list of 200001 integers where `values[i]` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` for `1 ≤ i ≤ 200000`
- `i` is 200001
- `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of 200000

The loop runs `t` times, and in each iteration:
- It reads an integer `value` from the input.
- It prints `values[value]`.

After all `t` iterations, the state of the loop variables and the other variables will be:
- `t` will remain the same as it was initially because it is used to control the loop and is not modified within the loop.
- `value` will hold the last input integer read in the last iteration.
- The list `values` will remain unchanged as it is precomputed and not modified within the loop.
- The variables `inf`, `i`, and `sum_value_digits` will remain unchanged as they are not used or modified within the loop.

Thus, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `value` is the last input integer read; `values`, `inf`, `i`, and `sum_value_digits` remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, the number of iterations `t` and the precomputed list `values` stay the same, while `value` will hold the last integer that was read from the input.
