The code snippet `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments the variable `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. Given that `x` is `'1'`, `int(x)` will be `1`. Therefore, `sum_value_digits` will be incremented by `1`.

Initial values:
- `sum_value_digits` is `int('1') + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.

After the execution:
- `sum_value_digits` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is 3; `x` is `'1'`**
