The code initializes a list called `values` with 200001 elements, all set to 0. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.**
