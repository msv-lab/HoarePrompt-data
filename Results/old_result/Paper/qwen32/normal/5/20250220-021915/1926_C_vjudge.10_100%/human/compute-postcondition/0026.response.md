The given code snippet is `sum_value_digits += int(x)`. This means that the value of `x` (which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but presumably comes from some input or context not provided here) will be converted to an integer and added to `sum_value_digits`.

Since `sum_value_digits` is initially 0, after this operation, `sum_value_digits` will be equal to `int(x)`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `inf`, `values`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is `int(x)`**.
