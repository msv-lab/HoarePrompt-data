The code snippet provided is `sum_value_digits += int(x)`. Given the initial state, the value of `x` is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that `x` is a string representation of an integer since it is being converted to an integer using `int(x)`.

The variable `sum_value_digits` is being updated by adding the integer value of `x` to it. Therefore, the new value of `sum_value_digits` will be its previous value plus the integer value of `x`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `inf`, `values`, `i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros; `i` is 2; `sum_value_digits` is `sum_value_digits` + `int(x)`**.
