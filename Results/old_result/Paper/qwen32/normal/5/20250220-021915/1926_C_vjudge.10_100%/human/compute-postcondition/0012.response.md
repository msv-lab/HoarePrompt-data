The code snippet updates the `values` list at index `i` by adding the `sum_value_digits` to the value at index `i - 1`. Given that `i` is initialized as `n + 1`, the value at `values[n + 1]` is updated to be the sum of the value at `values[n]` and `sum_value_digits`.

Since `values` is initially a list of 200001 zeros, `values[n]` is 0. Therefore, `values[n + 1]` becomes `sum_value_digits`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `inf`, `sum_value_digits`, and the rest of the `values` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is `n + 1`; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.**
