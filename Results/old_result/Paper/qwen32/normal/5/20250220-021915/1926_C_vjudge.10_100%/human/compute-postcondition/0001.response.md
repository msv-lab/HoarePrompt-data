The code snippet provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables `n` and `inf` are mentioned in the initial state but not yet assigned values in the given code snippet. Since only `t` is assigned a value in the provided code, we will update its state accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001.**
