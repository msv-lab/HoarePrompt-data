### Reasoning:
The given Python program (which is actually a Python function `func_1` with a main function call `func_1()` at the beginning) is designed to solve the problem by precomputing the cumulative sum of the digits of integers from 1 to a maximum value (`inf` set to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\)). This precomputation is done in an array `values`, where `values[i]` represents the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an array `values` of size `inf` with all elements set to 0. This array will store cumulative sums of the digits.
2. **Precomputation**:
   - It iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `inf - 1`.
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`).
   - It updates `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[i-1]` (the cumulative sum up to `i-1`) and `sum_value_digits` (the sum of digits of `i`).
3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**: The program correctly computes the required sum of digits for each test case by leveraging precomputation. The logic of summing the digits of each number and storing cumulative sums is accurate.
- **Efficiency**: The precomputation step is efficient given the constraints (`n` up to \(2 \times 10^5\)), as it only runs once before processing any test cases. The complexity of this step is \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the maximum value of `n` (i.e., \(2 \times 10^5\)). Each test case is then processed in \(O(1)\) time by simply accessing the precomputed result.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) and the largest possible input (`n = 2 \times 10^5`) correctly, as verified by the provided example outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
