The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `inf`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `inf`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `inf`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 10, and `inf` is 200001. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 11.

There are no other variables in the loop head that need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4); `n` is a single integer for each of the next `t` lines (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5); `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros except `values[n + 1]` which is 0 and `values[10]` is `sum_value_digits`; `i` is 11; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `n + 2` plus 2.**
