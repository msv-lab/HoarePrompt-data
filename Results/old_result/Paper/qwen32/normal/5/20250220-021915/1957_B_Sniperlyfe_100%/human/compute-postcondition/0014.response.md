The value of `k` is decremented by `nums[i]`. Given that `nums[i]` is defined as `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, the value of `k` will be reduced by whatever `nums[i]` evaluates to. The values of `t`, `n`, and the condition for `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n > 1\), `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, `k` is `k - nums[i]`**.
