Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element is calculated as \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\). The subsequent elements are the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k` until `k` is reduced to 0, and the remaining elements in the list are filled with 0.**
