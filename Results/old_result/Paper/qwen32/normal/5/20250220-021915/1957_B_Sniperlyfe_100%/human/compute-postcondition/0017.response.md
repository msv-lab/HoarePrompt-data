The code snippet `nums[0] += k` modifies the first element of the list `nums` by adding the value of `k` to it. Given the initial state, `nums[0]` is initially set to \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\). After executing the code, the new value of `nums[0]` will be \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\).

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and the subsequent elements of `nums`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is 0 if it was exhausted during the loop, otherwise it is the remaining value, and `nums` is a list where the first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\) and the subsequent elements are filled with the values `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` is 0, and the rest are 0.**
