You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is 0 if it was exhausted during the loop, otherwise it is the remaining value, and `nums` is a list where the first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\) and the subsequent elements are filled with the values `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` is 0, and the rest are 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\), the subsequent elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` is 0, and the rest are 0, making the total length of `nums` equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element is calculated as \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\). The subsequent elements are the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k` until `k` is reduced to 0, and the remaining elements in the list are filled with 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `nums` where the first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\), the subsequent elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` is 0, and the rest are 0, making the total length of `nums` equal to `n`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
