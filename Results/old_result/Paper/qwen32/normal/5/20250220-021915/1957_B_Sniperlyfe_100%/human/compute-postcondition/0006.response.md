To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the statement `k -= nums[i]` on the variables `k` and `nums`.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(n > 1\)
- `k` is now `k - ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)` and `k > 0`
- `nums` is a list of `n` integers where:
  - The first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\)
  - The `i`-th element is `1 << k.bit_length() - 1`
  - The rest are zeros

The statement `k -= nums[i]` will subtract the `i`-th element of `nums` from `k`.

Since the `i`-th element of `nums` is `1 << k.bit_length() - 1`, the new value of `k` will be:
\[ k = k - (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) \]

Let's break down the output state:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` is updated to `k - (1 << k.bit_length() - 1)`.
- `nums` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n > 1\), `k` is now `k - (1 << k.bit_length() - 1)` and `k > 0`, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\), the `i`-th element is `1 << k.bit_length() - 1`, and the rest are zeros.**
