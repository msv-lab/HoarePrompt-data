The code snippet `k -= nums[i]` indicates that the value of `k` is being updated by subtracting the value of `nums[i]` from it. Given the initial state, `nums[i]` is defined as `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. Therefore, the new value of `k` will be `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. 

Since `nums[0]` is not explicitly provided, we can only express `nums[i]` in terms of `nums[0]` and `k`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but since we are only concerned with the state after the execution of the given line, we do not need to update `i` in the output state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(n > 1\), `k` is now `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.**
