To determine the output state, we need to understand the construction of the `nums` list based on the given initial state.

1. **First Element Calculation**: The first element of `nums` is calculated as \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\).
   - \(k.bit_length() - 1\) gives the position of the highest bit in \(k\) minus one.
   - \(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)\) shifts 1 to the left by \(k.bit_length() - 1\) places, effectively creating a binary number with a single 1 at the position of the highest bit of \(k\).
   - Subtracting 1 from this value gives a number with all bits set to 1 up to the position of the highest bit of \(k\).
   - Adding \(k\) to this value gives the first element of `nums`.

2. **Subsequent Elements Calculation**: The subsequent elements of `nums` are filled with the values `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until \(k\) is 0.
   - This means that the value \(min(nums[0] + 1, k)\) is repeatedly added to `nums` until \(k\) is exhausted.

3. **Remaining Elements**: The rest of the elements in `nums` are filled with 0 until the length of `nums` reaches \(n\).

Given the above, the output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` where the first element is \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k\), the subsequent elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` until `k` is 0, and the rest are 0, making the total length of `nums` equal to `n`.**
