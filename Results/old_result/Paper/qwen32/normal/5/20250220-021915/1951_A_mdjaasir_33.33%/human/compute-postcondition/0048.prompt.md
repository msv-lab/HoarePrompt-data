Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    count = a.count('1')
    if count == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count > 2 and count % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif count == 2:
        if a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, and `count` is the number of '1's in `a`. If `count` is 0, there are no '1's in `a`. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the conditions remain as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `count` is either less than or equal to 2 or odd. If `count` is equal to 2, the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is either not immediately followed by another '1' or is at the last position of the string. Otherwise, `count` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `count` is 0, the program executes the if block. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the program executes the if block. If `count` is 2, the program checks if the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not followed by another '1', but regardless of this check, the variables maintain their described properties. If `count` is not greater than 2 or is odd, the program executes the else block, and the variables maintain their described properties.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input value, and `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. Regardless of whether `count` is 0 or greater than 2 and even, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count` remain unchanged except for `i` which is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
