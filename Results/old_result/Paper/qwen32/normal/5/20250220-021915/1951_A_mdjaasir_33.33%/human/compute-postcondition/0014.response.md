Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, and `count` is the number of '1's in `a`. Additionally, `count` is equal to 2, and either the first '1' in `a` is at the last position or the element immediately following the first '1' is also '1'.**
