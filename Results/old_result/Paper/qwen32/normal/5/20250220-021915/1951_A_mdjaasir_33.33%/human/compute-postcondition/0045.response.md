Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input value, and `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. Regardless of whether `count` equals 2 or not, the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count` remain unchanged except for `i` which is incremented by 1.**
