Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input value, and `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`.**

The postcondition indicates that regardless of whether the condition `a.index('1') and a[a.index('1') + 1] != '1'` is true or false, the variables `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count` retain their described states after the execution of the if-else block.
