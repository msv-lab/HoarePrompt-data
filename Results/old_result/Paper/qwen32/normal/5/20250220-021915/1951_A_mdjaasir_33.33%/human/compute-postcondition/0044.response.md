The given `print` statement is `print('NO')`. This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables `i`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `count` as described in the initial state. None of these variables are used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Output: **NO**
