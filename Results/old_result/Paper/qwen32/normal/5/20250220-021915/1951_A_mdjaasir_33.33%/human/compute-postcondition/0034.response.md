Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start <= end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value of the user input, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `count` is 0, the program executes the if block. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the program executes the if block. If `count` is 2, the program checks if the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is not followed by another '1', but regardless of this check, the variables maintain their described properties. If `count` is not greater than 2 or is odd, the program executes the else block, and the variables maintain their described properties.**
