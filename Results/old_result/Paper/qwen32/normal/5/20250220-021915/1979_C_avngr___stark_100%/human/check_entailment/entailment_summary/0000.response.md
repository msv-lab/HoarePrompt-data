### Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it meets the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires us to determine a distribution of bets such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received in any winning scenario. 

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the provided solution:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Finding the LCM**: The function `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k`. This is done by iteratively applying the `func_1` function, which calculates the LCM of two numbers using their greatest common divisor (GCD).

3. **Calculating Bets**: The program then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier `k[i]`. This ensures that the total sum of the bets is less than the LCM.

4. **Checking Feasibility**: The program checks if the total sum of the calculated bets is less than the LCM. If the sum is not less than the LCM, it outputs `-1` indicating that it's not possible to distribute the bets as required.

5. **Output**: If the bets are feasible, the program outputs the calculated bets for each outcome.

### Verification:
Let's verify if this approach works correctly:
- The bets are calculated such that `c[i] = LCM / k[i]`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the return `k[i] * c[i]` equals the LCM, which is strictly greater than the total sum of bets `sum(c)`.
- If the sum of the bets is not less than the LCM, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received in any winning scenario, and it handles the edge cases where no feasible distribution of bets is possible.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
