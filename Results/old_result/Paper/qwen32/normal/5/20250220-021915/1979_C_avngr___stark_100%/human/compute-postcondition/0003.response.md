The only variable in the loop head is `num`, which iterates over `numbers[1:]`. This means that `num` takes the value of each element in the list `numbers` starting from the second element (index 1).

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` had the value of the current element from `numbers[1:]`. To execute the next iteration, `num` needs to take the value of the next element in the list.

Given that `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `num` has just taken the value of the current element, for the next iteration, `num` should take the value of the next element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `result` is the output of `func_1(result, num)`; `num` is the next element in `numbers` after the current `num`**.

Since we do not have the specific values of `numbers` or `num`, we cannot specify the exact value of `num` for the next iteration, but we know it will be the subsequent element in the list.
