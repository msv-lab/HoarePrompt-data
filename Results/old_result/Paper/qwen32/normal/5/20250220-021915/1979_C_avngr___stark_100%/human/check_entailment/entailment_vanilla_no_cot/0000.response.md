To determine if the provided Python program is correct based on the problem description, we need to understand what the program is supposed to do and whether it achieves that.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to distribute bets on `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Mathematically, if we bet `x_i` on the `i-th` outcome, the total bet `sum(x_i)` should be less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program includes two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`. It does this by using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.
2. `func_2(numbers)`: This function computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the numbers in the list.

However, the provided code does not actually solve the problem described. The LCM calculations do not directly help in distributing the bets in a way that satisfies the problem's conditions. The problem requires finding specific values for `x_i` that meet the criteria, and the provided code does not attempt to do this.

### Correct Solution Approach:
A correct solution would involve finding a set of `x_i` values such that:
- `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
- Each `x_i` is a positive integer.

One possible approach is to set each `x_i` to the LCM of all `k_j` values divided by `k_i` (plus a small adjustment to ensure the inequality holds strictly). This ensures that `k_i * x_i` is always greater than the total bet.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not contain the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
