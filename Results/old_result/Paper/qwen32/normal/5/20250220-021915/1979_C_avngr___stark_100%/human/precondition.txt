The function `lcm(a, b)` is not directly related to the problem description provided, which is about distributing coins for a game with multiple outcomes. However, based on the problem description alone, we can infer the following: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a list of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 <= k_i <= 20. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
