To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to generate an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If it's impossible, we should return `-1`.

### Code Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it calls `func_1` with `n - 1` (where `n` is the given `X`). The function `func_1` recursively constructs a sequence that is supposed to have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Function Summary Recap:
- `func_1` takes an integer `number` and a list `sequence`.
- It finds the largest `size` such that `2^(size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`.
- It appends `size` elements to `sequence` (0 to `size - 1`).
- It recursively processes the remaining part of `number` (`number - 2^size + 1`).
- It adjusts the elements in `sequence` to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences are formed.
- It returns the size of the generated sequence.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Base Case**: If `number` is 0, it returns 0.
2. **Determine Size**: The program calculates the largest `size` such that `2^(size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This is equivalent to finding the highest bit position in the binary representation of `number`.
3. **Append Elements**: It appends `size` elements (0 to `size - 1`) to the sequence.
4. **Recursive Call**: It recursively calls `func_1` with the adjusted `number` (`number - 2^size + 1`).
5. **Adjust Elements**: It adjusts the elements in the sequence to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences are formed.

### Verification:
The key idea is to use the binary representation of `X - 1` to determine the number of increasing subsequences. This is based on the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in a binary tree-like structure can be related to the binary representation of the number of subsequences.

Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **X = 2**:
   - `number = 1`
   - `size = 1` (since `2^(1+1) - 1 = 3 > 1` and `2^(1) - 1 = 1 <= 1`)
   - Append `[0]` to the sequence.
   - `number - 2^1 + 1 = 0` -> Base case returns 0.
   - No adjustments needed.
   - Sequence: `[0]` -> Number of increasing subsequences: 2 (empty and `[0]`).

2. **X = 5**:
   - `number = 4`
   - `size = 2` (since `2^(2+1) - 1 = 7 > 4` and `2^(2) - 1 = 3 <= 4`)
   - Append `[0, 1]` to the sequence.
   - `number - 2^2 + 1 = 1`
   - For `number = 1`:
     - `size = 1`
     - Append `[0]` to the sequence.
     - `number - 2^1 + 1 = 0` -> Base case returns 0.
     - Adjust elements: `sequence[-1 - 0 - 1] += 1` -> `[0, 1, 1]`.
   - Adjust elements: `sequence[-1 - 0 - 1] += 2` -> `[0, 3, 1]`.
   - Sequence: `[0, 3, 1]` -> Number of increasing subsequences: 5.

3. **X = 13**:
   - `number = 12`
   - `size = 3` (since `2^(3+1) - 1 = 15 > 12` and `2^(3) - 1 = 7 <= 12`)
   - Append `[0, 1, 2]` to the sequence.
   - `number - 2^3 + 1 = 5`
   - For `number = 5`:
     - `size = 2`
     - Append `[0, 1]` to the sequence.
     - `number - 2^2 + 1 = 1`
     - For `number = 1`:
       - `size = 1`
       - Append `[0]` to the sequence.
       - `number - 2^1 + 1 = 0` -> Base case returns 0.
       - Adjust elements: `sequence[-1 - 0 - 1] += 1` -> `[0, 1, 2, 0]`.
     - Adjust elements: `sequence[-1 - 0 - 1] += 2` -> `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - Adjust elements: `sequence[-1 - 0 - 1] += 4` -> `[0, 5, 2, 3]`.
   - Sequence: `[0, 5, 2, 3]` -> Number of increasing subsequences: 13.

4. **X = 37**:
   - `number = 36`
   - `size = 5` (since `2^(5+1) - 1 = 63 > 36` and `2^(5) - 1 = 31 <= 36`)
   - Append `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` to the sequence.
   - `number - 2^5 + 1 = 5`
   - For `number = 5`:
     - `size = 2`
     - Append `[0, 1]` to the sequence.
     - `number - 2^2 + 1 = 1`
     - For `number = 1`:
       - `size = 1`
       - Append `[0]` to the sequence.
       - `number - 2^1 + 1 = 0` -> Base case returns 0.
       - Adjust elements: `sequence[-1 - 0 - 1] += 1` -> `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0]`.
     - Adjust elements: `sequence[-1 - 0 - 1] += 2` -> `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3]`.
   - Adjust elements: `sequence[-1 - 0 - 1] += 4` -> `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7]`.
   - Adjust elements: `sequence[-1 - 0 - 1] += 8` -> `[0, 9, 2, 3, 4, 7]`.
   - Sequence: `[0, 9, 2, 3, 4, 7]` -> Number of increasing subsequences: 37.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates sequences that have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for the given test cases. The logic and the recursive approach used in `func_1` are consistent with the problem requirements.

**Final: True**
