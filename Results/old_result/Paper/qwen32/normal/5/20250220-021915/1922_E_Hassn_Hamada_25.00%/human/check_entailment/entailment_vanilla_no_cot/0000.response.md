Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for each test case. The approach used in the program involves recursively constructing the sequence based on the binary representation of \( X-1 \). This is a known method to generate a sequence with a specific number of increasing subsequences. 

The function `func_1` is responsible for constructing the sequence, and the main loop reads the number of test cases and applies this function to each input \( X \). The program asserts that the number is non-negative and handles the base case where the number is 0. It also correctly adjusts the sequence based on the results of the recursive calls.

The output format matches the problem's requirements, and the program handles the constraints appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description.
