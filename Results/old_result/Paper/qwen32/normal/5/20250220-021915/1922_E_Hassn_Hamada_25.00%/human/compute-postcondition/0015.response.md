Output State: **`number` is 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, with an additional integer `i` appended to it, `size` is 9, `i` is 8, and the integer `8` has been appended to `sequence`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `number` remains 1000, `sequence` now includes an additional integer `8` at the end, `size` remains 9, and `i` remains 8.
