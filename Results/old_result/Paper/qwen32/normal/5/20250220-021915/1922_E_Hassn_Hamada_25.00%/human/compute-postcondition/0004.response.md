Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case. `size` is 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `size` has been set to 1. The other variables, `number` and `sequence`, remain unchanged.
