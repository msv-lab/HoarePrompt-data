Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the output state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `number` is 1000
- `sequence` has its element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result`
- `size` is 9
- `result` is the output of `func_1(489, sequence)`
- `i` is 3

The code snippet is:
```python
sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
```

First, identify the affected variable: `sequence`. The element at the index `-result - i - 1` of `sequence` is incremented by `result`.

Given:
- `i` is 3
- The element at index `-result - 3 - 1` of `sequence` is incremented by `result`.

The index of the element being modified is `-result - 4`. The value at this index in `sequence` is incremented by `result`. 

Since the exact value of `result` is not specified, we can only describe the index and the operation performed on it in terms of `result`.

Output State: **`number` is 1000, `sequence` has its element at index `-result - 4` incremented by `result`, `size` is 9, `result` is the output of `func_1(489, sequence), `i` is 3**

In natural language, the output state is: `number` remains 1000, the element at index `-result - 4` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`, `size` remains 9, `result` remains the output of `func_1(489, sequence)`, and `i` remains 3.
