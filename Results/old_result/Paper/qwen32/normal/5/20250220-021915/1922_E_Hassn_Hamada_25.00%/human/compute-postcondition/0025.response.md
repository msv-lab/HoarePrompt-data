To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` given the initial state.

Given:
- `number` is 1000
- `sequence` has its element at index `-result - 4` incremented by `result`
- `size` is 9
- `result` is the output of `func_1(489, sequence)`
- `i` is 4

Let's break down the expression `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result`:

1. The index being accessed is `-result - i - 1`.
2. The value at this index in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.

Since `i` is 4, the index becomes `-result - 4 - 1 = -result - 5`.

We need to know the value of `result` to determine the exact index and the effect on `sequence`. However, the problem does not specify the implementation of `func_1`, so we can only express the final state in terms of `result`.

The element at index `-result - 5` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.

Output State: **`number` is 1000, `sequence` has its element at index `-result - 5` incremented by `result`, `size` is 9, `result` is the output of `func_1(489, sequence), `i` is 4**.

In natural language: The element at index `-result - 5` in `sequence` is increased by `result`. The values of `number`, `size`, `result`, and `i` remain unchanged.
