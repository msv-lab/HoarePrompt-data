To determine the output state, let's break down the code execution and the impact on the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `number` is 1000
   - `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, with the integers 0 through 8 appended to it.
   - `size` is 9
   - `result` is the output of `func_1(489, sequence)`

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code modifies the `sequence` list by incrementing a specific element by the value of `result`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - The `sequence` list is modified. Specifically, the element at the index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result`.
   - `number`, `size`, and `result` remain unchanged.

**Output State:**
- `number` is 1000
- `sequence` has its element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result`.
- `size` is 9
- `result` is the output of `func_1(489, sequence)`

To express this in the required format:

Output State: **`number` is 1000, `sequence` has its element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result`, `size` is 9, `result` is the output of `func_1(489, sequence)`**
