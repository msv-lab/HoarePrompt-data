To determine if the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to evaluate the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This condition checks whether the value of `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`.

First, let's break down the expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1`:
- `1 << size + 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which means `1` is shifted left by `size + 1` positions. This is equivalent to `2^(size + 1)`.
- Subtracting `1` from `2^(size + 1)` gives us `2^(size + 1) - 1`.

Given that `size` is initially `1`, we can calculate:
- `1 << size + 1` becomes `1 << 1 + 1` which is `1 << 2` or `4`.
- `(1 << 2) - 1` is `4 - 1` which equals `3`.

So, the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` translates to `3 <= number`.

Since `number` is an integer representing the number of test cases with the constraint `1 ≤ number ≤ 1000`, the condition `3 <= number` can be satisfied if `number` is adjusted to be at least `3`.

Given that `size` is fixed at `1` and does not need to be adjusted, we only need to adjust `number` to be at least `3`.

State: **`number` must be at least 3, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, `size` is 1**
