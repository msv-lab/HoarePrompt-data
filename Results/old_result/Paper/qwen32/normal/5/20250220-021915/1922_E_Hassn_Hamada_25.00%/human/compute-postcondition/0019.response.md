The code snippet calculates a new value for `result` by calling the function `func_1` with two arguments: `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. Given the initial state, `number` is 1000 and `size` is 9. Therefore, the first argument to `func_1` becomes `1000 - (1 << 9) + 1`, which simplifies to `1000 - 512 + 1 = 489`.

The value of `sequence` remains unchanged as it is simply passed as the second argument to `func_1`.

Output State: **`number` is 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) represents the number of increasing subsequences required for the corresponding test case, with the integers 0 through 8 appended to it, `size` is 9, `result` is the output of `func_1(489, sequence)`**.
