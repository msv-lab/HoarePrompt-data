To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to focus on the expression inside the `print` function: `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.

Based on the initial state provided, we know that `n` is an input integer greater than 0. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified. The expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 distinct elements from `n` elements, which is a combinatorial formula often denoted as "n choose 3" or \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Since the exact value of `n` is not given, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for the expression. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (where n is an input integer greater than 0)**
