To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which includes the variable `j` and the range `(1, eta_ln)`. For the loop to execute, the range `(1, eta_ln)` must contain at least one integer. This means `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3
- `buffer` is an empty list
- `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive
- `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`
- `j` is `n`
- `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to n) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0
- `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`
- `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`
- `eta_ln` is not equal to 1
- `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`

The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `eta_ln`. Since `j` is initialized to `n` and is not directly used in the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The critical variable here is `eta_ln`, which must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `eta_ln` to ensure it is greater than 1. All other states are either not directly involved in the loop condition or are already set in a way that does not conflict with the loop execution.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element at index `w[j]` has been incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to n) for which `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is greater than 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`**
