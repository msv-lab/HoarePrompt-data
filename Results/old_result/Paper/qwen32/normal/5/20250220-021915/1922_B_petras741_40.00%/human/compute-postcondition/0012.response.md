The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`, which means the loop has just finished executing for the last time (since `j` started from `0` and incremented by `1` each iteration until it reached `n`).

To execute the loop one more time, `j` would need to be reset to `0` (or any value less than `n`), but since we are only considering the state at the start of the next iteration and the loop has just finished, the correct state to represent the start of the loop would be when `j` is `0`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer and the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `w[n]` has been incremented by 1, `j` is 0**
