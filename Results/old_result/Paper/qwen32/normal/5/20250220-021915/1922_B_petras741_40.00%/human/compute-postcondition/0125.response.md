The code snippet `eta = []` reassigns the variable `eta` to be an empty list, discarding its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at key `w[j]` incremented by 1 for all `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `eta` is an empty list, `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, `rho` is defined based on the conditions given, `res` is defined based on the conditions given, `j` is `n`.**
