Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a new list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `q` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n` and the value at each key `w[j]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `j` in the range of `n`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `eta` is a list containing exactly one key from `q` for which `q[j] > 0`, and `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `eta` is a list containing all keys from `q` for which `q[j] > 0`, `eta_ln` is the number of keys in `q` that have a value greater than 0, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for `j` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is the sum of the initial `res` value and the terms `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.**
