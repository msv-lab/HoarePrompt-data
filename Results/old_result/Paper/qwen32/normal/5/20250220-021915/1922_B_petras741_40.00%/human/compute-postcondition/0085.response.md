The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. This expression calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `n` items without regard to order, which is also known as the binomial coefficient "n choose 3" or mathematically represented as \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Given the initial state, `n` is greater than 0. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified. Therefore, the output of the print statement will depend on the value of `n`.

Since we don't have a specific value for `n`, we can describe the output in terms of `n`:

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6 (which is the number of ways to choose 3 items from n items without regard to order)**
