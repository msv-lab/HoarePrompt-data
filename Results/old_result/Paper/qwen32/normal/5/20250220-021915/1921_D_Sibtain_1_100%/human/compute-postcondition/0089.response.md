Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the final value after all comparisons, `j` is the final value after all comparisons. If `len(a)` is 1, no specific changes are made to the variables described. If `len(a)` is greater than 1, the condition checks if all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and `a[0]` equals `c[0]`. If the condition is satisfied, no specific changes are made to the variables described.**
