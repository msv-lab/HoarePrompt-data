The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the last elements of the sorted list `a` and the sorted list `c` in descending order, and assigns this value to `t2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`**.
