Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. a_i is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. b_i is a list of m integers where each b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
        print(0)
        continue
    a.sort()
    c.sort(reverse=True)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
        continue
    i, j, ans = 0, 1, 0
    for k in range(len(a)):
        t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
        t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
        if t2 > t1:
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        ans += max(t1, t2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with a length of at least 1; `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times `t1` was the maximum or equal to `t2` during the iterations; `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` during the iterations; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair considered; `k` is equal to `len(a)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the final value after all comparisons, `j` is the final value after all comparisons.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and m are integers read from input, a is a sorted list of integers read from input with len(a) > 0, c is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, ans is the sum of max(t1, t2) for all iterations, k is len(a) - 1, i and j are within the bounds of the list indices.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
