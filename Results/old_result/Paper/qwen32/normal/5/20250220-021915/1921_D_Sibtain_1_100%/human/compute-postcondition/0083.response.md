The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or their values directly; it simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `ans`, `k`, `i`, `j`) are modified by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the final value after all comparisons, `j` is the final value after all comparisons.**
