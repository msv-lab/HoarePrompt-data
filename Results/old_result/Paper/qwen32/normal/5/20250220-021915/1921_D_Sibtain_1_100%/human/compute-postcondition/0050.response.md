The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Since the provided code snippet only contains a `continue` statement and no loop context is given, the `continue` statement does not have any impact on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`) are modified by this statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input; `c` is a list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order; `i` is the number of times `t1` was the maximum or equal to `t2` during the iterations; `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` during the iterations; `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences for each pair considered; `k` is equal to `len(a)`. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same and the single element in `a` is equal to the single element in `c`, the condition is satisfied; otherwise, no specific change is made to the variables.**
