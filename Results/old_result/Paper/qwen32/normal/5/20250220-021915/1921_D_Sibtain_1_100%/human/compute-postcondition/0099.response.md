The code snippet `ans += max(t1, t2)` will add the maximum value between `t1` and `t2` to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` was initially 0, `ans` will now hold the value of `max(t1, t2)`.

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `c`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1.**
