Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is 0, `k` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`, and `t2` is greater than `t1`.**

The value of `j` has been incremented by 1, so `j` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
