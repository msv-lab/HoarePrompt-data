The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` and `m` are integers read from input; `a` is a list of integers read from input, and all elements in `a` are the same; `c` is a list of integers read from input, and all elements in `c` are the same; the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.**
