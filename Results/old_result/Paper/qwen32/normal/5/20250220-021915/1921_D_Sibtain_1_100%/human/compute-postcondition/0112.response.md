Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers read from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input with `len(a) > 0`, `c` is a list of integers read from input sorted in descending order, `ans` is `2 * max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, and `t2` has been recalculated based on the current values of `a`, `c`, and `j`. If `t2 > t1`, then `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is 3. If `t2 <= t1`, then `i` is 2, and `j` is either 1 or 2.**
