The code updates the value of `p1` by recalculating it based on the squared differences of the x and y coordinates of the points `coord[1]` and `coord[0]`. The new value of `p1` is the sum of the squares of these differences. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is the sorted list of `[(x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**
