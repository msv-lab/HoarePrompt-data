To determine what will be printed by the `print(res)` statement, we need to break down the initial state and the calculations step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `n` is a non-zero integer.
- `coord` is a sorted list of tuples: `[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4)]`.
- `res` is calculated as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.
- `i` is 3.
- `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, which is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`.
- `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, which is the difference between the x-coordinates of the fourth and third points in `coord`.

### Calculation of `res`:
- `p1` is the difference in the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`.
- `p2` is the difference in the x-coordinates of the fourth and third points in `coord`.
- `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume some specific values for `coord` to illustrate the calculation:
- `coord = [(1, 1), (3, 2), (5, 3), (7, 4)]`

Then:
- `p1 = coord[1][0] - coord[0][0] = 3 - 1 = 2`
- `p2 = coord[3][0] - coord[2][0] = 7 - 5 = 2`
- `res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)) = abs(math.sqrt(2) * math.sqrt(2)) = abs(2) = 2`

### General Output:
Given the initial state and the calculations, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of the differences in the x-coordinates of the second-first and fourth-third points in the `coord` list.

Output: **res (where res is abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)), p1 is (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]), and p2 is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]))**
