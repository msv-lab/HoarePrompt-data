The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state indicates that `t`, `n`, `coord`, and `res` are already defined and their values are not affected by this specific line of code. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` will be the integers read from the input, and all other variables will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero integer, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input.**
