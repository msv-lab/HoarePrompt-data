Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly calculating the area of the square:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, but this does not guarantee that the sorted order will place the points in a way that allows for correct distance calculations between adjacent corners of the square. The sorting is done lexicographically, which does not align with the arrangement of the square's corners.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points (p1 and p2) and then multiplies their square roots to get the area. This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that the points being measured are adjacent corners of the square. The correct approach should be to calculate the distance between two adjacent corners and then square that distance to get the area.

3. **Use of Absolute Value**: The use of `abs()` is unnecessary for the product of two positive distances.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate all distances between points
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i + 1, 4):
                dx = coord[j][0] - coord[i][0]
                dy = coord[j][1] - coord[i][1]
                distances.append(dx * dx + dy * dy)
        
        # Sort distances to find the smallest (side of the square) and the largest (diagonal of the square)
        distances.sort()
        
        # The area of the square is the side length squared
        side_length_squared = distances[0]
        area = side_length_squared
        
        print(area)
        n -= 1

func()
```

This corrected program calculates all possible distances between the points, sorts them, and uses the smallest distance (which corresponds to the side of the square) to compute the area.
