The code snippet calculates the value of `p2` based on the elements of the `coord` list. The variables `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, and `p1` are not affected by the code snippet provided. The variable `p2` is assigned the value of the squared difference of the x-coordinates plus the squared difference of the y-coordinates between the fourth and third elements of the `coord` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero value, `coord` is a sorted list with 4 elements, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2`.**
