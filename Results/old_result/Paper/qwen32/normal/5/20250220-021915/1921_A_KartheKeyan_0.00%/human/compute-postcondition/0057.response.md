To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the variables involved:

1. `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
2. `n` is a non-zero value, but its exact value is not specified.
3. `coord` is a sorted list with 4 elements. Since `coord` is sorted, we can assume it contains numerical values, likely coordinates.
4. `res` is calculated as `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.
5. `i` is set to 3.
6. `p1` is calculated as `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`.
7. `p2` is calculated as `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.

Let's analyze the calculation of `res` step by step:

- `p1` is the difference between the first elements of the second and first elements in `coord`, i.e., `coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]`.
- `p2` is the difference between the first elements of the fourth and third elements in `coord`, i.e., `coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]`.
- `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

Since the exact values of `coord` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, we can describe `res` in terms of the elements in `coord`.

Output: **res (where res is abs(math.sqrt(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) * math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])))**
