The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one element `[(x, y)]`. After appending, `coord` will contain two elements: `[(x, y), (x, y)]`.

The variables `p1` and `p2` remain undefined because `coord` does not have enough elements to define them. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `res`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is 1, `coord` is `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 1, `p1` is undefined, `p2` is undefined, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.**
