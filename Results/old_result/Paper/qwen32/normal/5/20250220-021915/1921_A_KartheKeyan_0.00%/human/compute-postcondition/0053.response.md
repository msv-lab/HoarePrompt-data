The code sorts the list `coord`. This operation changes the order of elements in `coord` but does not affect the other variables. The values of `t`, `n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The new `coord` list will be in ascending order based on the elements' values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is a non-zero value, `coord` is a sorted list with 4 elements, `res` is 0, `i` is 3, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`.**
