Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`. It performs a binary search on the list `arr` to find the integer `k` within the specified range defined by `low` and `high`. The function uses the set `st` to keep track of visited midpoints during the search. If `k` is found in `arr` at index `pos`, the function returns `pos`. If `k` is not found, the function returns -1 indicating that `k` is not present in the list.**
