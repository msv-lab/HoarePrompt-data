Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `low` is `n // 2`, `high` is `n // 2 + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `low` is updated to be equal to `mid`, which is `n // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
