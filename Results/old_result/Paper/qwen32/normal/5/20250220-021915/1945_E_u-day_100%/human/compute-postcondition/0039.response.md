Postcondition: **`low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the `mid` values checked during the binary search, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`. Additionally, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.**
