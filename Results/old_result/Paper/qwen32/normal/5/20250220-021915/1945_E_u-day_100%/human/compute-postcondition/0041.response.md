To determine the output of the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the roles of the variables involved.

### Analysis:

1. **`low`**: This variable is defined as the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`. Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it means `arr[low] < k`.

2. **`high`**: This variable is defined as the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`. The value of `high` is not directly used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for this specific output.

3. **`st`**: This contains all the `mid` values checked during the binary search. The exact values are not needed for determining the output of the `print` statement.

4. **`pos`**: This variable is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found. Since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, and `low` is the largest index where the element is less than `k`, `pos` could be -1 if `k` is not in `arr`.

5. **`n` and `k`**: These are values returned by `func_1()`. Since `k` is also used in the binary search, it is the key we are searching for in `arr`.

6. **`arr`**: This is the list returned by `func_2()`. The exact elements of the list are not provided, but we know the relationships between the elements and the value `k`.

### Output Derivation:

- **`low + 1`**: Since `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] < k`, `low + 1` will be the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `k`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `low + 1` will point to the position where `k` would be inserted to keep the list sorted.

- **`pos + 1`**: Since `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `pos + 1` will be the position (1-based index) of the first occurrence of `k`. If `k` is not found, `pos + 1` will be 0.

### Conclusion:

Given the conditions, the `print` statement will output `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. Specifically:

- `low + 1` is the 1-based index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `pos + 1` is the 1-based index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or 0 if `k` is not found.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **low + 1, pos + 1 (where low + 1 is the 1-based index of the first element in arr that is greater than or equal to k, and pos + 1 is the 1-based index of the first occurrence of k in arr, or 0 if k is not found)**
