Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always ensure that the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` after performing at most 2 swaps. The algorithm simply finds one occurrence of `x` and attempts to place it in a position where it would be found by binary search, but it does not guarantee that the array can be made sorted enough with just 2 swaps for binary search to work correctly in all cases.

The binary search algorithm relies on the array being sorted to function correctly. The current implementation only ensures that after one swap, the element `x` is at a position that would be considered by the binary search, but it does not ensure that the entire array is in a state that binary search can handle.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed that ensures the array can be made sortable with at most 2 swaps, and the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x`.
