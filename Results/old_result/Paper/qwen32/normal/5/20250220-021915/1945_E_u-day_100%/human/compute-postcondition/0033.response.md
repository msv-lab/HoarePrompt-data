The code snippet sets `high` to the value of `mid`. Since `mid` is defined as `n // 2`, the value of `high` is also updated to `n // 2`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `low` is `mid - 1`, `high` is `n // 2`.**
