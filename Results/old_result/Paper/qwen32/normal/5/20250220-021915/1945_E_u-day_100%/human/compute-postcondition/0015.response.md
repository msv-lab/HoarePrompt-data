The code snippet provided is simply reassigning the variable `st` to an empty set. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, or any other variable except `st`.

Output State: **`n` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `n`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `k`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `st` is an empty set.**
