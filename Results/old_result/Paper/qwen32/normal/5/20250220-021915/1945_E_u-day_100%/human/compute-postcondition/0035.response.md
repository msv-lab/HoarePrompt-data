Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is `mid - 1` and `high` is `n // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `n // 2` and `high` is `mid + 1`.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, taking into account the condition and the changes made in each part.
