You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer representing the number to be found in the permutation, arr is a list of integers representing the permutation, pos is an integer representing the index of k in arr, low and high are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and st is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: `n` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `n`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `k`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` and `high` are integers representing the current search range in the binary search algorithm, and `st` is a set used to keep track of visited midpoints during the binary search.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the `mid` values checked during the binary search, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, pos + 1 (where low + 1 is the 1-based index of the first element in arr that is greater than or equal to k, and pos + 1 is the 1-based index of the first occurrence of k in arr, or 0 if k is not found)
    #State: `low` is the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, `high` is the smallest index such that `arr[high] > k`, `st` contains all the `mid` values checked during the binary search, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `n` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, then `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. Otherwise, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, and `st`. It performs a binary search on the list `arr` to find the integer `k` within the specified range defined by `low` and `high`. The function uses the set `st` to keep track of visited midpoints during the search. If `k` is found in `arr` at index `pos`, the function returns `pos`. If `k` is not found, the function returns -1 indicating that `k` is not present in the list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
