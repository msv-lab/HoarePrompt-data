Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is set to `n // 2`. Otherwise, `high` is set to `n // 2`.**
