The code `st.add(mid)` adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Given that `mid` is already an element of `st` (as per the initial state where `st` contains `n // 2` and `mid`, and `mid` is `n // 2`), adding `mid` again does not change the set `st` because sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with respect to the variables mentioned.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `st` is a set containing `n // 2` and `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `low` is `mid - 1`, `high` is `mid + 1`**
