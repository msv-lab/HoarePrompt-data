Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to arrange the permutation in such a way that after a binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
- The binary search algorithm is given and should end with `p[l] == x`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads a line of input and returns a map of integers.
   - The function `func_2()` reads another line of input and returns a list of integers.
   - The function `func_3()` reads the number of elements `n` and the target `x`, followed by the permutation `arr`.

2. **Finding the Target Position**:
   - The program finds the index `pos` of the target `x` in the permutation `arr`.

3. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   - The program initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n`.
   - It then performs a binary search, keeping track of the midpoints in a set `st`.
   - If the element at the midpoint `mid` is greater than `x`, it updates `high` to `mid`; otherwise, it updates `low` to `mid`.
   - If the element at `low` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - Otherwise, it prints `1` indicating one swap is needed, and it suggests swapping the elements at positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is implemented correctly, but the program assumes that only one swap is needed if `p[low] != x` after the search.
   - This is not always true. The problem states that up to 2 swaps are allowed, and it can be shown that 2 swaps are always sufficient, but the program does not handle the case where one swap is insufficient.

2. **Handling the Case of Two Swaps**:
   - The program does not consider the scenario where two swaps are necessary to position the target `x` correctly after the binary search.
   - The provided solution does not account for the possibility of needing to adjust multiple elements to ensure the binary search ends with `p[l] == x`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the permutation is already sorted or nearly sorted, which might require different strategies for swapping.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is not correct because it does not always ensure that `p[l] == x` after the binary search, especially when more than one swap is needed. The program only handles the case where one swap is sufficient, which is not always the case.

**Correctness: False**
