To determine the necessary adjustments for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `low + 1 < high`. Here are the variables involved in this condition: `low` and `high`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `n`
- `k` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `k`
- `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`
- `st` is an empty set

The loop condition `low + 1 < high` must be true for the loop to execute. Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, the condition becomes `0 + 1 < n`, which simplifies to `1 < n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

No other variables (`k`, `arr`, `pos`, `st`) need to be adjusted because they do not appear in the loop condition.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the value returned by `func_1()` for `k`, `arr` is the list returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not found, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, and `st` is an empty set**
