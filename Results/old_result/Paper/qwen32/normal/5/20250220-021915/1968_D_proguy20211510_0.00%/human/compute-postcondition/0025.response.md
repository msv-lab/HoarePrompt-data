The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is False, `foundb` is False, `i` is 0**
