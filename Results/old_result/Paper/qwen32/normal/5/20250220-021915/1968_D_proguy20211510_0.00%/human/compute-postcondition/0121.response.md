The code appends a new value to the `ptsb` list. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, where `i` is `1` and `rem` is `k - 2`. Therefore, the new value appended to `ptsb` is `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1]`, `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `1`, `ptsb` is `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1], pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]]`, `rem` is `k - 2`**.
