Output State: **`preb` is the cumulative sums of `b`, `pres` is a list with at least one element, `sb` is `sum(b)`, `ss` is `sum(s)`, `i` is `len(s) - 1`, `ptsb` is `ptsb` with an additional element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, `ptss` is `ptss` with an additional element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `ptss` has been updated by appending the value `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` to it. All other variables retain their previous values.
