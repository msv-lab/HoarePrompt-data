The code snippet `s.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. This means that the length of `s` increases by 1, and the last element of `s` becomes `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly dependent on `s` or its length.

Given the initial state, `s` is a list that includes the cumulative sums of its elements up to the last element. After appending `maxa`, the new last element of `s` is `maxa`, and the cumulative sums in `pres` need to be recalculated to include this new element.

However, the provided initial state does not specify the exact values of `s` or `pres`, so we will only reflect the direct change to `s` and note that `pres` and `ss` will need to be recalculated, but we do not specify the new values of `pres` and `ss` as they depend on the specific values of `s` before the append operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0] + s[1], ..., s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]]` (needs recalculating), `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise it remains `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1] + b[n]`, `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]` (needs recalculating), `i` is `n`, `ptsb` is updated to `[(sb + maxa + (k - n - 1) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1], (sb + b[n]) + (k - n - 1) * b[n]]` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise it remains `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1], (sb + b[n]) + (k - n - 1) * b[n]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1], pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], ..., pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1]]` (needs recalculating), `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss` (needs recalculating), `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb` (needs recalculating), `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `foundb` is True, and `founds` is a boolean that can be either True or False. If `foundb` is True, `b` now includes an additional element `maxa`, and `s` remains unchanged except `s` now includes `a[ps - 1]` as its last element if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `sb` is updated to `sb + maxa` and `ptsb` is adjusted accordingly. If `foundb` is False, `b` is updated to `b + [a[pb - 1]]` and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` includes `a[ps - 1]` as its last element. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `b` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa` and `s` includes an additional element `(k - (n + 1)) * maxa`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `foundb` and `founds` are both True. `s` is now `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1], maxa]`.**
