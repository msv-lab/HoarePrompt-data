The code appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`. Given the initial state, we know that `i` is `k+1`. Therefore, `preb[i]` is `preb[k+1]`, and `rem` is `-2`. Thus, the new value to be appended is `preb[k+1] + (-2) * b[k+1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k])`, `i` is `k+1`, `ptsb` is `[preb[i-1] + rem * b[i-1], k*maxa - b[k], preb[k+1] - 2 * b[k+1]]`, `ptss` is `[sum(s[0:k]), sum(s[0:k]) - s[k]]`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged, `rem` is `-2`.**

In natural language: The list `ptsb` has a new element appended to it, which is `preb[k+1] - 2 * b[k+1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
