### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the winner of a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, move through a permutation and collect scores based on values in an array. The key logic involves the following steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads multiple test cases, each with the number of elements `n`, the number of turns `k`, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (`P_B` and `P_S`). It also reads the permutation `p` and the score array `a`.

2. **Immediate Win Check**: The program first checks if Bodya or Sasha is already on the position with the maximum score (`maxa`). If both are on the maximum score position, it's a draw. If only one is on the maximum score position, that player wins.

3. **Simulation of Moves**: For each player, the program simulates `k` turns. During each turn:
   - If the player is on a position with the maximum score (`maxa`), they stay there for the remaining turns.
   - Otherwise, they move to the position specified by the permutation `p`.

4. **Score Calculation**: For each player, the program calculates the total score over `k` turns. If a player reaches the maximum score position, they collect the maximum score for the remaining turns.

5. **Determine Winner**: After simulating the moves and calculating the scores, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the immediate win condition efficiently and simulates the moves accurately. The score calculations and the final comparison for determining the winner are also correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
