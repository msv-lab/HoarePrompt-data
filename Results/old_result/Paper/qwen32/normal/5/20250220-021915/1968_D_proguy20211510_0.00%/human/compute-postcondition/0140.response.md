The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides a detailed description of various variables and lists, but none of these variables are used within the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'Draw'` as specified.

Here's the breakdown of the code and the variables:
- `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `i`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, and `maxa` are all defined in the initial state.
- However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print('Draw')` statement.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the defined variables, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Draw**
