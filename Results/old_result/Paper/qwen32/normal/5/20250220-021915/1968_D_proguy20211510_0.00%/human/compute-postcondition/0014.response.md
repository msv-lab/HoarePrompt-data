The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bodya'`. The initial state provides several variables and conditions, but none of these variables are used within the provided `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n` and `k` are integers.
   - `pb` and `ps` are integers.
   - `pb` and `ps` are indices for the lists `p` and `a`.
   - `p` is a list of integers.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`.
   - `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('Bodya')`.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Bodya'`, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` do not affect the output.

Output: **Bodya**
