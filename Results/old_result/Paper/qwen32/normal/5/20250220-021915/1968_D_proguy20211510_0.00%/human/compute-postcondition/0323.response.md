Postcondition: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`. `sb` is `k*maxa`. `i` is `1`. `ptsb` is recalculated based on the updated `preb` and `b`. `maxa` is `max(a)`. `n` is the first value from the input as an integer. `k` is greater than 0. `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`. `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer. `p` is a list of integers read from the input. `a` is a list of integers read from the input. `foundb` is `True`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k]), a[ps - 1]]`, `pres` is recalculated based on the new `s`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k]) + a[ps - 1]`, `ptss` is recalculated based on the new `pres`, `maxs` is recalculated based on the new `ptss`, `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`, `b` includes `maxa` as an additional element, and if `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, `b` also includes `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], a[ps - 1]]`, `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`, and if `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, `b` includes `(k - 2) * maxa` and `s` is `[s[0], s[1], ..., s[k-1], (k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]`. Otherwise, `b` and `s` remain unchanged as described above.**
