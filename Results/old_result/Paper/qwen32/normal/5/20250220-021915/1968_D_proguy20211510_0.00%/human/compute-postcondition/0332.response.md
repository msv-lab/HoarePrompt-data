The given code snippet appends the value `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. This means that the list `b` will now have an additional element at the end, which is the value at index `pb - 1` in the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the value of `pb` is determined based on the condition `a[pb - 1] != maxa`. If this condition is true, `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer. If the condition is false, `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`. Regardless of the value of `pb`, the code appends `a[pb - 1]` to `b`.

After this operation, the list `b` is updated, but all other variables remain unchanged, except for `maxb`, which is recalculated based on the new `ptsb` (which is not directly affected by the appending operation but might be recalculated in the broader context).

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`; `sb` is `k*maxa`; `i` is `2`; `ptsb` is recalculated based on the updated `preb` and `b`; `maxa` is `max(a)`; `n` is the first value from the input as an integer; `k` is greater than 0; `pb` is the third value from the input as an integer if `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, otherwise `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`; `ps` is the fourth value from the input as an integer if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, otherwise `ps` is `p[ps - 1]`; `p` is a list of integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `foundb` is `True`; `founds` is unchanged; `b` is unchanged except it now includes `a[pb - 1]` at the end; `s` is unchanged; `maxb` is recalculated based on the new `ptsb`.**
