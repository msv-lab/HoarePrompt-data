The code snippet provided appends the result of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given the initial state, `s` is a list with at least one element, and `i` is 3. However, `preb`, `sb`, and `b` are not mentioned in the initial state, so we need to infer the changes based on the code.

Since `i` is 3, the code will append `sb + b[3]` to `preb`. The state of `s` remains unchanged, and `i` remains 3. The new state will include the updated `preb` list.

Output State: **`s` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `i` is 3; `preb` now contains an additional element which is the value of `sb + b[3]`.**
