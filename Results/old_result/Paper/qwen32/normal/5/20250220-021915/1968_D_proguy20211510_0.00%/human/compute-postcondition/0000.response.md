The given Python code snippet only initializes two string constants `YES` and `NO` with the values `'YES'` and `'NO'`, respectively. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, or `a`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each testcase, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are integers such that 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `p` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= p_i <= n for all i; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'.**
