The value of `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is `k`, the expression simplifies to `k - (k + 1)`, which equals `-1`. Therefore, `rem` becomes `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`preb` is `[maxa, 2*maxa, 3*maxa, ..., k*maxa]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0]+s[1], s[0]+s[1]+s[2], ..., sum(s[0:k])]`, `sb` is `k*maxa`, `ss` is `sum(s[0:k])`, `i` is `k`, `ptsb` is `[preb[i-1] + rem * b[i-1]]`, `ptss` is `[sum(s[0:k])]`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged, `rem` is `-1`**.
