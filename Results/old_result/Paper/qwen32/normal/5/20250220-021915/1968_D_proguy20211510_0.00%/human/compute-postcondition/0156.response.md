Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0] + s[1], ..., s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]]`, `sb` is `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1]`, `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `ptsb` is `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1], pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], ..., pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1]]`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, then `b` is `[(k - n) * maxa]`, `s` is `[(k - n) * maxa]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `b` and `s` remain unchanged.**
