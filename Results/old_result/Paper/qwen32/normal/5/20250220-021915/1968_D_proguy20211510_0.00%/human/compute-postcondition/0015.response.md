Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, and it is not the case that `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified, the state remains unchanged.
