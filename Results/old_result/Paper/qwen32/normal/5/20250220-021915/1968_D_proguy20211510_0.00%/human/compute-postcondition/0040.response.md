Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` is a boolean value; `i` is 0; `foundb` is a boolean value. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `b` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa, maxa]` and `s` is a list containing `[(k - 1) * maxa]`, and `foundb` is True. Otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `b` is a list containing one element `a[pb - 1]`, and if `founds` is True, `s` contains one element `[(k - 1) * maxa]`, and `foundb` remains False.**
