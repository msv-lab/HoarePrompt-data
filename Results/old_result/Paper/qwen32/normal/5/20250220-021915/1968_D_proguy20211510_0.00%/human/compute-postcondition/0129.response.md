The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bodya'`. The initial state provides detailed descriptions of various variables and their relationships, but none of these variables are involved in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and simply outputs the string `'Bodya'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the `print` statement**: The `print` statement is `print('Bodya')`.
2. **Determine the content to be printed**: The content to be printed is the string `'Bodya'`.
3. **Verify the involvement of variables**: The variables `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `i`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` are described in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Bodya'`, we can conclude the output as follows:

Output: **Bodya**
