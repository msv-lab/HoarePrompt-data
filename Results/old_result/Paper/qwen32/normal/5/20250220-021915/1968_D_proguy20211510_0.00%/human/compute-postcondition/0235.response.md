The code snippet `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by the value of `s[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `ss` is increased by `s[3]`.

Output State: **`s` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `i` is 3; `sb` is now equal to its previous value plus `b[3]`; `preb` now contains an additional element which is the value of `sb + b[3]` at the time `preb` was updated; `pres` now contains an additional element which is the value of `ss + s[3]` before the increment; `ss` is now equal to its previous value plus `s[3]`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ss` has been updated to include `s[3]`, and all other variables remain as they were, except for `ss` which has been incremented.
