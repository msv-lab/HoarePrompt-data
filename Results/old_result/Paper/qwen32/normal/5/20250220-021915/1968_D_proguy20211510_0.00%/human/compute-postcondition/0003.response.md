The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range function, which takes an integer argument derived from `input()`. For the loop to execute, the integer value obtained from `input()` must be at least 1. 

Given the state before the loop starts, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, we can adjust the state to ensure that the loop will execute. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, it is directly related to the number of iterations the loop should perform. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4** (This state already ensures the loop will execute since `t` is the number of iterations and it is guaranteed to be at least 1)
