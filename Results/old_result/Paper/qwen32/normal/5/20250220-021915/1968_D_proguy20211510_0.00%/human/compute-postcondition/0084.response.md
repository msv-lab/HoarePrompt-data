The code snippet `s.append(maxa)` adds the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. This means that the list `s` will now include an additional element, which is the maximum value found in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers; `a` is a list of integers; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` and `foundb` are boolean values; `i` is 2. If `foundb` is True, `b` includes an additional element `a[pb - 1]` or `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and both `foundb` and `founds` are True, `s` includes an additional element `(k - 3) * maxa`. Otherwise, `s` includes an additional element `a[ps - 1]` or `maxa`. `s` now includes an additional element `maxa`.**
