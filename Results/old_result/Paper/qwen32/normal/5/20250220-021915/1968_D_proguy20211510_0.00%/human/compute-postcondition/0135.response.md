The code snippet provided reads four values from the input and splits them into four variables: `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. These variables are not assigned any specific values in the initial state, but after the execution of the code, they will hold the values read from the input.

The other variables (`preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `i`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb`) are not affected by this code snippet and will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an input value, `k` is an input value, `pb` is an input value, `ps` is an input value, `preb` is `[sb + b[0], sb + b[1], ..., sb + b[n-1]]`, `pres` is `[s[0], s[0] + s[1], ..., s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]]`, `sb` is `b[0] + b[1] + ... + b[n-1]`, `ss` is `s[0] + s[1] + ... + s[n-1]`, `i` is `n-1`, `ptsb` is `[(sb + (k - n) * b[n-1]), (sb + b[0]) + (k - 1) * b[0], ..., (sb + b[n-1]) + (k - n) * b[n-1]]`, `ptss` is `[pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1], pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0], ..., pres[n-1] + (k - n) * s[n-1]]`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`**.
