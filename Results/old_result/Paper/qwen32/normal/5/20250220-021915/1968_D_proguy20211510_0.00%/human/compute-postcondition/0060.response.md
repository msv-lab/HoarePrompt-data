The code snippet `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the element at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `b`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that the list `b` is updated by adding a new element, which is `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer greater than 0; `pb` is an integer; `ps` is an integer; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`; `founds` is a boolean value; `foundb` is True; `i` is 1; `b` is a list with an additional element `a[pb - 1]`; `s` is a list with an additional element `(k - 2) * maxa` if `foundb` and `founds` are both True, otherwise `s` remains unchanged.**
