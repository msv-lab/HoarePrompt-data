The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into four parts, assigning them to the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since the input is split into strings, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` will each hold string values representing the input numbers. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the input operation in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a string, `k` is a string, `pb` is a string, `ps` is a string**.
