Output State: **`s` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `preb` has a new element appended, which is the result of `sb + b[i]`; `sb` is now `sb + b[i]`; `pres` has a new element appended, which is `ss + s[i]`; `ss` is now `ss + s[i]`.**

In this output state, the list `s` remains unchanged and must still have at least one element. The list `preb` has a new element appended, which is the result of `sb + b[i]`. Similarly, `sb` is updated to be `sb + b[i]`. The list `pres` has a new element appended, which is `ss + s[i]`. Finally, `ss` is updated to be `ss + s[i]`.
