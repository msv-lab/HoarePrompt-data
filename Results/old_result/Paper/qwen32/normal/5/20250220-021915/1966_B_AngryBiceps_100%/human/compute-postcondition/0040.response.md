The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1` (which means `i` has already been incremented by 1). Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented again by 1 from its current value. Since `n` must be greater than 0 and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`, `n` does not need to be changed.

Given that `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to set `i` to `i + 1` again for the next iteration. However, since we are describing the state at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it will have at the beginning of that iteration, which is the current value of `i` plus 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first input string concatenated with the first character of the second input string, `last_row` is the last character of the first input string concatenated with the last character of the second input string, `i` is `i + 2`**
