To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we should focus on the variables present in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means the only variable we can adjust is `n`.

The loop will execute if and only if `n` is greater than 0. The state of `t`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` does not affect whether the loop can execute, so we only need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.**
