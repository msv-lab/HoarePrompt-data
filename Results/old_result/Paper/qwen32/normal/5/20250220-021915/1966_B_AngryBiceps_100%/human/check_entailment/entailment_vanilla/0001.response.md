Let's analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the given problem.

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color by performing a series of operations where you can select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them that color.

The provided program checks two conditions:
1. If the first and last rows of the grid are the same color but different from each other.
2. If the first and last columns of the grid are the same color but different from each other.

If either of these conditions is true, the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

Let's analyze if these conditions are sufficient to determine if the grid can be made all one color:

1. **First and Last Rows Check**:
   - The program checks if all squares in the first row are the same color and all squares in the last row are the same color, but these colors are different.
   - If this condition is true, it means there's at least one row that is entirely white and at least one row that is entirely black. However, this alone does not necessarily mean it's impossible to make the whole grid one color. For example, if all other rows are also entirely white or entirely black, it might still be possible to make the entire grid one color by performing the operations.

2. **First and Last Columns Check**:
   - Similarly, the program checks if all squares in the first column are the same color and all squares in the last column are the same color, but these colors are different.
   - Again, this condition alone does not guarantee that it's impossible to make the entire grid one color.

The problem can be solved more effectively by checking if there is a single color that appears in every row and every column. If such a color exists, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color by performing the operations.

However, the given program does not perform this check. It only checks the first and last rows and columns. This means that there are cases where the program might output "NO" when it should output "YES".

For example, consider the following grid:
```
WB
BW
```
The program will output "NO" because the first and last rows are not the same color, and the first and last columns are not the same color. However, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color (either all white or all black) by performing the operations.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
