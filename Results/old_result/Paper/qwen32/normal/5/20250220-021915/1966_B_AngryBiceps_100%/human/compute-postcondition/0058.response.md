The code snippet `last_row = ''` sets the variable `last_row` to an empty string. This means that the previous value of `last_row`, which was a string composed of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, is now overwritten to be an empty string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n - 1`.**
