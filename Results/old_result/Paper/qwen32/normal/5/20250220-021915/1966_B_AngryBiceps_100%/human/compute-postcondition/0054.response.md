In this task, the loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop variable here is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable when the variable is not used within the loop body. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the input strings
- `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings
- `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings
- `i` is `n - 1`
- Additional conditions about the contents of `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are provided.

Since the loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body and does not affect the state of the other variables, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is the loop variable itself. The loop will continue to execute as long as the range has not been exhausted. Therefore, the loop variable `_` implicitly keeps track of the number of iterations, and we do not need to adjust any other variables in the provided state.

The state at the start of the next iteration remains the same except for the implicit iteration count which is managed by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements which are the input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each of the `n` input strings, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each of the `n` input strings, `i` is `n - 1`**
