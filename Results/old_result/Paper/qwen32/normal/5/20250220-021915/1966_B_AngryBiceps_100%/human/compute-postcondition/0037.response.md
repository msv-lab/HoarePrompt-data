The code appends a new element to the list `a` by taking an input. This means that the list `a` will now have two elements: the original input string and the newly appended input string. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing two elements which are the input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the first input string, `last_row` is the last character of the first input string, `i` is `i + 1`**
