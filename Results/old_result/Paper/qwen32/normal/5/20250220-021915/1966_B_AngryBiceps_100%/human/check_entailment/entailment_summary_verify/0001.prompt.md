You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each grid, it determines whether the grid meets specific conditions that would result in printing 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The conditions for printing 'NO' are that either the first and last rows are uniform in color but different from each other, or the first and last columns are uniform in color but different from each other.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the given problem.

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color by performing a series of operations where you can select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them that color.

The provided program checks two conditions:
1. If the first and last rows of the grid are the same color but different from each other.
2. If the first and last columns of the grid are the same color but different from each other.

If either of these conditions is true, the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES".

Let's analyze if these conditions are sufficient to determine if the grid can be made all one color:

1. **First and Last Rows Check**:
   - The program checks if all squares in the first row are the same color and all squares in the last row are the same color, but these colors are different.
   - If this condition is true, it means there's at least one row that is entirely white and at least one row that is entirely black. However, this alone does not necessarily mean it's impossible to make the whole grid one color. For example, if all other rows are also entirely white or entirely black, it might still be possible to make the entire grid one color by performing the operations.

2. **First and Last Columns Check**:
   - Similarly, the program checks if all squares in the first column are the same color and all squares in the last column are the same color, but these colors are different.
   - Again, this condition alone does not guarantee that it's impossible to make the entire grid one color.

The problem can be solved more effectively by checking if there is a single color that appears in every row and every column. If such a color exists, then it's possible to make the entire grid that color by performing the operations.

However, the given program does not perform this check. It only checks the first and last rows and columns. This means that there are cases where the program might output "NO" when it should output "YES".

For example, consider the following grid:
```
WB
BW
```
The program will output "NO" because the first and last rows are not the same color, and the first and last columns are not the same color. However, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color (either all white or all black) by performing the operations.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
