Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` filled with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each grid, it determines whether the grid meets specific conditions that would result in printing 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The conditions for printing 'NO' are that either the first and last rows are uniform in color but different from each other, or the first and last columns are uniform in color but different from each other.**
