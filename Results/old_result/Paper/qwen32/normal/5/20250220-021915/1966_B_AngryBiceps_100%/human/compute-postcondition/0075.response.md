Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a` concatenated together, `i` is `n-1`. The set of characters in `first_row` contains a single unique character, the set of characters in `last_row` contains a single unique character, and `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.**
