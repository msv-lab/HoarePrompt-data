The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about various variables and objects, but none of them influence the output of this particular `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Print Statement**: The print statement is `print('NO')`.
2. **Examine the Argument**: The argument to the `print` function is the string `'NO'`.
3. **Independence from Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` are described in the initial state, but they do not affect the output of the `print('NO')` statement.
4. **Output Determination**: Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, the output is straightforward and does not depend on any other part of the program.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
