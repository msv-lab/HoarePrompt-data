The only object in the loop head is the variable `val_a`, which iterates over the elements of `sec_arr`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state and how the loop progresses.

Given:
- `sec_arr` must have at least two tuples.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `val_a` was the second tuple in `sec_arr`.
- `sub_summ` is calculated as `val_a[0] + val_a[0]` where `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`.

Since `val_a` iterates over each tuple in `sec_arr`, at the start of the next iteration, `val_a` should be the next tuple in `sec_arr` after the second one. 

Let's assume `sec_arr` has at least three tuples for the loop to execute one more time. If `sec_arr` has more than two tuples, the next value of `val_a` will be the third tuple in `sec_arr`.

State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices (a_i, b_i) for Alice and Bob respectively for a particular item; `sec_arr` must have at least three tuples; `sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[0]` where `val_a` is the third tuple in `sec_arr`.**
