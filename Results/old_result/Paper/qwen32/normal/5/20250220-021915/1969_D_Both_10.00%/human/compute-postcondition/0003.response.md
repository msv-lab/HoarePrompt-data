The only object in the loop head is the variable `val_a`, which iterates over the elements of `sec_arr`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `val_a` to the next tuple in `sec_arr`.

Given that `sec_arr` must have at least one tuple and `val_a` is currently the first tuple (`val_a` is `sec_arr[0]`), for the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must have at least two tuples. In the next iteration, `val_a` will be the second tuple in `sec_arr`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices (a_i, b_i) for Alice and Bob respectively for a particular item; `sec_arr` must have at least two tuples; `sub_summ` is `val_a[0]`; `val_a` is the second tuple in `sec_arr`.**
