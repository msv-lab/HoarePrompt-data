Postcondition: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`. If the sum of the two integers in the current tuple `val_b` from `sec_arr` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is increased by the sum of the two integers in `val_b`.**
