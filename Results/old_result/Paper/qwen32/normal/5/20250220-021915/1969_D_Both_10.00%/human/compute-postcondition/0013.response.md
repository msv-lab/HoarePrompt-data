Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the first and second elements of `val_b`, and `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`.**

Explanation: The value of `sub_summ` has been updated to include the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b`. The other variables (`main_ar`, `sec_arr`, and `val_b`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions and states.
