Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices (a_i, b_i) for Alice and Bob respectively for a particular item; `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.
Code of the loop:
for val_b in main_ar:
    if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
        sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`. If the sum of the two integers in the current tuple `val_b` from `sec_arr` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is increased by the sum of the two integers in `val_b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, then `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the first and second elements of `val_b`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` remains the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`. `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `main_ar` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, `val_b` is the next tuple in `main_ar`. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is updated to its previous value plus `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
