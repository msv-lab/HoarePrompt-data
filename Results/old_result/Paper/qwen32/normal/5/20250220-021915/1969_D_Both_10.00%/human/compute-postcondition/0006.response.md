Initial State: `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices (a_i, b_i) for Alice and Bob respectively for a particular item; `sec_arr` must have at least three tuples; `sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[0]` where `val_a` is the third tuple in `sec_arr`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
sub_summ += val_a[0]
```

Since `sub_summ` is initially `val_a[0] + val_a[0]`, which simplifies to `2 * val_a[0]`, adding `val_a[0]` to `sub_summ` will result in `sub_summ` being `3 * val_a[0]`.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices (a_i, b_i) for Alice and Bob respectively for a particular item; `sec_arr` must have at least three tuples; `sub_summ` is `3 * val_a[0]`.**

In natural language: The output state is that `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged. The `sub_summ` variable, which initially held the value `2 * val_a[0]` (where `val_a` is the third tuple in `sec_arr`), is now updated to `3 * val_a[0]`.
