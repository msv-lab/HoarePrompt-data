Postcondition: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, where `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains 0. `test_cases` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer. `total_count` is 0. If `cnt` is less than 2, no additional changes are made to `results`, `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, or `total_count`.**
