The given Python code snippet increments the count of the element `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. Here's the breakdown:

- `test_cases` remains a list of test cases with at least 1 test case.
- `results` remains an empty list.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `num_list` remains a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers.
- `x` remains the second element in `num_list`.
- `num_of_lens` is updated such that the count of `x` is incremented by 1.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` has the count of `x` incremented by 1, `x` is the second element in `num_list`.**
