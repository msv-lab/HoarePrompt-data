The code snippet provided updates the value of `res` by adding the product of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to it. Other variables such as `results`, `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `total_count`, and `cnt` remain unchanged based on the given code.

Let's update `res` accordingly:
- If `res` was initially some value, say `X`, then after the operation, `res` becomes `X + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, where `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `res` is now `previous_res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer; `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`; `cnt` is `next_cnt`.**
