To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop and the information provided.

The loop iterates over each element `x` in `num_list`. For each element, it updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` to keep track of how many times each integer appears in `num_list`. After the loop completes, `total_count` will be the sum of all the counts in `num_of_lens`, which is essentially the total number of elements in `num_list`.

Given the initial state and the states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue to iterate over each element in `num_list` until all elements have been processed. 

Here's the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`, `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations, and `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain the count of each unique integer in `num_list`, and `total_count` will be equal to the length of `num_list`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged except for `test_cases` which is decremented by 1.
