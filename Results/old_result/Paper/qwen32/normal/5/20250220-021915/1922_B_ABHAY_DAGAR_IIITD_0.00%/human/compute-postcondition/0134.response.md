Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `test_cases` is an empty list.
- `results` is a list containing at least one computed `res` value.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `test_cases` is mentioned but is not used in the print statement.
- The variable `results` is mentioned and is known to contain at least one computed `res` value.
- However, the print statement is trying to print a variable named `result` (singular form), not `results` (plural form).

### Conclusion:
- Since the variable `result` is not defined in the initial state, it would raise a `NameError` if executed. However, based on the context, it seems like the intention might have been to print `results` instead of `result`.

Given the task constraints and the information provided, we can only describe the output based on the variable `result` as it is written in the print statement. Since `result` is not defined, the code would raise an error. But to adhere to the task format, we will describe it as follows:

Output: **NameError: name 'result' is not defined** (assuming the code is executed as written)
