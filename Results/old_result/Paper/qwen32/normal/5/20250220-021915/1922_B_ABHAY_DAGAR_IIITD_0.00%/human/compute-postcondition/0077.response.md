The code snippet increments `res` by the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Therefore, the new value of `res` is the old value of `res` plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt_current`, `cnt` is `cnt_next`, `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**
