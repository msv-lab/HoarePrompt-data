The only variable in the loop head is `x`, and it iterates over `num_list`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `x` and how it changes as the loop progresses.

Given:
- `num_list` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the second element in `num_list`.

To execute the next iteration, `x` should be the next element in `num_list` after the second element. Therefore, `x` should be the third element in `num_list` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, `x` is the third element in `num_list`**
