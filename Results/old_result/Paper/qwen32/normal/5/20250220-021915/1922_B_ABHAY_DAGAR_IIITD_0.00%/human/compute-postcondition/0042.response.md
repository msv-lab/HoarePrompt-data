To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the role of each variable and how they are updated within the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt
```

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the changes:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `res` is initialized to 0.
   - `total_count` is initialized to 0.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, the loop checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. If so, it updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
   - It then checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If so, it updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
   - Finally, it updates `total_count` by adding `cnt`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After all iterations, `res` will contain the sum of all combinations of integers from `num_list` taken 3 at a time (if the count of any integer is 3 or more) and all pairs of integers from `num_list` taken 2 at a time, weighted by the cumulative count of integers processed so far.
   - `total_count` will be the sum of all counts of integers in `num_of_lens`, i.e., the total number of integers in `num_list`.

**Output State**: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of all combinations of integers from `num_list` taken 3 at a time (if the count of any integer is 3 or more) and all pairs of integers from `num_list` taken 2 at a time, weighted by the cumulative count of integers processed so far, `total_count` is the total number of integers in `num_list`.**
