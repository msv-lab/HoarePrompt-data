The only variable in the loop head is `result`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If there are more elements in the `results` list, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list containing at least two computed `res` values, and `result` would have taken the value of the second last (or last, depending on the iteration) element in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element after the current `result`.

State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing at least three computed `res` values**
