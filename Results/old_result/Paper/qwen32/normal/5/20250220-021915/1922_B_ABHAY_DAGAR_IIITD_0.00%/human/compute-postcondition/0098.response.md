The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_list`. If there are more elements in `num_list` to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the last element processed from `num_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least one more element that hasn't been processed yet. The value of `x` should be set to the next element in `num_list`.

State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, `res` holds its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary. If `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with the value `1`, `x` is the next element in `num_list`**
