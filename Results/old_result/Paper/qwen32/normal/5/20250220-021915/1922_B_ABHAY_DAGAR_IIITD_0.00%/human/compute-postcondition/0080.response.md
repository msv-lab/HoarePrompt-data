The only object in the loop head is the variable `cnt`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If there are more values in `num_of_lens.values()`, the loop will execute again for the next value.

At the end of the last iteration, `cnt` held the value from the last iteration, and `num_of_lens.values()` still contains all the values that have not yet been iterated over. For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` should be updated to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Let's denote the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` as `next_cnt`.

State: **`test_cases` is `test_cases - 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is the input integer, `num_list` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its value is the count of that integer in `num_list`, `total_count` is `total_count + cnt`, `cnt` is `next_cnt`. If `next_cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is incremented by `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**

Since `next_cnt` is not explicitly defined in the provided state, we can denote it as the next value that `cnt` should take from `num_of_lens.values()`. However, for the purpose of this task, we'll keep it as `next_cnt`.
