The code snippet assigns `num_list` the value of a list created by mapping each split component of the input string to an integer. The other variables (`results`, `res`, `test_cases`, and `n`) remain unchanged in value or state.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it; `res` holds its original value; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input.**
