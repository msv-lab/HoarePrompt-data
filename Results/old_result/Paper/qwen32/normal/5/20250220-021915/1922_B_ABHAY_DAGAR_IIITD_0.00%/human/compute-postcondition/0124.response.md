The code snippet provided updates the `res` variable by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. The values of `results`, `next_cnt`, `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `total_count`, and `cnt` remain unchanged by this specific line of code.

To summarize the changes:
- `res` is updated to its previous value plus `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.

The other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it. If `next_cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) * (next_cnt - 2) // 6`. If `next_cnt` is 2, `res` is updated to the previous `res` plus `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. If `next_cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged. `test_cases` is decremented by 1. `n` is an input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the split input and contains at least one integer. `total_count` is `total_count + next_cnt`. `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. `res` is now `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.**
