The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of the key `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to 1. The other variables remain unchanged except for `num_of_lens`.

Output State: **`results` is a list with `res` appended to it, `res` holds its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with `x` as a key and its value set to 1, `x` is the second element in `num_list`.**
