Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary. If `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `x` is added to `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.**
