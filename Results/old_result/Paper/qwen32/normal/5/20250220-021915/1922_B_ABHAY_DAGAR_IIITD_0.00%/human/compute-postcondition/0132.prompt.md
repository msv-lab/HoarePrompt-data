Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) such that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    n = int(input())
    num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
    num_of_lens = {}
    for x in num_list:
        if x in num_of_lens:
            num_of_lens[x] += 1
        else:
            num_of_lens[x] = 1
    res = 0
    total_count = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
        if cnt >= 2:
            res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
        total_count += cnt
    results.append(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` remains a list of test cases with at least 1 test case; `results` is a list containing the value of `res`; `n` remains the input integer; `num_list` remains the list of integers obtained from the input; `num_of_lens` remains the dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`; `res` is updated to the final accumulated value after all iterations; `total_count` is updated to the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list with `res` appended to it; `res` holds its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list with the final `res` appended to it; `res` is the accumulated sum of all combinations calculated in the loop; `test_cases` is decremented by 1; `n` is unchanged; `num_list` is unchanged; `num_of_lens` is unchanged; `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
