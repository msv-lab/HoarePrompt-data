The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range defined by `97` and `k + 97`. The loop will execute if the range has at least one element, which means `k + 97` must be greater than `97`. Since `k` is guaranteed to be at least `1` according to the problem statement, the range will always have at least one element, and the loop will execute.

However, we need to ensure that `j` is correctly initialized to the starting value of the range, which is `97`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `j` is `97` (though `j` is not explicitly set before the loop in the provided state, it will be set to `97` at the start of the first iteration).

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the input such that 1 <= t <= 676; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26; `s` is an empty string, `j` is 97**
