Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `s` is the string of the first `k` letters of the alphabet.
- `k` is equal to 1.

From the initial state, we can deduce:
- Since `k` is 1, `s` will be the first letter of the alphabet, which is `"a"`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n * s)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement contains the expression `n * s`.
- `s` is known to be `"a"`.
- `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value from the given information. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

### Output Description:
- The expression `n * s` will repeat the string `s` `n` times.
- Since `s` is `"a"`, the output will be the string `"a"` repeated `n` times.

### Final Output:
Output: **"a" repeated n times (where n is an integer)**
