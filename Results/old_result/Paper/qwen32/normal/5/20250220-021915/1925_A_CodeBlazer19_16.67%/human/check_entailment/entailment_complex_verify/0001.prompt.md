You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 676, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)

            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: i is equal to t, n and k are the values from the last iteration, s is the string of the first k letters of the alphabet constructed in the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. It constructs a string `s` containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet and prints the string `n` times if `k` is 1, or prints the string twice if `n` is greater than 1 and once if `n` is 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The goal is to find the smallest possible string `s` that meets this requirement.

### Key Observations

1. **Subsequences**: For a string of length `n` to be a subsequence of `s`, it must appear in `s` in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively.
2. **Brute Force Approach**: One way to ensure all possible subsequences of length `n` are present is to construct `s` in such a way that all possible combinations of the first `k` letters are covered.
3. **Length of `s`**: The length of `s` must be at least `k^n`, but this can be minimized by overlapping combinations.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **String Construction**:
   - It initializes an empty string `s`.
   - It constructs `s` by appending characters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter of the alphabet.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `k == 1`, it prints `n` repetitions of the single character string `s`. This is correct because if `k == 1`, the only possible string of length `n` is `n` repetitions of the single character.
   - If `n == 1`, it prints `s` itself. This is also correct because if `n == 1`, all possible strings of length 1 are simply the characters from 'a' to the `k`-th letter.
   - For other cases, it prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`. This part of the code is incorrect because it does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are covered for `n > 1`.

### Correctness Evaluation

The program fails to generate the correct string `s` for cases where `n > 1` and `k > 1`. It does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. The logic `(2 - (n == 1)) * s` is not sufficient to cover all combinations.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
