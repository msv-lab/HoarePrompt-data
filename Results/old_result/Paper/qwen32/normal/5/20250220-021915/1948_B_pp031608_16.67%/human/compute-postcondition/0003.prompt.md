You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of lst is between 2 and 50 inclusive. This list represents the array a for a single test case. The function will be called multiple times, each time with a different list representing a different test case, and the number of such test cases is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns True if the original list `lst` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. The function returns `True` if the list `lst` is already sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns True if the original list `lst` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns False.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
