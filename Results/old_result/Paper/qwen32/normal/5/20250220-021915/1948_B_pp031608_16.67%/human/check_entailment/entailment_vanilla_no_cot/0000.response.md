Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether the array can be sorted using the described operations. Here are the key problems:

1. **Logical Flow and Conditions**:
   - The program attempts to perform the operation inside a loop that iterates over the array, but it does not correctly handle the transformation or check if the array is sorted after each operation.
   - The condition `if not func_1(list1):` is checked but the operations are not always correctly applied or in the correct order.

2. **Operation Implementation**:
   - The operation of splitting a number into its digits is not correctly implemented. The code `list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)` and `list1.insert(p, a % 10)` does not correctly split numbers like 12 into 1 and 2. For instance, `12 // 10` gives `1` and `12 % 10` gives `2`, but this logic is flawed for numbers greater than 19.
   - The operation should split the number into all its digits, not just the first and last.

3. **Loop and Index Management**:
   - The loop `for p in range(1, len(list1)):` does not correctly handle the insertion of multiple digits, which can change the length of the list and cause index errors.
   - The program does not re-check the entire list after each modification to see if it is sorted.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted, but it is not used effectively in the main logic.

To fix these issues, the program needs to:
- Correctly split numbers into their individual digits.
- Re-check the entire list after each modification.
- Ensure that the loop handles the dynamic changes in list length properly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    while True:
        modified = False
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] >= 10:
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(a[i])]
                a = a[:i] + digits + a[i+1:]
                modified = True
                break
        if not modified:
            break
    return a == sorted(a)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version defines a function `can_be_sorted` that repeatedly splits numbers into their digits until no more splits are possible, and then checks if the resulting list is sorted.
