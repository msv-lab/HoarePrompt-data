lst is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The first element of each inner list is the integer n, which indicates the number of elements in that test case. The length of each inner list is n + 1, with the first element being n.
