### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements. This part is correct.

2. **Logic for Sorting:**
   - The program iterates through the array using a for loop starting from the second element (index 1) and checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and if it is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it attempts to split the previous element into its digits and insert them back into the array.

3. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The program uses integer division and modulus operations to split the previous element into its digits. Specifically, it splits the number into two parts: `a // 10` (the tens place) and `a % 10` (the units place).
   - This logic is flawed because it only handles 2-digit numbers. It does not correctly handle numbers with more than 2 digits (e.g., 123 would be split into 12 and 3, which is incorrect).
   - Additionally, the logic to insert the digits back into the array is incorrect. The program should insert all digits of the split number, not just the first two.

4. **Checking Sortedness:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself. This part is correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted after attempting to split elements, otherwise it prints 'No'. This part is correct in terms of the output format, but the underlying logic is flawed.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle numbers with more than 2 digits.
- The logic to insert the digits back into the array is incorrect.

### Verification Using Annotations:
- The annotations describe the state of the program right before the function call, indicating that `lst` is a list of integers between 0 and 99, and its length is between 2 and 50.
- The `func_1` function correctly checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.
- However, the main logic in the loop does not correctly handle numbers with more than 2 digits and incorrectly inserts only the first two digits.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the logic for splitting numbers and inserting their digits back into the array, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all possible inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
