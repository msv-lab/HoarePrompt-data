Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits. Here's why:

1. The program incorrectly uses the `func_1` function to check if the list is sorted, but it does not correctly handle the splitting of elements. The splitting logic is flawed and does not consider the correct position to insert the digits.
2. The program only attempts to split the element at index `p-1` if it is greater than 10 and the list is not already sorted. However, this approach does not guarantee that the list will become sorted after the operation.
3. The program does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. It only attempts to split once per iteration of the loop.
4. The program does not correctly update the loop indices after splitting an element, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

**Input:**
```
1
5
12 3 45 67 89
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

In this example, the program should split the elements 12, 45, 67, and 89 into their individual digits, resulting in the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], which is sorted. However, the program does not perform the necessary splits and incorrectly outputs "NO".

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
