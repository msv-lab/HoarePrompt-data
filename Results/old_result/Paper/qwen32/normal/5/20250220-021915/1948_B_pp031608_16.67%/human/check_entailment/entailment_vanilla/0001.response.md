Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Logic for Sorting:**
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if the current array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - If the array is not sorted, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and if it is at least 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The program uses integer division and modulus operations to split the previous element into its digits.
   - However, this logic is flawed because it only handles 2-digit numbers and does not correctly handle numbers with more than 2 digits.
   - Additionally, the logic to insert the digits back into the array is incorrect. It should insert all digits of the split number, not just the first two.

4. **Checking Sortedness:**
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to check if the array is sorted after attempting to split elements.
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted after attempting to split elements, otherwise it prints 'No'.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle numbers with more than 2 digits.
- The logic to insert the digits back into the array is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for splitting numbers and inserting their digits back into the array, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all possible inputs.

Thus, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
