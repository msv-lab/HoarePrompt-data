### Reasoning:

Let's systematically analyze the provided Python program based on the problem description, the program code, and the function summary.

#### Input Parsing:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements. This part is correctly implemented.

#### Logic for Sorting:
- The program iterates through the array and checks if the current array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
- If the array is not sorted, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and if it is at least 10.
- If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

#### Splitting Logic:
- The logic to split a number and insert its digits back into the array is flawed. The current implementation only handles 2-digit numbers and does not correctly handle numbers with more than 2 digits.
- The program uses `a // 10` and `a % 10` to split a number into two digits, which is only valid for 2-digit numbers. For example, if the number is 123, the program will insert 12 and 3 into the array instead of 1, 2, and 3.
- Additionally, the logic to insert the digits back into the array is incorrect because it only handles the case where the number is split into two digits.

#### Checking Sortedness:
- The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of itself.

#### Output:
- The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted after attempting to split elements, otherwise it prints 'No'.

### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly handle numbers with more than 2 digits.
- The logic to insert the digits back into the array is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for splitting numbers and inserting their digits back into the array, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct result for all possible inputs.

Thus, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **False**
