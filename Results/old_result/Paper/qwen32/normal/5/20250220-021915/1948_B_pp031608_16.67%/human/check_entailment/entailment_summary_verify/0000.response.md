Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine whether the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself. It then iterates through the array, attempting to split elements greater than 10 if the array is not sorted. The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted.

### Function Summary:
- `func_1(lst)`: Returns `True` if `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, returns `False`.

### Program Logic:
1. **Loop through the array**: The loop iterates from the second element to the last.
2. **Check if the array is sorted**: If the array is not sorted (`not func_1(list1)`), and the current element or the previous element is greater than 10, the program attempts to split the previous element.
3. **Splitting logic**: The previous element is split into its tens and units digits, and these digits are inserted back into the array.
4. **Check again if the array is sorted**: After attempting a split, the program checks if the array is now sorted and prints "YES" or "NO" based on this check.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect splitting logic**: The program only attempts to split the element at `p-1` if the array is not sorted. However, it does not ensure that the correct element is split or that multiple elements need to be split.
2. **Loop index issues**: After splitting an element, the loop index `p` does not account for the new elements that have been inserted, which can lead to incorrect behavior.
3. **Single pass limitation**: The program only attempts to split once per iteration, which may not be sufficient to sort the array.
4. **Inefficient checking**: The program checks if the array is sorted multiple times unnecessarily.

### Example:
For the input:
```
1
5
12 3 45 67 89
```
The program should split `12`, `45`, `67`, and `89` into `1, 2`, `4, 5`, `6, 7`, and `8, 9` respectively, resulting in the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. However, the program does not perform these splits correctly and outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
