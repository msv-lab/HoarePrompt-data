The code snippet `n = int(input())` will update the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. This will overwrite the previous value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value provided by the user input, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'`, `i` is 1, `arr` is the string provided by the user input. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` contains the string `'yes'`. Otherwise, `results` contains the string `'no'`.**
