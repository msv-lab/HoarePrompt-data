Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D". For each test case, it checks if the number of "U" characters in the string is odd. If it is, the function outputs "yes"; otherwise, it outputs "no".**
