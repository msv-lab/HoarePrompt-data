To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and identify the value of the variable `i`.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to 0 (though `t` is not used in the `print(i)` statement, it is part of the precondition).
   - `n` is the integer value provided by the user input for the last test case.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters "U" and "D" for the last test case.
   - `results` is a non-empty list containing either the string `'yes'` or `'no'` for each test case depending on whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` is odd or even.
   - `arr` is the string provided by the user input for the last test case.

2. **The Variable `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state or in the code snippet.
   - Since `i` is not defined, it is likely that `i` is defined somewhere else in the code that is not provided in the snippet.
   - Without additional context or code, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, the variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state or the code snippet provided. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact value of `i` based on the given information.

### Output:
Since we cannot determine the value of `i`, the most precise description we can provide is that `i` is undefined in the given context.

Output: **i (where i is undefined in the given context)**
