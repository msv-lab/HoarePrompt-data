Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins. The second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the first integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables `n` and `s` are not yet assigned values because the code provided only reads the first line of input.
