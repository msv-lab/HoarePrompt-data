Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in each test case. According to the problem description, Alice wins if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and Bob wins if it is even. The code uses the `count` method to count the number of `'U'` characters in the string `arr` for each test case and checks if this count is odd or even. If the count is odd, it appends `'yes'` to the results list, indicating that Alice wins; otherwise, it appends `'no'`, indicating that Bob wins. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description and handles all potential cases as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
