The only variable in the loop head is `ch`, which iterates over each character in the string `password`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current character `ch` and how it relates to the remaining characters in `password`.

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
- `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `ch` is the current character being processed in the loop.
- `digits` and `letters` are lists that are modified based on whether `ch` is a digit or a letter.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ch` has been processed, and we need to move to the next character in `password` for the next iteration.

Let's denote the current character as `ch_current` and the next character as `ch_next`. Since `ch` is updated in each iteration to the next character in `password`, we need to adjust `ch` to `ch_next`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `ch` is `ch_current`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. If `ch_current` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the digit `ch_current` and `letters` is an empty list. Otherwise, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch_current` and `digits` is an empty list.

For the next iteration, `ch` will be the next character in `password` after `ch_current`. Let's denote this next character as `ch_next`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is `ch_next`. If `ch_next` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the digit `ch_next` and `letters` is an empty list. Otherwise, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch_next` and `digits` is an empty list.**

However, since the state of `digits` and `letters` is not directly related to the loop head and only `ch` is adjustable, we focus on `ch`:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is `ch_next`.**
