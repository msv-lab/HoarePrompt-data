Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` in the order they appear.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `letters` list will contain all the letters from the `password` string in the order they were encountered, and the `digits` list will contain all the digits from the `password` string in the order they were encountered. The values of `n` and `password` remain unchanged.
