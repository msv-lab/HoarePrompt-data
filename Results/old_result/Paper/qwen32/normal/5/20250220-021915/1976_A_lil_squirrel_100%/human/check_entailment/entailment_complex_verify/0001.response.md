### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly evaluates the program's behavior and reasoning based on the problem description and the annotated code. Here's a systematic breakdown:

1. **Separation of Letters and Digits**:
   - The program correctly separates the characters into `letters` and `digits` lists.
   - This is validated by the annotation that states `letters` contains all lowercase Latin letters from `password` in the order they appear, and `digits` contains all digits from `password` in the order they appear.

2. **Sorting Check**:
   - The program checks whether the `letters` list and `digits` list are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This is validated by the annotation that states if `letters` or `digits` lists are not sorted, the program returns 'NO'.

3. **Digit Placement Check**:
   - The program iterates through the password and ensures that no digit follows a letter.
   - This is validated by the annotation that states the loop checks for each character in the password if a letter is followed by a digit, and if so, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Output**:
   - The program returns 'YES' only if all checks pass.
   - This is validated by the annotation that states if the loop completes all iterations without returning 'NO', the program returns 'YES'.

### Example Walkthrough:
The original assessment provides a detailed walkthrough of the example inputs, and each step aligns with the program's behavior as described in the annotations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the checks required by the problem statement and produces the correct output for the provided examples. The annotations support the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the given problem description and the provided annotations.
