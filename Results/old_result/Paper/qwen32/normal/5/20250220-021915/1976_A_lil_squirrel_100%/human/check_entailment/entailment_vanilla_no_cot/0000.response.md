Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks if a password meets the specified conditions for being strong:

1. **Letters and digits only**: The program implicitly assumes this condition is already met, as per the problem statement.
2. **No digit after a letter**: The loop checks each character in the password to ensure that no digit follows a letter.
3. **Digits sorted in non-decreasing order**: The program compares the list of digits to its sorted version.
4. **Letters sorted in non-decreasing order**: Similarly, the program compares the list of letters to its sorted version.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs "YES" or "NO" based on whether each password satisfies the conditions.
