Reasoning:
The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether a given password meets the specified criteria for being strong. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works and why it's correct:

1. **Separation of Letters and Digits**: The function iterates through each character in the password and separates them into two lists: `letters` for alphabetic characters and `digits` for numeric characters.

2. **Sorting Check**: It checks if the list of letters is sorted in non-decreasing order using `letters != sorted(letters)`. If the list is not sorted, it immediately returns 'NO'. Similarly, it checks if the list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order using `digits != sorted(digits)`. If the list is not sorted, it also returns 'NO'.

3. **Order of Letters and Digits**: The function then iterates through the password to ensure that no letter is immediately followed by a digit. This is done with the loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(password) - 1):
       if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
           return 'NO'
   ```
   If any letter is followed by a digit, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Return 'YES'**: If none of the above conditions cause the function to return 'NO', it means the password meets all the criteria, and the function returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all the cases as per the problem statement, including cases where the password consists only of letters or only of digits.

Correctness: **True**
