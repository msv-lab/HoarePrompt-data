The code appends the character `ch` to the `letters` list. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an integer between 1 and 20, and `password` remains a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The character `ch` is specified to be the next character in the `password` string after `ch_next`, and it will be added to the `letters` list as its new last element since it is not a digit.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the next character in the `password` string after `ch_next`, and `letters` has `ch` as its new last element.**
