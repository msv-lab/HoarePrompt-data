You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` checks if a given password, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, meets specific criteria: all letters must be in non-decreasing order, all digits must be in non-decreasing order, and no letter should be immediately followed by a digit. It returns 'YES' if the password meets all these criteria, otherwise it returns 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the condition where the password consists only of digits or only of letters. Specifically, the code checks if the letters and digits are sorted individually and if there is no digit after a letter, but it does not ensure that all letters come before any digits. This means that a password like "a2b3" would incorrectly be considered valid.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
a2b3
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output from the Program:
```
YES
```

In this case, the letter 'b' is followed by the digit '3', which violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter. The code does not catch this scenario because it only checks for the order within the groups of letters and digits separately, not the overall order between them.

To fix this, the code should ensure that all letters come before any digits in the password. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if len(letters) + len(digits) != n:
        return 'NO'
    if len(letters) > 0 and len(digits) > 0 and password.index(digits[0]) < password.rindex(letters[-1]):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This version ensures that all letters come before any digits by checking the position of the first digit and the last letter in the password.
