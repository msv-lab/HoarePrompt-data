The code snippet creates a new list `x` by taking the first element of each sublist in the 2D list `a`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a 2D list with 4 sublists, `x` will be a list containing the first element of each of these 4 sublists.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input, where 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 sublists, each sublist contains integers from a line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`.**
