The code reads 4 lines of input, each containing space-separated integers, and converts them into a 2D list `a` where each sublist corresponds to one line of input. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not used in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input, where 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 sublists, each sublist contains integers from a line of input.**
