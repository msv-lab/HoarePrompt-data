Output State: **`t` is the integer input, where 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 sublists, each sublist contains integers from a line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.**

In natural language: The value of `dx` is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`, which consists of the first elements of each of the 4 sublists in the 2D list `a`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
