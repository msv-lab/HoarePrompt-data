You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1 2
    
    4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 2
    
    -1 1
    
    1 -1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 -1
    
    45 11
    
    45 39
    
    17 11
    
    17 39

Output

    9
    4
    784

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        print(dx * dx)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It then calculates and prints the area of each square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program calculates the area of a square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and then squaring that difference. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the side length of the square, which could be determined by either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates, depending on the orientation of the square.

### Potential Case Where the Program Does Not Work:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
The correct area of the square is 4 (side length of 2). However, the program will output 0 because the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is 2, and the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates is also 2, but the program only considers the x-coordinates and incorrectly calculates the area as \(2 - 0 = 2\) and then squares it to get 4, which is correct in this case but not due to the logic used. 

However, a more illustrative case would be:
```
1
0 0
0 3
3 0
3 3
```
The correct area of the square is 9 (side length of 3). The program will output 9 because the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is 3, and it squares it to get 9. But this is not a general solution. If the input is:
```
1
0 0
0 3
2 0
2 3
```
The correct area of the square is still 9 (side length of 3), but the program will output 4 because the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is 2, and it squares it to get 4, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the side length of the square in all cases. The side length should be determined by the maximum difference between any pair of x-coordinates or y-coordinates, whichever is larger.
