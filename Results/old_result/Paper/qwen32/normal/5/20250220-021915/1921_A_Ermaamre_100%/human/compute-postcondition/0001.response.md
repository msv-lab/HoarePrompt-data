In the given task, the for loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The loop head only contains the variable `_` and the range `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the execution of the loop, the only variable we need to adjust is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Given that the initial state specifies `1 <= t <= 100`, this condition is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes.

However, the task specifies that we should adhere to the format of providing the state, so we will confirm that `t` is within the given range and does not need further adjustment.

State: **`t` is the integer input, where 1 <= `t` <= 100**
