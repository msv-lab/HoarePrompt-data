The code snippet provided only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` represents the number of test cases. The values of the coordinates for the corners of the squares are not yet processed by this code snippet.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, after executing the code snippet, `t` will be assigned the value of the integer input. The precondition that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100 remains valid.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input, where 1 <= `t` <= 100.**
