Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns a list containing the side length of each square for the given test cases.**
