The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` would have been incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `_` to be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable (commonly used when the loop variable is not used inside the loop), we don't need to consider its value in the state description beyond ensuring that the loop can continue to execute. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it dictates the total number of iterations.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` should remain the same.

State: **`t` is the integer input, where 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` is a 2D list containing 4 sublists, each sublist contains integers from a line of input; `x` is a list containing the first element of each of the 4 sublists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`; `_` is incremented by 1**.

Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to specify its exact value in the state description, but we know it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. The other variables remain unchanged.
