In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `_` and the function `input()`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. Therefore, the only thing we need to adjust is the value of `t` to ensure the loop executes.

Given that `t` is already defined as the number of test cases and is provided as input, the state before the loop should ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

So, the state before the loop starts should be such that `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
