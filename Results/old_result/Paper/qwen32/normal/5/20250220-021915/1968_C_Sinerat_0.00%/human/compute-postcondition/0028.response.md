The code provided updates the list `x` with the integer values from the input. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged based on the given initial state. Since the input is not specified, we will denote the new values in `x` as the integers provided by the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the integer value of the input; `x` is a list of integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and each subsequent element at index `i` (for 1 ≤ i < n) is the sum of 500 and all elements in `x` up to index `i-1`.**
