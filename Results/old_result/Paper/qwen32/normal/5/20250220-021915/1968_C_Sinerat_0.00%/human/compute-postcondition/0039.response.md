Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is the number of elements in the array `a`, and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers. The array `a` is constructed such that `a[0]` is 500, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. After all iterations, the final output will be the printed arrays `a` for each test case.**

In simpler terms, the loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, an array `a` of size `n` is created. The first element of `a` is set to 500, and each subsequent element is calculated as the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`. This process is repeated for all test cases, and for each test case, the final array `a` is printed.
