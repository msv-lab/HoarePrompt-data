You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it constructs and prints an array `a` of length `n` where the first element is 500 and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in the input list `x`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to construct an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
2. \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Here, \( x_i \) is given for \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution initializes the first element of the array \( a \) to 500 and then iteratively computes the subsequent elements using the formula \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).

Let's verify if this approach satisfies the conditions:
1. **Initial Condition:**
   - The first element \( a[0] \) is set to 500, which is within the valid range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).

2. **Recursive Condition:**
   - For \( i \ge 1 \), the element \( a[i] \) is calculated as \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).
   - Since \( x[i-1] \) is given to be in the range \( 1 \le x[i-1] \le 500 \) and \( a[i-1] \) is at least 500, the sum \( a[i] \) will always be greater than 500 and less than or equal to \( 10^9 + 500 \), which is still within the valid range.

3. **Modulo Condition:**
   - We need to check if \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) holds.
   - By the definition of the modulo operation, \( a[i] \bmod a[i-1] \) is the remainder when \( a[i] \) is divided by \( a[i-1] \).
   - Given \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \), the remainder of \( a[i] \) when divided by \( a[i-1] \) is simply \( x[i-1] \) because \( a[i-1] \) divides into \( a[i] \) exactly once with a remainder of \( x[i-1] \).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution satisfies all the conditions of the problem:
- It ensures that all elements of \( a \) are within the valid range.
- It constructs the array such that the modulo condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) holds for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Therefore, the program is correct.
