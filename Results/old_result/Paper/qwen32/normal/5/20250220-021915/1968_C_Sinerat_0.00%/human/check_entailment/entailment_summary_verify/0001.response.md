Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to construct an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
2. \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Here, \( x_i \) is given for \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution initializes the first element of the array \( a \) to 500 and then iteratively computes the subsequent elements using the formula \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).

Let's verify if this approach satisfies the conditions:
1. **Initial Condition:**
   - The first element \( a[0] \) is set to 500, which is within the valid range \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \).

2. **Recursive Condition:**
   - For \( i \ge 1 \), the element \( a[i] \) is calculated as \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).
   - Since \( x[i-1] \) is given to be in the range \( 1 \le x[i-1] \le 500 \) and \( a[i-1] \) is at least 500, the sum \( a[i] \) will always be greater than 500 and less than or equal to \( 10^9 + 500 \), which is still within the valid range.

3. **Modulo Condition:**
   - We need to check if \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) holds.
   - By the definition of the modulo operation, \( a[i] \bmod a[i-1] \) is the remainder when \( a[i] \) is divided by \( a[i-1] \).
   - Given \( a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1] \), the remainder of \( a[i] \) when divided by \( a[i-1] \) is simply \( x[i-1] \) because \( a[i-1] \) divides into \( a[i] \) exactly once with a remainder of \( x[i-1] \).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution satisfies all the conditions of the problem:
- It ensures that all elements of \( a \) are within the valid range.
- It constructs the array such that the modulo condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) holds for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly constructs the array \( a \) that satisfies the given conditions.
