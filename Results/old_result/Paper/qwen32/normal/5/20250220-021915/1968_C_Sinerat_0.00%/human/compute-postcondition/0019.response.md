The provided code snippet updates the `i`-th element of the list `a` by adding the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` to the `(i-1)`-th element of `x`. Given the initial state, the list `a` starts with a first element set to 500 and the rest are zeros. The list `x` is a list of integers.

Let's analyze the impact of the code:

- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
- Since the initial state specifies that `a` has its first element set to 500 (`a[0] = 500`), and the rest are zeros, the first update will be `a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 500 + x[0]`.
- The rest of the elements in `a` remain unchanged unless further iterations of this code are executed.

Given the initial state and the single line of code, the output state will be:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `x` remains the same list of integers.
- `a` has its first element as 500 and its second element updated to `500 + x[0]`, with all other elements still being 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `x` is a new list of integers; `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element set to 500 and the second element set to `500 + x[0]`.**
