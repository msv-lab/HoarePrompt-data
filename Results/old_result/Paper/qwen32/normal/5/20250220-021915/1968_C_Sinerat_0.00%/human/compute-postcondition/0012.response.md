To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the structure of the list `a` based on the given initial state.

1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` is not directly used in the calculation of the list `a`, so we can ignore it for this specific print statement.
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1. This variable determines the length of the list `a`.
3. `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer.
4. `a` is a list of `n` integers where:
   - The first element is 500.
   - The second element is \(500 + x[0]\).
   - The third element is \(500 + x[0] + x[1]\).
   - The i-th element (for \(i > 0\)) is the sum of the (i-1)-th element of `a` and the (i-1)-th element of `x`.

Given this information, the list `a` is constructed as follows:
- \(a[0] = 500\)
- \(a[1] = 500 + x[0]\)
- \(a[2] = 500 + x[0] + x[1]\)
- \(a[3] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]\)
- ...
- \(a[i] = 500 + \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} x[j]\) for \(i > 0\)

The `print(*a)` statement will print all elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Let's summarize the output in a precise format:

Output: **500, 500 + x[0], 500 + x[0] + x[1], 500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2], ..., 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]** (where each element in the list `a` is calculated as described above based on the values in the list `x` and the length `n`)
