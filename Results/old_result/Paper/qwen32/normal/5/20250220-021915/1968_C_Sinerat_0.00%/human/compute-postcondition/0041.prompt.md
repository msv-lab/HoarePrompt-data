You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array a. The second line contains n-1 integers x_2, x_3, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array x. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 500
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is the number of elements in the array `a`, and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers. The array `a` is constructed such that `a[0]` is 500, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[i-1]` and `x[i-1]`. After all iterations, the final output will be the printed arrays `a` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` representing the number of elements in an array `a`, and `n-1` integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` representing the elements of the array `x`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the provided elements, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
