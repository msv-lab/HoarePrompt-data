The code snippet `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the `i`-th element of the list `a` to be the sum of the `(i-1)`-th element of `a` and the `(i-1)`-th element of `x`. Given that `a` initially has its first element set to 500 and the rest to 0, and `x` is a list of integers, the update will propagate the sum of the elements of `x` through `a`.

Here's the detailed breakdown:
- `a[0]` remains 500.
- `a[1]` becomes `a[0] + x[0]` which is `500 + x[0]`.
- `a[2]` becomes `a[1] + x[1]` which is `(500 + x[0]) + x[1]`.
- This pattern continues up to `a[n-1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers provided by the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500, `a[1]` is `500 + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, ..., `a[i]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[i-1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`.**
