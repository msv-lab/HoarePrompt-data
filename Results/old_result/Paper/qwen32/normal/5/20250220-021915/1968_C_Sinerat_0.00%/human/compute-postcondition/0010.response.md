The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state, `a[i]` initially holds the value `500 + x[0] + x[1]`. After the execution of the code, `a[i]` is updated to `a[2] + x[2]`, which is `(500 + x[0] + x[1]) + x[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer greater than 3; `x` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each split element to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, the second element is `500 + x[0]`, the third element is `500 + x[0] + x[1]`, and the fourth element is `500 + x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`; `i` is 3**.
