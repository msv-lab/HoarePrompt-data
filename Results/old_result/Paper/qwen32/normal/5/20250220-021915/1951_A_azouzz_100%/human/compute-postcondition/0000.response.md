The code snippet `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. This action does not affect the function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` or its parameters `start` and `end`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the variable `t` with the value provided by the user.

Output State: **The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` takes two integer arguments, `start` and `end`, such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`; `t` is an input integer.**
