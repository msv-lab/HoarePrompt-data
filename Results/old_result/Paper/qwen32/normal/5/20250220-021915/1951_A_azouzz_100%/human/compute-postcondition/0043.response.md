The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement prints the string `'NO'` directly. The value `'NO'` is explicitly given in the code and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`).

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
