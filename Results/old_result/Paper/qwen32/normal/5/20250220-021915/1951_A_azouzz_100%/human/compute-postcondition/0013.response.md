Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `cnt1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.
- `cnt1` is explicitly stated to be equal to 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

Given the code snippet, the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. None of the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1` are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
