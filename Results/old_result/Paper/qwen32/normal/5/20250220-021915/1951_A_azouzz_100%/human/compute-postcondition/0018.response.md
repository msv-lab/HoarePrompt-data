The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides several conditions and variable definitions, but none of these conditions or variables affect the execution of the `print('YES')` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `cnt1`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('YES')` statement is a straightforward print command that outputs the string `'YES'`.
2. The initial state provides conditions and variable definitions, but none of these influence what is printed by the `print('YES')` statement.
3. Since the `print` statement does not rely on any of the variables or their values, the output will be exactly the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
