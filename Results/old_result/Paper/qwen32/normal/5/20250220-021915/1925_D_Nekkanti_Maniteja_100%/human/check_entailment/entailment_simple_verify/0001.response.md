### Reasoning:

Let's carefully re-evaluate the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs during `k` excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 each time they are chosen.
- The expected value should be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) and we need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

#### Program Analysis:
The program follows these steps:
1. Reads `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case.
2. Computes `c`, the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), modulo \(10^9+7\).
3. Initializes `s` (sum of expected friendship values) and `a` (sum of initial friendship values of all friend pairs).
4. Reads the `m` friend pairs and their friendship values, adding the friendship values to `a`.
5. Iterates `k` times, updating `s` with the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
6. Prints `s % M`.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program's formula for updating `s` is incorrect. Let's break down why this is the case and what the correct approach should be.

1. **Incorrect Formula**:
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the expected increase in friendship values.
   - The expected contribution of a friend pair with initial friendship value `f` over `k` excursions is not simply `c * i * c * m + c * a`. Instead, it should account for the fact that the probability of a specific pair being chosen in any given excursion is `c`.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions involves calculating the probability of each pair being chosen and summing up their contributions.
   - The correct approach is to calculate the expected number of times each pair is chosen, which is `k * c`. The expected contribution of a pair with initial friendship value `f` is the sum of an arithmetic series: \(f + (f+1) + (f+2) + \ldots + (f+(k-1))\).

3. **Summation of Contributions**:
   - The expected contribution of a pair with initial friendship value `f` is given by the sum of the arithmetic series: \(\sum_{j=0}^{k-1} (f+j) = k \cdot f + \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} j = k \cdot f + \frac{k(k-1)}{2}\).
   - Since the probability of a specific pair being chosen in any given excursion is `c`, the expected contribution of all pairs is the sum of the expected contributions of each pair, weighted by `c`.

#### Correct Approach:
The correct approach involves:
- Calculating the expected contribution of each friend pair over the `k` excursions.
- Summing up these contributions to get the total expected sum of friendship values.
- Calculating the final result as a fraction and finding its modular inverse.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the program's incorrectness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
