The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `a`. This affects the variable `a` while other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `M` is \(10^9 + 7\), `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), `a` is 0, `i` is \(m + k\)**.
