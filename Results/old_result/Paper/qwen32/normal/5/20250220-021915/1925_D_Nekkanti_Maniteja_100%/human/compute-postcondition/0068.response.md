The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m + k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. However, since `i` is initialized to `m + k + 1`, it is already greater than `k`, and the loop should not execute again based on the current value of `i`.

To adjust the state so that the loop can execute one more time, we need to set `i` to a value less than `k`. Since the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we should set `i` to the value it would have at the start of the next iteration if it were to execute. This means setting `i` to the value it had at the start of the current iteration, which is `m + k`.

State: **`s` is `s + c * (m + k + 1) * c * m + c * a`; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `k` must be greater than 0; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo 1000000007; `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the `m` iterations; `i` is `m + k`**
