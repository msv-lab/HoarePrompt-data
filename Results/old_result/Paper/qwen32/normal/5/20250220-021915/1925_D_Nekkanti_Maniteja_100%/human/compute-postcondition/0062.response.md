The code snippet `a += f` increases the value of `a` by `f`. Given the initial state, `a` is already increased by `2 * f` before the code snippet, so the new value of `a` will be the previous value of `a` plus `f`, which is equivalent to `a` being increased by `3 * f`.

The other variables `m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged. The condition `m` must be greater than `i + 1` is still valid, and `i` has been incremented by 1 as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than `i + 1`; `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers read from the input; `a` is increased by `3 * f`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
