Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. Each of the next m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i where a_i != b_i, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9. All pairs (a_i, b_i) are distinct. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: s = (c * a * k + (c * c * m * k * (k - 1) // 2)) % M

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: s is \(\frac{c^2 \cdot m \cdot (2m + k - 3) \cdot k}{2} + k \cdot c \cdot a\), n is the first integer from the input, m is the second integer from the input, k is the third integer from the input, M is 10, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo 10, a is the sum of all f values from the input, i is \(m + k - 1\)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: s is s + (c^2 * m * k * (2m + k + 1)) // 2 + c * a * k, n is the first integer from the input, m is the second integer from the input, k is the third integer from the input, M is 1000000007, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 modulo 1000000007, a is the sum of all f values read from the input during the m iterations, i is m + k.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
