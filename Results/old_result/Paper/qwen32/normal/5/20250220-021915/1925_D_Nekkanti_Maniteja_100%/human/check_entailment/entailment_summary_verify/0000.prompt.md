You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of nodes, edges, and an additional parameter, respectively. For each test case, it also processes `m` lines of input, each containing three integers representing an edge between nodes and a weight. The function calculates and prints a specific value for each test case based on these inputs, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Here are the issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in their friendship value over k excursions.
   - The code incorrectly uses `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` which is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs. This should be used to calculate the probability of selecting a friend pair, but the subsequent calculations are incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Iteration and Summation**:
   - The code iterates `k` times and updates the sum `s` in a manner that does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation. The summation logic is flawed, and it does not account for the correct probabilities and expected friendship value increases.

3. **Ignoring the Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The code correctly sums the initial friendship values, but it does not correctly account for the expected increases in these values over the k excursions.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The code does not handle the case where there are no friend pairs correctly. While it outputs `0` for the first test case, this is coincidental and does not reflect the correct logic.

Here is a brief outline of how the correct logic should be implemented:

- Calculate the probability of selecting a friend pair: `p_friend = m / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
- Calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each friend pair over k excursions.
- Sum the initial friendship values and add the expected increases.
- Calculate the final expected value and convert it to the required modular form.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the problem description, and therefore, it is incorrect.
