To determine what will be printed by the `print(s % M)` statement, we need to break down the expression and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Given Information:
- **s** is calculated using the formula: `s = s + (c^2 * m * k * (2m + k + 1)) // 2 + c * a * k`
- **n** is the first integer from the input.
- **m** is the second integer from the input.
- **k** is the third integer from the input.
- **M** is a constant, `1000000007`.
- **c** is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`.
- **a** is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the `m` iterations.
- **i** is `m + k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse (c):**
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`. This means that `c` is a number such that `(n * (n - 1) // 2) * c % 1000000007 = 1`.
   - The exact value of `c` depends on the value of `n`.

2. **Sum of `f` values (a):**
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input during the `m` iterations. The exact value of `a` depends on the input values of `f`.

3. **Calculation of `s`:**
   - `s` is updated using the formula: `s = s + (c^2 * m * k * (2m + k + 1)) // 2 + c * a * k`.
   - The exact value of `s` depends on the initial value of `s`, the values of `c`, `m`, `k`, and `a`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(s % M)` statement will print the value of `s` modulo `1000000007`.

### Final Output Description:
- The output will be the value of `s` after the given calculation, taken modulo `1000000007`.
- Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the `f` values are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `s % M`.

Output: **s % M (where s is calculated as described and M is 1000000007)**
