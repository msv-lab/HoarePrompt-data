Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program and determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen during `k` excursions. The expected value should be expressed as a fraction `p/q` and the result should be `p * q^-1 % (10^9 + 7)`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k` are read.
   - For each pair of friends, their indices and initial friendship value are read.

2. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` is the modulus for the final result.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs. This is used to determine the probability of selecting a specific pair.
   - `s` is initialized to 0 and will store the sum of expected friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0 and will store the sum of initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

3. **Processing Each Pair of Friends:**
   - For each pair of friends `(u, v, f)`, the initial friendship value `f` is added to `a`.

4. **Calculating the Expected Sum for `k` Excursions:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` is intended to calculate the expected sum of friendship values for each excursion.
   - However, the calculation inside the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` seems incorrect and does not properly account for the increase in friendship values over time.

### Issues in the Program:
- The formula inside the loop for updating `s` is incorrect. It seems to be trying to calculate something involving the sum of an arithmetic series, but it does not correctly model the expected increase in friendship values.
- The expected value calculation should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair and the increase in their friendship value over time, which involves a more complex summation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the formula for updating `s` inside the loop, the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

**Correctness: False**
