Let's analyze the given program and determine if it correctly computes the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, as described in the problem statement.

### Key Points in the Problem Statement:
1. **Friendship Value Calculation:**
   - Initially, each pair of friends has a given friendship value.
   - Each time a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - The task is to calculate the expected sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers.
   - The final answer is \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

3. **Probability of Choosing a Pair:**
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of children is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program correctly calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`, which is the probability of selecting any given pair.

2. **Summation of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - It correctly sums up the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected sum of friendship values for k excursions. However, the logic used in the loop `for i in range(k)` seems to be incorrect.
   - The expected value for each excursion involves the probability of selecting a pair and the current friendship value of that pair. The given loop does not correctly account for the incremental increase in friendship values over k excursions.

### Correctness of the Program:
The given program does not correctly compute the expected sum of friendship values. The logic in the loop for calculating `s` is flawed. It does not correctly account for the incremental increase in friendship values and the probability of selecting each pair over k excursions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Calculate the expected increase in friendship values for each pair over k excursions.
- Sum these expected values, taking into account the initial friendship values and the probability of selecting each pair.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
