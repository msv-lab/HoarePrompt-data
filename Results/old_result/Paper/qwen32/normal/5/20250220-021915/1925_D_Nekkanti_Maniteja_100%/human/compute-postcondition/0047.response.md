To determine the output of the `print(s % M)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the formula for `s`.

### Given Initial State:
- `s` is calculated using the formula: 
  \[
  s = \frac{c^2 \cdot m \cdot (2m + k - 3) \cdot k}{2} + k \cdot c \cdot a
  \]
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `k` is the third integer from the input.
- `M` is 10.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo 10.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the input.
- `i` is \(m + k - 1\).

### Calculation of `c`:
The modular multiplicative inverse `c` of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo 10 is a value such that:
\[
c \cdot \left(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\right) \equiv 1 \pmod{10}
\]
This means `c` is the number that, when multiplied by \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\), gives a result that is congruent to 1 modulo 10.

### Calculation of `s`:
The formula for `s` involves several variables:
- \(c^2\)
- \(m\)
- \(k\)
- \(2m + k - 3\)
- \(a\)

### Final Output:
The `print(s % M)` statement will print the value of `s` modulo 10. Since we do not have specific values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Let's summarize the output:
- `s` is a complex expression involving `c`, `m`, `k`, and `a`.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo 10.
- `s % M` gives the remainder when `s` is divided by 10.

### Final Answer:
Output: **s % 10 (where s is calculated as \(\frac{c^2 \cdot m \cdot (2m + k - 3) \cdot k}{2} + k \cdot c \cdot a\) and c is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo 10)**
