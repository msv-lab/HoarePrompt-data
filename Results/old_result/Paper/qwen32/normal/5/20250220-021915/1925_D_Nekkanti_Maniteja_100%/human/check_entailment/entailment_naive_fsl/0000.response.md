Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Here are the issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The code incorrectly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in their friendship value over k excursions.
   - The code incorrectly uses `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` which is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs. This should be used to calculate the probability of selecting a friend pair, but the subsequent calculations are incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Iteration and Summation**:
   - The code iterates `k` times and updates the sum `s` in a manner that does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation. The summation logic is flawed, and it does not account for the correct probabilities and expected friendship value increases.

3. **Ignoring the Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The code correctly sums the initial friendship values, but it does not correctly account for the expected increases in these values over the k excursions.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The code does not handle the case where there are no friend pairs correctly. While it outputs `0` for the first test case, this is coincidental and does not reflect the correct logic.

Here is a brief outline of how the correct logic should be implemented:

- Calculate the probability of selecting a friend pair: `p_friend = m / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`.
- Calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each friend pair over k excursions.
- Sum the initial friendship values and add the expected increases.
- Calculate the final expected value and convert it to the required modular form.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the problem description, and therefore, it is incorrect.
