The code snippet provided initializes a variable `s` to 0. No other variables are modified in the given snippet. Therefore, the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `s` is 0.**
