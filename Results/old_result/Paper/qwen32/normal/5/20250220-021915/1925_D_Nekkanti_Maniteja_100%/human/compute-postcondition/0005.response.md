The code snippet provided initializes a new variable `a` to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, and `s`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is 0.**
