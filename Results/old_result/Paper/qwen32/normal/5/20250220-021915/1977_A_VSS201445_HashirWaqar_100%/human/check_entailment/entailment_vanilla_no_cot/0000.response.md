Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

The problem states that Nikita can either add one cube or remove one cube from the tower in each move. We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

The key observation here is:
- If `m > n`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes because the maximum number of cubes we can add is `n`.
- If `m <= n`, we need to check if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because each move either adds one cube or removes one cube, so the net change in the number of cubes after `n` moves must be even to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

The given program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
- If both conditions are true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
