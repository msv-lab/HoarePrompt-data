The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means the initial state's description of `t`, `n`, and `m` needs to be updated based on the new values of `n` and `m` provided by the input. The condition based on `n` and `m` remains unchanged but now refers to the newly input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100; `n` and `m` are integers provided by the input. If the newly input `n` is greater than or equal to the newly input `m` and the difference between the newly input `n` and `m` is even, the conditions specified in the if part hold. Otherwise, either the newly input `n` is less than the newly input `m`, or the difference between the newly input `n` and `m` is not even, as specified in the else part.**
