The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the value of `i` is not specified, we can only state that `idx1` and `idx2` now have the same value as `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no further changes are made to `i`. `idx1` is `i`; `idx2` is `i`.**
