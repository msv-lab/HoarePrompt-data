The code snippet `idx1 = idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. This means that after executing this code, both `idx1` and `idx2` will have the same value as `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that n >= 2; `m` is an integer; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the new input line; `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `l11` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a2` from `l1`; `l22` is a list created by removing all occurrences of `a1` from `l2`; `idx1` is `i`; `idx2` is `i`; `p1` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1]` was equal to `a2`, otherwise `p1` is 0; `p2` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1]` was not equal to `a2`, otherwise `p2` is 0. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of and `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the loop continues without breaking out.**
