The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of participants and a number of screenshots. For each test case, it checks if the order of participants seen by the author of the screenshot is consistent across all screenshots, considering the possibility of swapping the author with another participant in one of the screenshots. It outputs "yes" if the order is consistent and "no" otherwise.
