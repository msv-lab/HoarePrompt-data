The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'no'`. The initial state provides several variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) but these are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the value of these variables does not affect the output.

Let's break down the information given:

- `t` is set to 1.
- `n` and `m` are integers provided as input.
- `a1` is the first integer from the first input line.
- `l1` is a list of integers from the first input line, excluding `a1`.
- `a2` is the first integer from the second input line.
- `l2` is a list of integers from the second input line, excluding `a2`.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`.

However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string `'no'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **no**
