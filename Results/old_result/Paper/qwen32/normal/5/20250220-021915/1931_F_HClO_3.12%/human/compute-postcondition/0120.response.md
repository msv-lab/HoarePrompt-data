To determine what will be printed by the `print('no')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the logic leading up to the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer input such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` are integers where `m` must be at least 3.
- `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input.
- `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input.
- `l1` is modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`.
- `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively.
- `idx1` and `idx2` are indices that are recalculated based on certain conditions.
- `p1` and `p2` are flags indicating whether `a2` or `a1` was found in `l1` or `l2` respectively.
- `val` is a list containing at least one more tuple.
- `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`.
- There is a condition that checks if `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing all occurrences of `a3` from `l`. If this condition is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Analysis:
The print statement `print('no')` is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions that change its output. The string `'no'` is hardcoded and will be printed regardless of the values of the other variables or the results of any previous computations.

### Conclusion:
The `print('no')` statement will output the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
