The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in this context, there is no loop, so the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, none of the variables `t`, `n`, or `m` are changed.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer. The current value of `m` is 1.**
