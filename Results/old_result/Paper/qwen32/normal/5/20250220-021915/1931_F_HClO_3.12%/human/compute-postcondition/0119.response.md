To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `a3` and `l3`. According to the provided description, `a3` and `l3` are taken from the list of tuples `val`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `a3` and `l3`.
2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a3` is `a3_next` and `l3` is `l3_next`.
3. **Determine the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `val` must contain at least one more tuple. The next tuple in `val` will provide the new values for `a3` and `l3`.

Given that `val` contains at least one more tuple, we can assume that `val` has the form `[(a3_1, l3_1), (a3_2, l3_2), ..., (a3_last, l3_last)]`, and we have just finished processing `(a3_next, l3_next)`, which is `(a3_i, l3_i)` for some `i`. The next tuple to be processed will be `(a3_{i+1}, l3_{i+1})`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `a3` will be `a3_{i+1}` and `l3` will be `l3_{i+1}`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input, with `m` must be at least 3; `a1` and `a2` are integers from the input lines; `l1` and `l2` are lists from the input lines, with `l1` modified by inserting `a1` at `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`; `l11` and `l22` are lists created by removing occurrences of `a2` from `l1` and `a1` from `l2` respectively; `idx1` is the original `idx1` value plus 1 if `idx1 > idx2`, otherwise it is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `idx2` is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or -1 if no such index is found; `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 if `a2` or `a1` was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0; `val` is a list containing at least one more tuple; `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`; `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing all occurrences of `a3` from `l`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the control flow.**
