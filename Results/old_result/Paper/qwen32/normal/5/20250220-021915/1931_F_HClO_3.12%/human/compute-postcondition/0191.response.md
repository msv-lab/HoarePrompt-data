Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `i` is 3. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 3 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is 3 and `p2` is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `p1`, `idx2`, and `p2` remain unchanged. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
