The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `m`. The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `m` must be at least 3.

Given the conditions:
- `n` is at least 4 (this does not affect the loop directly but is part of the state).
- `m` remains at least 5 unless `m` was equal to 2, in which case `m` remains 1 and the loop continues to the next iteration. However, for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 3.
- All other variables (`t`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial values and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` remains adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 4; `m` is at least 3; `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22` remain unchanged from their initial values; `i` is `n - 2`; `idx1` and `idx2` remain -1 if no early break condition was met; `p1` and `p2` remain 0 if no occurrences of `a2` or `a1` were found that would adjust them; `val` is an empty list if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing one more element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`; `l` is equal to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is equal to `l1` if `a1` comes before `a2` in `l3` or if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, otherwise, `l` is equal to `l2`. `a2` is inserted at the end of `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, and `l2` has `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if the index of `a1` in `l3` is not less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
