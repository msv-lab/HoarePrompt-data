The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('yes')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or conditions mentioned in the initial state. The string `'yes'` is explicitly provided to the `print` function.

Based on the initial state, there is no information that modifies or influences the string `'yes'` in any way. Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
