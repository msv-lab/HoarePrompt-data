Postcondition: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a_next, l_next)`, where `a_next` and `l_next` are the next elements in the list `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `l` with all occurrences of `a3` removed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the program state.**
