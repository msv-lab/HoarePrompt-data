The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the index `idx1` in the list `l2`. Given that `idx1` is -1, this operation will insert `a2` at the end of the list `l2` because inserting at index -1 in a list in Python places the element at the last position.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `a1` and `l1` are unchanged, `a2` and `l2` are unchanged except `l2` now includes `a2` at the end, `l11` and `l22` are unchanged, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is less than `idx2`.**
