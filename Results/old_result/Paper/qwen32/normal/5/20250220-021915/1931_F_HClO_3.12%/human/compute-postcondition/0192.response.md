Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is the integer provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`, `i` is 3. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is 3 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is 3 and `p2` is 1. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
