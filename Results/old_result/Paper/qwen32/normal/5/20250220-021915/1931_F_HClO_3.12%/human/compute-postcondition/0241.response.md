The `print` statement in the given code snippet is:

```python
print('no')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'no'`. The initial state describes variables `val`, `a3`, and `l3`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
