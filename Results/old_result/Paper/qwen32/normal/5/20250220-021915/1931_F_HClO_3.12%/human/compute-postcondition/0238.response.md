Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a_next, l_next)`, where `a_next` and `l_next` are the next elements in the list `val` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The list `val` remains unchanged, still containing at least one tuple `(a_next, l_next)`. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but no other variables are affected.
