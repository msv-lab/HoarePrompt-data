Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` are unchanged. `val` is an empty list. If `m` is 2, then `m` remains 2. `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. The index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
