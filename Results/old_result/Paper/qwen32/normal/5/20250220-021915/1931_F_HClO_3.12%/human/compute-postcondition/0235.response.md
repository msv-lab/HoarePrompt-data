Postcondition: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`. The list `l` contains elements such that if `l3` is not equal to the list obtained by removing all occurrences of `a3` from `l`, then the if part executes. If `l3` is equal to the list obtained by removing all occurrences of `a3` from `l`, the else part does not execute and the state remains unchanged.**
