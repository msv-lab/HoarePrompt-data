The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` at the position `idx1` in the list `l2`. This means that the elements in `l2` starting from `idx1` will be shifted one position to the right to make space for `a2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` are unchanged
- `val` is an empty list
- If `m` is 2, then `m` remains 2
- `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`
- `a3` is the first integer from the input
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- The index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`

After the execution of `l2.insert(idx1, a2)`, the list `l2` will have `a2` inserted at position `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2` with `a2` inserted at `idx1`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` are unchanged, `val` is an empty list, if `m` is 2, then `m` remains 2, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.**
