Output State: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is at least 2; `m` is at least 5; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`; `i` is 1; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, and `i` remain unchanged, but we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
