Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `n` and `m` are the two integers provided as input, `a1` is the first integer from the input line, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input line, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input line, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` except those equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` except those equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the program continues with the current state of variables. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.**
