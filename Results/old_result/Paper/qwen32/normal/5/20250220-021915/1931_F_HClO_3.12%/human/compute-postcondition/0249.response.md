The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Since the provided code snippet only contains a `continue` statement, it does not change the values of any variables or perform any calculations. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; an additional input is read but not assigned to any variable.**
