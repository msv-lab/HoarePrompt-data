To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to carefully analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions under which it terminates.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates `n-1` times, but it can break early under certain conditions:
1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the loop breaks.
2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, and the loop breaks.
3. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and either `l1[i + p1] == a2` or `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `i` respectively, and `p1` or `p2` is set to `1`. If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the loop breaks.

### Iteration Analysis:
- **First Iteration (i=0):** 
  - If `l1[p1] != l2[p2]`, `idx1` or `idx2` is set based on the value of `l1[p1]` or `l2[p2]` respectively.
  - If `l1[p1] == a2` and `l2[p2] == a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `0`, and the loop breaks.
- **Second Iteration (i=1):**
  - Similar to the first iteration, but now `p1` or `p2` might be `1` if `a2` or `a1` was found in the previous iteration.
  - If `l1[1 + p1] == a2` and `l2[1 + p2] == a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `1`, and the loop breaks.
- **Third Iteration (i=2):**
  - Again, similar checks are performed.
  - If `l1[2 + p1] == a2` and `l2[2 + p2] == a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `2`, and the loop breaks.

### General Case:
The loop will continue until one of the following happens:
1. `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` (i.e., the loop reaches the maximum number of iterations allowed).
2. `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` for some `i`, setting `idx1` and `idx2` to `i` and breaking the loop.
3. Both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to non-negative values, breaking the loop.

### Final Output State:
The final output state depends on when the loop breaks. If the loop breaks due to `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain `-1` unless they were set earlier. If the loop breaks due to finding `a2` and `a1` in corresponding positions, `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to the index where this happened.

Given the constraints and the loop behavior, the final state will be:

Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n and m are integers obtained from the input; a1 and a2 are integers from the input lines; l1 and l2 are lists from the input lines; l11 and l22 are lists created by removing occurrences of a2 from l1 and a1 from l2 respectively; idx1 and idx2 are set to the index where l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1, or -1 if no such index is found; p1 and p2 are set to 1 if a2 or a1 was found in the respective lists, otherwise 0.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is determined by whether the loop found a pair of `a2` and `a1` at the same adjusted index in `l1` and `l2`, and if so, `idx1` and `idx2` will reflect that index. If no such pair is found within the allowed iterations, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain `-1`.
