Postcondition: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` must be at least 2; `m` is at least 5; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`; If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, then `m - 5` new lines of input are read but not assigned to any variable; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1; `p1` is 0; `p2` is 0; `i` is 0; `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`**
