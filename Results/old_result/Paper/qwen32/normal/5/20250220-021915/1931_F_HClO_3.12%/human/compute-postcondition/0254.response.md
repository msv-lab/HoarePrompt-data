Output State: **`t` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `a1` is the first integer from the new input line; `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input line; `a2` is the first integer from the latest input line; `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`; `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` that contains all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
