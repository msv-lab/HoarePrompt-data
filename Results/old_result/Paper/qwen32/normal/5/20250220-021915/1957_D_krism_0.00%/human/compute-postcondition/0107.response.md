The variable `c` is assigned the value of `prefix[i]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is unchanged, `ans` is `2 * (pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1])`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`, `c` is `prefix[i]`**.
