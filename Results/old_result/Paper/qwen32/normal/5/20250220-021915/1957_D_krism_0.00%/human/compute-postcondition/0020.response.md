Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[0, 0]`.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop completes all 32 iterations, each of the 32 sublists in `pre` will have its first element incremented by 1 for each iteration, resulting in all `pre[i][0]` being 1. The second element of each sublist in `pre` remains 0 as it is not modified by the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, and `prefix` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The list `suf` remains unchanged with all its sublists initialized to `[0, 0]`.
