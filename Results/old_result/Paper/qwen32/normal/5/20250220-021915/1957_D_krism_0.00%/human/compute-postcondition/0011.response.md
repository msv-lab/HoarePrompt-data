Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line.
- `prefix` is a list defined as \([0, v1, v2 \oplus v1, v3 \oplus (v2 \oplus v1), \ldots, vn \oplus (vn-1 \oplus \ldots \oplus v1)]\), where \(\oplus\) denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(arr, prefix)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`arr`**: This is a list of integers that is directly read from the input. The exact values of these integers are not specified, but we know that `arr` contains `n` integers.
2. **`prefix`**: This list is constructed using the bitwise XOR operation. The first element is `0`. Each subsequent element is the cumulative XOR of the elements of `arr` up to that point. Specifically:
   - `prefix[0] = 0`
   - `prefix[1] = arr[0]`
   - `prefix[2] = arr[1] \oplus arr[0]`
   - `prefix[3] = arr[2] \oplus arr[1] \oplus arr[0]`
   - and so on, up to `prefix[n] = arr[n-1] \oplus arr[n-2] \oplus \ldots \oplus arr[0]`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the entire `arr` list followed by the `prefix` list. Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the structure of the output based on the given information.

### Final Output:
Output: **arr (where arr is a list of n integers read from the input), prefix (where prefix is a list constructed as [0, arr[0], arr[1] ^ arr[0], arr[2] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[0], ..., arr[n-1] ^ arr[n-2] ^ ... ^ arr[0]])**
