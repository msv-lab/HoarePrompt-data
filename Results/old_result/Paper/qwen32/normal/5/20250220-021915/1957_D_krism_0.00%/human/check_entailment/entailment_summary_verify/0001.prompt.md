You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers from the input. It then computes and prints a result based on the XOR prefix of the list and the bit distribution of the elements in the list. The function prints intermediate results including the original list, the XOR prefix list, and two 32x2 matrices `pre` and `suf`. Finally, it prints the computed result `ans` which is derived from the bit counts in `pre` and `suf`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that:
1. \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n\)
2. \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\)

Where \(f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r}\).

### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program computes the prefix XOR array `prefix` such that `prefix[i] = a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{i-1}`.
   - This is done correctly by iterating over the array and updating the prefix XOR value.

3. **Initialization of `pre` and `suf`:**
   - `pre` and `suf` are 2D arrays of size 32x2, initialized with zeros.
   - `pre` is supposed to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position for the prefix XOR values.
   - `suf` is supposed to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position for the suffix XOR values.

4. **Populating `pre` and `suf`:**
   - The program initializes `pre[i][0]` to 1 for all i (which seems incorrect as it does not reflect the actual counts).
   - It then attempts to populate `suf` by iterating over the array in reverse and updating the counts based on the prefix XOR values.
   - However, the logic to update `pre` and `suf` is flawed. It should correctly count the number of 0s and 1s at each bit position for the prefix and suffix XOR values, respectively.

5. **Calculating the Answer:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the array to calculate the number of valid tuples (x, y, z).
   - The logic for updating `ans` is incorrect. It does not correctly compute the number of tuples that satisfy the condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).

### Issues in the Program:
- The initialization of `pre` is incorrect.
- The logic for updating `pre` and `suf` is flawed.
- The logic for calculating the answer is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
