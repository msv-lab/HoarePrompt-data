The code snippet `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the second element of the `j`-th sublist in the `suf` list by 1. Given the initial state, the only variable that is directly affected by this operation is `suf[j][1]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `cur`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line, `prefix` is `[0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)]`, `pre` is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to `[1, 0]`, `cur` is `prefix[i - 1]`, `i` is `i - 1`, `j` is `j + 1` and `j < 32`, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1.**
