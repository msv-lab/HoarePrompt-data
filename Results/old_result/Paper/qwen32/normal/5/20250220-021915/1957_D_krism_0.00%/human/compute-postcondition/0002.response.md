The provided code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. This means `arr` will now hold the integers from the input line.

Given the initial state, the variables `t` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `n` was an input integer indicating the number of integers in the list `a`, but it remains unchanged by this code snippet. The new variable `arr` is introduced to store the integers from the input line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input line.**
