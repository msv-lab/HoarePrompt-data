Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an input integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, arr is a list of integers read from the input line, prefix is [0, v1, v2 ^ v1, v3 ^ (v2 ^ v1), ..., vn ^ (vn-1 ^ ... ^ v1)], pre is a list containing 32 sublists, each initialized to [1, 0], cur is prefix[i - 1], i is i - 1, suf[j][0] is the count of how many times the j-th bit of cur was 0 across all 32 iterations, suf[j][1] is the count of how many times the j-th bit of cur was 1 across all 32 iterations, j is 32.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all 32 iterations, each bit position (from 0 to 31) of the variable `cur` has been checked. The `suf` list now contains the counts of how many times each bit was 0 or 1 across these 32 iterations. The variable `j` has reached 32, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states or states after the first 3 iterations, as they are not modified within the loop.
