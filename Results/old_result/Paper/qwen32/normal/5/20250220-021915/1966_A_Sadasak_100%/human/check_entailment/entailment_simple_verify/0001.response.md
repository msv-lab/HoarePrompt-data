### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program, using the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Problem Understanding
The task is to minimize the number of cards in hand by repeatedly exchanging groups of `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards of any numbers.

#### Key Points
1. **Exchange Operation**: We can exchange any `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` cards with any numbers.
2. **Objective**: Minimize the number of cards remaining in the hand.

#### Strategy
1. **Count Frequencies**: Determine the frequency of each card number.
2. **Exchange Groups**: For each card number with a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, we can repeatedly exchange groups of `k` cards for `k-1` cards.
3. **Calculate Remaining Cards**: After performing the exchanges, calculate the number of cards remaining.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `k > n`, no operations can be performed, and the number of cards remains `n`. This part is correctly handled.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number but truncates the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is incorrect because we need the actual frequencies to determine how many exchanges can be made.

4. **Logic for Determining Minimum Cards**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if true. This is incorrect because:
     - The value `k` in the frequency table does not necessarily mean that we can achieve `k-1` cards.
     - The program does not correctly account for the number of exchanges that can be made based on the actual frequencies.

#### Correct Approach
- **Calculate Actual Frequencies**: Use a dictionary to count the actual number of occurrences of each card number.
- **Perform Exchanges**: For each card number with frequency `f`, compute the number of exchanges as `f // k` and the remaining cards as `f % k`.
- **Sum Remaining Cards**: Sum the remaining cards for all card numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

#### Evaluation Using Annotations

The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before the function call and within the function. However, the logic and the final decision-making process are flawed.

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The frequency table is built correctly, but the truncation to `k` is incorrect.

2. **Decision Making**:
   - The check `if k in freq.values():` is incorrect. The program does not correctly calculate the remaining cards after performing the allowed exchanges.

#### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed exchanges. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
