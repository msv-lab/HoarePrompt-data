Postcondition: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is set to `i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `num` and the flow continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
