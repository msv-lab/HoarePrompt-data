You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. Each of the following n lines contains two integers a and x, where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. a=1 indicates k must be greater than or equal to x, a=2 indicates k must be less than or equal to x, and a=3 indicates k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same (all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

    #State: `iterable` is `loop`, `innerLoop` is the value from the last iteration, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1` from the last iteration, `big`, `less`, and `no` are the lists from the last iteration, `num` is the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a set of constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it determines the smallest integer `k` that satisfies all given constraints and prints this value. The constraints specify that `k` must be greater than or equal to certain values, less than or equal to certain values, and not equal to certain values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`loop`).
   - For each test case, it initializes three empty lists: `less`, `big`, and `no` to store constraints of type 2, 1, and 3, respectively.
   - It also initializes `num` to 0, which seems to be intended to count the number of valid `k` values, but it is used incorrectly in the program.
   - It then reads the number of constraints (`innerLoop`) for the current test case.

2. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, it reads the type (`x`) and the value (`a`).
   - Depending on the type, it appends the value to the corresponding list (`less`, `big`, or `no`).

3. **Finding Valid `k` Values:**
   - The program attempts to find the range of valid `k` values by iterating from `max(big)` to `min(less)`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current value `i` is not in the `no` list.
   - If `i` is not in `no`, it sets `num` to `i` and breaks the loop. This logic is incorrect because it only finds the first valid `k` value instead of counting all valid `k` values.
   - Finally, it prints `num`, which is incorrect as it should print the count of all valid `k` values.

### Issues with the Program:
- The program does not correctly count the number of valid `k` values. Instead, it only finds the first valid `k` value and prints it.
- The variable `num` is used incorrectly. It should be used to count the number of valid `k` values, not to store the first valid `k` value.
- The logic for counting valid `k` values is missing. The program should iterate through the range and increment a counter for each valid `k` value.

### Correctness:
Given the issues outlined above, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
