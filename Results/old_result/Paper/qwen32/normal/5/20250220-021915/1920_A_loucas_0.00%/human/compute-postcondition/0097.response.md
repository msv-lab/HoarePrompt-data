The code snippet `big = []` explicitly sets the variable `big` to an empty list. This change affects the `big` variable, which was previously stated to contain all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was 1. Now, `big` is reset to an empty list.

The other variables (`num`, `iterable`, `loop`, `innerLoop`, `less`, `no`, and `iterable2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration.**
