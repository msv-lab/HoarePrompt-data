Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 1, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the new input, `a` is the second integer from the new input. If `x` is 1, `big` contains three instances of `a`, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` contains `a`, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` contains `a`.**
