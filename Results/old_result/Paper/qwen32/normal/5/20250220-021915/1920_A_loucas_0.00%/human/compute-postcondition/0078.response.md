Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `big` is a list containing `a` three times if `x` is 1, or `big` is a list containing `a` twice if `x` is not 1, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is not 2, or `less` is a list containing `a` three times if `x` is 2, `no` is a list containing `a` three times if `x` is 1 or 2, and `no` contains `a` three times if `x` is not 1 or 2, `iterable2` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
