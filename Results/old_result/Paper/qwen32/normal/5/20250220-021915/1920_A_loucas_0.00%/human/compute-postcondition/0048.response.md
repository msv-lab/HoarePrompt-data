In the provided task, the loop head only contains the variable `iterable`. The state at the end of the previous iteration does not mention `iterable` directly, but it does provide context about how `num` is determined. However, the loop condition and the variables it depends on are `iterable` and `loop`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for iterable in range(loop):
    # the loop body is omit
```
The loop will continue to execute as long as `iterable` is less than `loop`. The state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide the current value of `iterable`, but we can infer that at the start of the next iteration, `iterable` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the task specifies that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we should adjust `iterable` and ensure that `loop` remains unchanged.

Let's assume `iterable` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `iterable` should be `x + 1`.

State: **`num` is set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no`, `iterable` is `x + 1`, `loop` is unchanged**

However, since the exact value of `iterable` at the end of the previous iteration (`x`) is not provided, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`num` is set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no`, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged**

If we assume `iterable` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, the state would be:

State: **`num` is set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no`, `iterable` is `x + 1`, `loop` is unchanged**

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can leave it in a generalized form:

State: **`num` is set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no`, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged**

For the sake of providing a concrete example, let's assume `iterable` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration. Then the state would be:

State: **`num` is set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no`, `iterable` is 3, `loop` is unchanged**

If the exact value of `iterable` is not specified, the most accurate state would be:

State: **`num` is set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no`, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged**

Given the lack of a specific value for `iterable`, the final answer in a generalized form is:

State: **`num` is set to the first value `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no`, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged**
