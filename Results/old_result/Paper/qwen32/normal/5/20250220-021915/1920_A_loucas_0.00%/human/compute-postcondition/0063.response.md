Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input and `x` is not equal to 1, `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. Otherwise, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**
