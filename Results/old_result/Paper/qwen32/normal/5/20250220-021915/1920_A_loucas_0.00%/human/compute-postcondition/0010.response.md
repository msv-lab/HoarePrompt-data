Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is 1, `a` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. All other variables remain unchanged.
