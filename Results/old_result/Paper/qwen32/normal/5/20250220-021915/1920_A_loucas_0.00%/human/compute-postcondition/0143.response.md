Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines each containing two integers `a` and `x`. The integer `a` specifies the type of constraint (1 for k >= x, 2 for k <= x, 3 for k != x). The function returns the smallest integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints for each test case.**
