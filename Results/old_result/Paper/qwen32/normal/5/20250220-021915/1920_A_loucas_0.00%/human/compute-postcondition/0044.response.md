Output State: **`big` is a list or iterable with a maximum value, `less` is a list or iterable with a minimum value such that `max(big) < min(less)`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `num` is equal to the previous value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the variables `big` and `less` remain unchanged, and their properties (where `max(big) < min(less)`) still hold. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `num` retains the value of `i` before it was incremented. The program execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
