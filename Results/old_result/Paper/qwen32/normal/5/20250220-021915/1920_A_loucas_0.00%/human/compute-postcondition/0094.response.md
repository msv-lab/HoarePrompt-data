Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `num` is 0.
2. `iterable` is incremented by the number of iterations, but its value is not directly relevant to the `print(num)` statement.
3. `loop` is unchanged, but its value is not directly relevant to the `print(num)` statement.
4. `innerLoop` is greater than 0, but its value is not directly relevant to the `print(num)` statement.
5. `big` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was 1, but its value is not directly relevant to the `print(num)` statement.
6. `less` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was 2, but its value is not directly relevant to the `print(num)` statement.
7. `no` contains all `a` values where the corresponding `x` was neither 1 nor 2, but its value is not directly relevant to the `print(num)` statement.
8. `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` after the final iteration, but its value is not directly relevant to the `print(num)` statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(num)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(num)` statement will output the value of the variable `num`.
- According to the initial state, `num` is explicitly defined as 0.

### Conclusion:
The `print(num)` statement will print the value of `num`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
