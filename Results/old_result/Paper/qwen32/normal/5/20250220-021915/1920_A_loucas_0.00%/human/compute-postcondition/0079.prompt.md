Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `innerLoop` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, and `a` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing `a`, and `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing `a`, and `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `less` and `big` are empty lists.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `big` is a list containing `a` twice if `x` is 1, or `big` is a list containing `a` once if `x` is not 1, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is 2, or `less` is a list containing `a` twice if `x` is 2, `no` is a list containing `a` if `x` is not 1 or 2, and `no` contains `a` twice if `x` is not 1 or 2, `iterable2` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is 0, `iterable` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, `loop` is unchanged, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `x` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `big` is a list containing `a` three times if `x` is 1, or `big` is a list containing `a` twice if `x` is not 1, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` is not 2, or `less` is a list containing `a` three times if `x` is 2, `no` is a list containing `a` three times if `x` is 1 or 2, and `no` contains `a` three times if `x` is not 1 or 2, `iterable2` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
