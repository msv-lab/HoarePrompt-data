The code snippet assigns a new value to `d[i + 1]` based on the value of `d[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the code sets `d[3]` to `d[2] - 1`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `d[2]`. Therefore, we can only express the value of `d[3]` in terms of `d[2]`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `1`. If `s[1]` is '(', then `d[0]` is `1` and `d[1]` is `1`. If `s[1]` is ')', then `d[0]` is `-1` and `d[1]` is `0`. `i` is 2, `d[3]` is `d[2] - 1`.**
