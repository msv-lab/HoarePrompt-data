The code snippet `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, the string `s` consists only of "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is initially an empty string, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by cumulative balance of parentheses. After executing the code, `ans` will no longer be an empty string but will contain the character `s[i]`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing `s[i]`, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by cumulative balance of parentheses and must contain at least one tuple.**
