#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and s is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':

    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys from `0` to `n` where `d[n]` is `0` and the values at other keys represent the cumulative balance of parentheses at each step, `i` is `n-1`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a string formed by concatenating the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the tuples in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string 'ans' which is formed by concatenating the characters from the string 's' at the indices specified by the tuples in the list 'd'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a balanced parentheses string `s` as input and returns a new string `ans` formed by rearranging the characters of `s` based on the cumulative balance of parentheses at each step.
