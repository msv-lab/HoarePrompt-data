The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `d`. If there are more tuples in `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by cumulative balance of parentheses and must contain at least one tuple. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `d` must contain at least one more tuple, and `(i, j)` should be the next tuple in `d`.

Given that `d` contains at least one tuple and the loop has just finished processing one of them, we need to adjust the state such that `(i, j)` is the next tuple in `d`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing `s[i]`, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by cumulative balance of parentheses and must contain at least one more tuple.**
