The code snippet updates the dictionary `d` by setting `d[i + 1]` to the value of `d[i] + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `d[i]` (which is `d[0]`) is 0. Therefore, `d[i + 1]` (which is `d[1]`) will be set to `0 + 1`, which is 1. 

The values of `s`, `n`, `ans`, `i`, and the current character at index `i` in `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `1` and values `0` and `1` respectively, `i` is 0, and the current character at index `i` in `s` is '('**.
