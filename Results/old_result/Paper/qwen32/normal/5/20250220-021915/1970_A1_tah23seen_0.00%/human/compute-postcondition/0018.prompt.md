Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with the key `0` and value `0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    if s[i] == '(':
        d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
    else:
        d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `1` where the value of key `0` is `0` and the value of key `1` is `1` if the character at index `i` in `s` is '(', and the value of key `1` is `-1` if the character at index `i` in `s` is ')', `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys `0` and `1`. If `s[1]` is '(', then `d[0]` is `1` and `d[1]` is `1`. If `s[1]` is ')', then `d[0]` is `-1` and `d[1]` is `0`. `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with keys `0`, `1`, and `3`. If `s[1]` is '(', then `d[0]` is `1` and `d[1]` is `1`. If `s[1]` is ')', then `d[0]` is `-1` and `d[1]` is `0`. If `s[i]` is '(', then `d[3]` is `d[2] + 1`. If `s[i]` is ')', then `d[3]` is `d[2] - 1`. `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
