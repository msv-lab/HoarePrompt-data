The code snippet `ans += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `s` to the string `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing `s[i]` appended to its previous value, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by cumulative balance of parentheses and must contain at least one more tuple, `(i, j)` is the next tuple from `d`.** 

In simpler terms, `ans` now includes the character `s[i]` added to its previous content. All other variables retain their original values.
