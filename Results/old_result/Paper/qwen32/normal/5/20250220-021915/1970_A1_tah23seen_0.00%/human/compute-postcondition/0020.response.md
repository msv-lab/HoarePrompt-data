The code snippet sorts the dictionary `d` by its values and reassigns it to `d`. The keys of the dictionary are indices from `0` to `n-1`, and the values are cumulative balances of parentheses at each step. After sorting, `d` will be a list of tuples where each tuple contains an index and its corresponding cumulative balance, sorted by the cumulative balance.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by cumulative balance of parentheses, `i` is `n-1`.**
