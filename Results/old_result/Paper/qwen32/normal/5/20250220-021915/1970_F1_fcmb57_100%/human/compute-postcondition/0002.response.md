Output State: **The program returns a tuple where the first element is the string `x` concatenated with the integer `dx`, and the second element is the string `y` concatenated with the integer `dy`.**

In simpler terms, the program combines the string `x` with the value of `dx` and the string `y` with the value of `dy`, and returns both as a tuple.
