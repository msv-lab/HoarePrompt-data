a is a list of strings representing the field, where each string contains pairs of characters separated by spaces. The first line of a contains two integers N and M (3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99, and both are odd). The subsequent N lines each contain M pairs of characters representing the field's initial state. b is a list of strings, where each string describes an action performed by an entity in the format specified in the problem description. The number of actions in b is T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000).
