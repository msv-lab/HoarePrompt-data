### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the given function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Function Summary:
- **Function `func_1`:** The summary provided is incorrect. The function `func_1` is supposed to take two tuples representing coordinates and return a new tuple with the coordinates updated based on the movement specified. The summary incorrectly describes it as concatenating strings.

#### Issues in the Program:

1. **Handling of Quaffle Position:**
   - The program does not update the Quaffle's position when it is thrown. The Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
   - **Issue:** The Quaffle's position is not updated in the `players` dictionary or anywhere else.
   - **Fix:** After a goal is scored, the Quaffle's position should be reset to the middle of the field.

2. **Goal Scoring Logic:**
   - The program checks if a player is on a goal position but does not differentiate between scoring in the correct goal or the wrong goal.
   - **Issue:** If a player scores in their own goal, the other team should win the point.
   - **Fix:** The program should check which goal the player is on and update the score accordingly.

3. **Catching the Quaffle:**
   - The program does not handle the action of catching the Quaffle.
   - **Issue:** The Quaffle's position should be updated to the player's position when caught, and the player should be marked as carrying the Quaffle.
   - **Fix:** Implement logic to update the Quaffle's position and track which player is carrying the Quaffle.

4. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program does not check for boundary conditions when a player moves.
   - **Issue:** Although the problem guarantees valid actions, it is good practice to ensure players do not move out of the field boundaries.
   - **Fix:** Add boundary checks when updating player positions.

### Corrected Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program addressing the above issues:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle = None  # Track the position of the Quaffle

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quaffle = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        dx, dy = mouvements[mo[1]]
        x, y = players[mo[0]]
        players[mo[0]] = (x + dx, y + dy)
        if mo[0] == quaffle:
            quaffle = (x + dx, y + dy)  # Move the Quaffle if the player carrying it moves
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        if players[mo[0]] == quaffle:
            quaffle = mo[0]  # Mark the player as carrying the Quaffle
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if quaffle == mo[0]:  # Check if the player is carrying the Quaffle
            x, y = players[mo[0]]
            if (x, y) in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            elif (x, y) in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                # Handle the case where the Quaffle is thrown but not into any goal
                pass
            # Reset the Quaffle to the middle of the field
            quaffle = ((m + 1) // 2 - 1, (n + 1) // 2 - 1)

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

### Evaluation:
The original assessment is **correct** because the provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly implementing the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. The corrected version addresses these issues.

**Final:** **False**
