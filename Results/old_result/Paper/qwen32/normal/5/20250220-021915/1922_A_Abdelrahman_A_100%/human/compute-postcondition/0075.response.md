The code snippet `no = False` changes the value of the variable `no` from `True` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is the new input value; `b` is the new input value; `c` is the new input value from `input()`; `i` is the current iteration index + 2; `no` is False.**
