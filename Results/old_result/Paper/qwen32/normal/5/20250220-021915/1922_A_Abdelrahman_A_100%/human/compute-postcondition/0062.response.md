Postcondition: **`tests` is greater than 0, `slength` is a new input integer, `a` is the new input value, `b` is the new input value, `c` is a list with at least two elements where `c[0]` is found in either `a[0]` or `b[0]`, `i` is the current iteration index + 1, `counter` is 2, `x` is `c[2]`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, `no` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains as described in the precondition.**
