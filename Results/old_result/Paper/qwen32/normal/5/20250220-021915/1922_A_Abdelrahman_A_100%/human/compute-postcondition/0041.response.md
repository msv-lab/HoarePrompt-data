Output State: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is a new input integer; `a` is the new input value; `b` is the new input value; `c` is the new input value; if `no` is `True`, then the new `c` must be neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`, and every element `x` in `c` must be found in either `a[counter]` or `b[counter]` with `counter` equal to the length of `c`. If `no` is `False`, the conditions regarding `c`, `a`, `b`, and `counter` remain as described in the precondition; `i` is the current iteration index + 1; `no` is `True`.**

Explanation: The variable `no` has been set to `True`, while all other variables retain their initial conditions as described.
