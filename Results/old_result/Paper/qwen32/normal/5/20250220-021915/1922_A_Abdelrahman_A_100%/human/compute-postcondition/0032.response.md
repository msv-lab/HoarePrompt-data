Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is an input integer; `a` is an input value; `b` is an input value; `c` is an input value; if `c` equals `a` or `c` equals `b`, then `no` is False. Otherwise, `no` is `False` if any element `x` in `c` was not found in `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`, otherwise `no` is `True`; `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b` if `no` is `True`; `counter` is equal to the length of `c` if `no` is `True`.**
