To determine the state before the for loop starts such that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head. In the provided loop:

```python
for i in range(tests):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `tests`. The loop will execute if `tests` is greater than 0 because `range(tests)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `tests-1`.

Given the state before the loop starts is:
- `tests` is an integer read from input.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.

We need to ensure that `tests` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly related to the execution of this specific for loop, so we do not need to adjust them.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `tests` is greater than 0. 

State: **`tests` must be greater than 0**
