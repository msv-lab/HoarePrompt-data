Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0; `slength` is a new input integer; `a` is the new input value; `b` is the new input value; `c` is the new input value; `i` is the current iteration index + 1. If `c` is equal to `a` or `c` is equal to `b`, then `no` is `False`. Otherwise, `no` is `True` and every element `x` in `c` must be found in either `a[counter]` or `b[counter]` with `counter` equal to the length of `c`.**
