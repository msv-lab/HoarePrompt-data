You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where each operation consists of splitting the array into two parts and swapping these two parts.

### Key Insight

The operation of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them can be seen as rotating the array. Specifically, any rotation of the array can be achieved by a series of such operations. Therefore, the question reduces to whether the array can be rotated to become sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to check if there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order. One way to do this is to check if there is a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the second part is less than or equal to the first part and both parts are individually sorted.

### Given Program Analysis

Let's analyze the provided program:

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there is any element that is greater than the next element using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If such an element exists, it returns 'No'. If not, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and calls `func_1(arr)` to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation.
   - It stores the results and prints them at the end.

### Issues in the Program

The main issue with the program is in the logic of `func_1(arr)`. The function only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is any element that is greater than the next element. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array can be rotated to become sorted.

For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`. This array is not sorted, and there is an element that is greater than the next element (`3 > 1`). However, by rotating the array, we can get `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted. The current implementation would incorrectly return 'No' for this array.

### Correctness

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
