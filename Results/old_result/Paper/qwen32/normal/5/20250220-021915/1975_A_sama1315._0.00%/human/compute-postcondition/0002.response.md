The code provided initializes the variable `index` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the list `arr` of `n` positive integers and the list `data` of strings remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each string is a positive integer from the input; `index` is 0.**
