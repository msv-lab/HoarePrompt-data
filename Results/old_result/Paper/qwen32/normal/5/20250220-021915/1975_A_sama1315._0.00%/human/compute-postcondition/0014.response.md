The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is derived from `data[0]` minus 1. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `n` and the unchanged value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**.
