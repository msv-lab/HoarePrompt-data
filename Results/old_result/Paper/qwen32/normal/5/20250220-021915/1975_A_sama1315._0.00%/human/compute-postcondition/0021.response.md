The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. The variable `t` is not affected by this operation and retains its initial value, which is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**.
