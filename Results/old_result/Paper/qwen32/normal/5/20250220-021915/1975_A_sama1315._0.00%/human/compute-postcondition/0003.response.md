The code snippet converts the string at the position `index` in the `data` list to an integer and assigns it to the variable `t`. The value of `index` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`arr`, `data`) are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each string is a positive integer from the input; `index` is 0; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.**
