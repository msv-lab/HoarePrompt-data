### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotations to determine whether the program correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where the operation involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
    - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
    - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
    - If the array is not sorted, it checks for any descending order elements using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
    - If there are descending order elements, it returns 'No'.
    - If there are no descending order elements (which is logically impossible if the array is not sorted), it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
    - It collects the results and prints them.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The logic in `func_1(arr)` is flawed. The condition `return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'` is incorrect. Just because there are descending order elements doesn't mean the array cannot be sorted using the described operation.
- The correct approach would be to check if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped.

#### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`:
- The array is not sorted.
- However, it can be split into `[3]` and `[1, 2]`, and swapped to `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.

The provided program would incorrectly return 'No' for this array.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping, the program needs to check if there exists a point in the array where the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped. This involves checking if there is a point where the array can be split such that the remaining part of the array is non-decreasing.

#### Annotations:
The annotations provided do not address the core issue with the logic in `func_1`. They simply state that the function checks if the array is sorted and returns 'No' if it finds any descending order elements, which is not sufficient for solving the problem as described.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
