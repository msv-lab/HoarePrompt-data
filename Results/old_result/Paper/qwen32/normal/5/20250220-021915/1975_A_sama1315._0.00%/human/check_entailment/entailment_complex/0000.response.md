### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where each operation involves swapping a prefix and a suffix of the array. 

The solution provided in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` seems to have a fundamental flaw. Specifically, `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order and returns 'No' if it is not, without considering if the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operations.

Let's break down the problem and the solution:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
    - We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by swapping prefixes and suffixes.
    - A key insight here is that the array can be sorted if there exists a point in the array where the sequence can be split into two parts such that the second part is less than or equal to the first part when swapped. Essentially, we need to find if there exists an index `i` such that the array can be split into `a[0:i]` and `a[i:n]` and `a[i:n] + a[0:i]` is sorted.

2. **Solution Analysis**:
    - `func_1` simply checks if the array is already sorted. This is not sufficient because the array might not be sorted initially but can become sorted after some swaps.
    - `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`, but since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the solution provided is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operations. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
