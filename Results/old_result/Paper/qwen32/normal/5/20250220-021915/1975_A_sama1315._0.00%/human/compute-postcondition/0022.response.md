The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `index` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `index` is increased by 1.**
