Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `index` is increased by `n`; `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`; `results` has `result` appended to it.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `results` now includes the `result` from `func_1(arr)`, while all other variables retain their previously described states or have been updated as specified in the initial state description.
