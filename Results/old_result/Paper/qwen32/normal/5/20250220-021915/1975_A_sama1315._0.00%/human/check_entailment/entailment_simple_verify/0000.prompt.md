You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing zero or more operations where the operation involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
- The program should output "Yes" if it's possible to sort the array using the described operation, otherwise "No".

### Given Program:
```python
#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
    - The function first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
    - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
    - If the array is not sorted, it checks for any descending order elements using `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
    - If there are descending order elements, it returns 'No'.
    - If there are no descending order elements (which is logically impossible if the array is not sorted), it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
    - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case.
    - It collects the results and prints them.

### Issues:
- The logic in `func_1(arr)` is flawed. The condition `return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'` is incorrect. Just because there are descending order elements doesn't mean the array cannot be sorted using the described operation.
- The correct approach would be to check if there exists a point in the array where the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix is less than or equal to the prefix when swapped.

### Counterexample:
Consider the array `[3, 1, 2]`:
- The array is not sorted.
- However, it can be split into `[3]` and `[1, 2]`, and swapped to `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.

The provided program would incorrectly return 'No' for this array.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix.

Correctness: **False**.
