The code snippet provided updates the `arr` variable by mapping the elements from the `data` list starting from the `index` position up to `index + n` to integers. Given the initial state, `arr` was a list of `n` positive integers, and `data` is a list of strings where the first element is a positive integer (`t`), the second element is the integer `n`, and the subsequent elements are the string representations of the integers that will populate `arr`.

After executing the code, `arr` is now a list of integers derived from the slice of `data` starting at `index` and ending at `index + n`. The values of `data`, `index`, `t`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `index` is 2; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
