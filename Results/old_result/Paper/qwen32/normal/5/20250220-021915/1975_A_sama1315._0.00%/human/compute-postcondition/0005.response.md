The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `arr`, `data`, `index`, or `t`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of `n` positive integers where 2 <= `n` <= 50, and each element `a_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `data` is a list of strings, each string is a positive integer from the input; `index` is 1; `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list.**
