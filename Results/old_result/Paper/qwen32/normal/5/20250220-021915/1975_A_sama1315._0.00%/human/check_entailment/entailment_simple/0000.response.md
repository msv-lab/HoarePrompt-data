### Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a series of prefix-suffix swaps. Let's break down the logic and see if it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - This function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   
   However, the function's second return statement is redundant and incorrect. The first `if` condition already covers the case where the array is sorted, and the `else` part of the second return statement is unreachable because the `if` condition already returns 'Yes' if the array is sorted. The second return statement should only check for the unsorted condition and return 'No' if the array is not sorted. The correct logic should be:
   ```python
   if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)):
       return 'Yes'
   return 'No'
   ```

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes each test case, and collects the results.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It calls `func_1(arr)` for each test case and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints all the results.

### Correctness:

The program as described has a logical issue in `func_1(arr)`. The second return statement is unnecessary and potentially misleading. However, the core logic of checking if the array is sorted is correct. If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Given the examples provided in the problem statement:
- For the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, the function should return 'No' because no prefix-suffix swap can sort this array.
- For the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, the function should return 'Yes' because a series of swaps can sort this array.
- For the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the function should return 'Yes' because the array is already sorted.

The program will correctly return 'No' for the first example and 'Yes' for the other two examples if the second return statement in `func_1(arr)` is removed or corrected.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is mostly correct, but the second return statement in `func_1(arr)` is redundant and potentially misleading. It should be removed or corrected to ensure clarity and correctness.
