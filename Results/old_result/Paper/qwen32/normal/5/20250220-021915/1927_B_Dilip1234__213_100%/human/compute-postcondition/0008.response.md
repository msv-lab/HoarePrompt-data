Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `s` is 'a', `char_count[j]` is `a[i] + 1`, and all other elements in `char_count` are 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string and `char_count` remains a list of 26 zeros.**
