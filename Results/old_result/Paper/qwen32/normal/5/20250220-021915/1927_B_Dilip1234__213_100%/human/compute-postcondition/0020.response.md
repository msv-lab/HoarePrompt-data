The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is 1**
