The code snippet appends a character to the string `s` based on the value of `j`. Given `j` is 0, the character appended to `s` will be 'a' (since `chr(0 + ord('a'))` is 'a').

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is 'a', `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`.**
