You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string containing `n` characters, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where each entry reflects the number of times the corresponding character was added to `s`, `i` is `n`.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` containing `n` characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` generates a string `s` of `n` characters based on the input list `a` where each element in `a` specifies the position at which the next unused character from 'a' to 'z' should be placed in the string. The function returns this generated string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Understanding:
We need to reconstruct a string `s` from its trace `a`. The trace `a` is an array where each element `a_i` indicates how many times the character at position `i` in the string `s` has appeared before it. For example, if `a_i` is 2, it means that the character at position `i` in `s` has appeared twice before position `i`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`. It then calls a function `func_1(n, a)` to generate the string `s`.

Let's break down the `func_1` function:
1. It initializes an empty string `s` and a list `char_count` of size 26 (for each lowercase letter in the alphabet) with all elements set to 0. This list will keep track of how many times each character has been used in the string `s` so far.
2. For each position `i` in the trace array `a`:
   - It iterates through each possible character (from 0 to 25, representing 'a' to 'z').
   - When it finds a character whose count in `char_count` matches `a[i]`, it appends this character to `s` and increments its count in `char_count`.
   - The inner loop breaks after finding and appending the correct character, ensuring that the next character in `s` is chosen based on the trace `a`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly iterates through each test case and generates a string `s` based on the trace `a`.
- The logic of matching the character count with the trace value is sound. It ensures that the character at position `i` in `s` has appeared `a[i]` times before it.
- The program guarantees that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and the number of test cases does not exceed \(10^4\). These constraints are manageable within the time and space limits.

Given that the problem guarantees a valid answer exists for each test case, and the program correctly implements the logic to find such an answer, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
