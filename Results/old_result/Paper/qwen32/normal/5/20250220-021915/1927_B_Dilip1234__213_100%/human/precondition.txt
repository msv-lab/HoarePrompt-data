n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the length of the lost string, and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5 and that a valid string s exists for the given trace.
