Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[2]` which is 1, `s` is 'c'**

In this output state, the value of `char_count[2]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1, while all other variables retain their initial values.
