The code `char_count[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` of the `char_count` list by 1. Given the initial state, `char_count[j]` is initially equal to `a[i]`. After the increment, `char_count[j]` will be `a[i] + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `s` is a string containing a single character `chr(j + ord('a'))`, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros except `char_count[j]` which is `a[i] + 1`, `i` is 1.**
