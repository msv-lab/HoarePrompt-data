The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was mentioned in the initial state.

Since the code only affects the variable `T` and does not change any other variables, the output state will reflect that `T` has been assigned the value of the input integer. All other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) remain unchanged and retain their initial descriptions.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from the input; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that y = 0. Additionally, the second line of each test case consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
