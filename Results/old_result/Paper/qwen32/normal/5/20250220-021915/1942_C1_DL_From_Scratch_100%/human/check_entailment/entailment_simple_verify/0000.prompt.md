You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. The logic used in the program seems to be based on counting gaps between chosen vertices and adding triangles based on those gaps, but it does not take into account the actual formation of triangles within the polygon.

Here is a detailed breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. **Triangle Formation**: The code only considers gaps of size 1 between chosen vertices to form triangles. However, forming triangles involves more than just having a gap of 1. For example, if vertices 1, 3, and 5 are chosen, they can form a triangle, but the code would not count this because the gaps are not of size 1.

2. **Circular Nature of the Polygon**: The code does not properly handle the circular nature of the polygon. It correctly handles the wrap-around case (the gap between the last and first chosen vertex), but it does not account for other possible triangles that can be formed within the polygon.

3. **Maximizing Triangles**: The code does not attempt to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangles. It simply counts certain gaps and adds a fixed number of triangles based on those gaps, which is not the correct approach.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
8 4 0
1 3 5 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
The chosen vertices are 1, 3, 5, and 7. The following triangles can be formed: (1, 3, 5), (1, 5, 7), (1, 3, 7), and (3, 5, 7).

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```

The program only counts the gaps of size 1, which in this case are between (1, 3), (3, 5), (5, 7), and (7, 1). It counts two triangles (between 1 and 3, and between 5 and 7), but it misses the other possible triangles.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
