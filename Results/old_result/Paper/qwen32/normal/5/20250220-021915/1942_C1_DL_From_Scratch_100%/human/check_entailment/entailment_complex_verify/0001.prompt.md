You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: The sequence of results for each test case printed one by one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the gaps between the integers in the list and their positions relative to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: To maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using chosen vertices. Triangles are formed by connecting vertices with non-intersecting diagonals.
2. **Constraints**:
   - The cake is a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - `x` vertices are already chosen by Bessie.
   - No additional vertices (`y = 0`) can be chosen.
3. **Output**: The maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed using the `x` chosen vertices.

### Key Observations:
- Since `y = 0`, we cannot add any new vertices to the set of `x` chosen vertices.
- Triangular pieces can only be formed if there are at least 3 vertices.
- The number of triangular pieces that can be formed is directly related to the number of gaps between the chosen vertices (including the gap between the last and the first vertex due to the polygon's circular nature).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the list of `x` chosen vertices and sorts them.
2. **Counting Triangular Pieces**:
   - The program initializes a count to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list of vertices and checks the difference between consecutive vertices.
   - If the difference is exactly 1, it increments the count (indicating that a triangle can be formed with the current vertex, the next vertex, and the vertex before the current one).
   - It also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex (considering the circular nature of the polygon).
   - Finally, it prints the count plus `x - 2` (which is the maximum number of triangles that can be formed with `x` vertices).

### Issues in the Program:
- The program assumes that a triangle can only be formed if there is exactly one vertex between two chosen vertices. This is incorrect.
- The correct approach is to consider the number of gaps between chosen vertices and use that to calculate the maximum number of triangles.
- The formula `count + x - 2` does not correctly reflect the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.

### Correct Approach:
- For `x` chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2` (this is a well-known result in combinatorial geometry for triangulating a polygon with `x` vertices).
- The program should directly output `x - 2` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed.

**Correctness: False**
