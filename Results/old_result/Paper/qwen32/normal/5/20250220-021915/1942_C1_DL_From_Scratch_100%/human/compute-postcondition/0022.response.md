The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The values of `T`, `num`, and `list0` remain unchanged. Since the current value of `num` is 1 and the expression for `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, this relationship will still hold after the execution of the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`T`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1` and the current value of `num` is 1, `count` is increased by 1.**
