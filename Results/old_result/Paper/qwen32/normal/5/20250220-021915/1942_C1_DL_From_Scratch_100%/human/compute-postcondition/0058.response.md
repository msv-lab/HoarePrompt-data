Postcondition: **`T` is 1, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, `count` is 1 if `num` is 1, otherwise `count` remains 0, `n` and `y` are integers read from the input, `list0` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, `x` is an integer read from the input and must be at least 2, `i` is `x - 2`.**
