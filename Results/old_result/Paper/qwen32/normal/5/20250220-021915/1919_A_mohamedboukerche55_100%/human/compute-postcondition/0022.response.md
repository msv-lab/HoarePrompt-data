The provided code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `i`) and their relationships, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
2. `s` is a string input by the user.
3. `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.
4. `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.
5. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.
6. `i` is set to 5.

Since the `print` statement is `print('Alice')`, it directly outputs the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **Alice**
