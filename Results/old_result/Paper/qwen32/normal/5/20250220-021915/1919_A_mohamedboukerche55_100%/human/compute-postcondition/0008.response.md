Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000 (This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so it is irrelevant for determining the output).
   - `s` is the string input by the user.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.
   - `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.
   - The sum of `a` and `b` is not even (This condition provides information about the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`, but it does not affect the print statement).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Alice')
   ```

The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, `a`, `b`, or any other variables. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

**Output:**
Output: **Alice**
