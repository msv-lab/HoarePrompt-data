Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program determines the winner based solely on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, this logic does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to play the game.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the test case:
```
1
1 2
```
According to the program, the sum of the coins is 3 (odd), so it would print "Alice". However, let's analyze the optimal moves:

1. Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins.
2. Alice cannot swap wallets because she would then have 2 coins and Bob 1, and removing a coin from her wallet would leave her with 0 coins, making Bob win immediately.
3. Alice does not swap and removes 1 coin from her wallet. Now, Alice has 0 coins and Bob has 2 coins.
4. Bob cannot swap wallets because Alice's wallet is already empty.
5. Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet, leaving him with 1 coin.
6. Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty.
7. Bob is left with 1 coin and removes it, making both wallets empty.
8. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Thus, the correct output for the test case `1 2` should be "Alice", not "Bob". Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Another example to consider:
```
1
2 1
```
The program would print "Bob" because the sum is 3 (odd). However, let's analyze the optimal moves:

1. Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
2. Alice swaps wallets, so now Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 2 coins.
3. Bob cannot swap wallets because Alice's wallet is already empty.
4. Bob removes 1 coin from his wallet, leaving him with 1 coin.
5. Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty.
6. Bob is left with 1 coin and removes it, making both wallets empty.
7. Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

Thus, the correct output for the test case `2 1` should be "Alice", not "Bob". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
