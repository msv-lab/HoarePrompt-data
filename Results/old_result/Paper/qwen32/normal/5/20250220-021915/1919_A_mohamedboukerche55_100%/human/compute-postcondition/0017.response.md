The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 5. The value of `t` remains the same as it is the upper bound of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the new string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting the new `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting the new `s` by whitespace; The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is 5**
