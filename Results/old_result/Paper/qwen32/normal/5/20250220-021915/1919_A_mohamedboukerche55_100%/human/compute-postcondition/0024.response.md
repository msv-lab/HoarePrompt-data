Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; all t test cases have been processed; for each test case, the program has read a string `s`, split it to get integers `a` and `b`, and printed 'Bob' if (a + b) is even, otherwise printed 'Alice'; i is equal to t.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the program will have processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, it will have read input values `a` and `b`, determined if their sum is even or odd, and printed 'Bob' for even sums and 'Alice' for odd sums. The loop variable `i` will have reached the value of `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
