The code snippet splits the string `s` into a list of substrings using whitespace as the delimiter, then takes the first element of this list, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.**
