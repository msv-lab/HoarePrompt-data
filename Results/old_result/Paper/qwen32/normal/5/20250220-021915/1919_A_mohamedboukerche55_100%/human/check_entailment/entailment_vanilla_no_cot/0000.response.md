To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic behind the game and compare it with the logic implemented in the program.

The game revolves around the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (a + b) in both wallets. The key observation is that if the total number of coins is even, Bob wins when both play optimally. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice wins when both play optimally.

Here is the reasoning:

1. **Total coins are Even (a + b is even):**
   - If the total number of coins is even, Alice and Bob can always make moves that keep the total number of coins even until one player has no coins left. Since Alice starts, Bob will always be the one to face a situation where there are no coins left to take, making Bob the winner.

2. **Total coins are Odd (a + b is odd):**
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make moves that keep the total number of coins odd until Bob faces a situation where there are no coins left to take. Since Alice starts, she will always be the one to make the last valid move, making Alice the winner.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the total number of coins and printing "Bob" if the total is even and "Alice" if the total is odd.

Thus, the program is correct based on the problem description.

Your response:
Correctness: **True**
