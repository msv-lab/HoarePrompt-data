### Reasoning:

The original assessment provides a sound analysis of the game mechanics and the optimal strategy based on the parity of the total number of coins (a + b). Here's a systematic evaluation using the annotated code to validate the original assessment:

1. **Game Mechanics and Optimal Play**:
   - The game involves two players taking turns, with the goal of making the opponent unable to make a move.
   - The players can choose to swap wallets or keep the current one, but they must always remove one coin from the current wallet.
   - The key insight is that the game's outcome depends on whether the total number of coins (a + b) is odd or even.

2. **Winning Strategy**:
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win because he can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice is eventually left with no valid move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of coins for Bob, putting Bob in a losing position.

3. **Program Analysis Using Annotations**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's (`a`) and Bob's (`b`) wallets.
   - It calculates the sum of coins (`a + b`).
   - It checks the parity of the sum:
     - If the sum is even (`(a + b) % 2 == 0`), it prints "Bob".
     - If the sum is odd (`(a + b) % 2 != 0`), it prints "Alice".

4. **Validation with Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the program correctly reads the input values and processes each test case.
   - The annotations also confirm that the program correctly prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy derived from the game mechanics and the annotations validate that the program behaves as expected for each test case. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
