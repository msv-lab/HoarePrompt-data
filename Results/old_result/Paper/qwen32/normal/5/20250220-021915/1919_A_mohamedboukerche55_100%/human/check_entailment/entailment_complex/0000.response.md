### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the game and the provided solution.

In this game, Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice going first. Each player can either swap their wallets or not, and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a move, i.e., when both wallets are empty.

The key to solving this problem is to realize that the game is symmetric and can be reduced to a simple parity check:

- If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will win.

This is because:
- If the total number of coins is even, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he will be left with an odd number of coins to play with after her optimal moves. Since Bob starts his turn with an odd number of coins, he will eventually be unable to make a move (since he will always leave an even number of coins for Alice, and eventually, he will face a situation where he has to play with 1 coin and Alice will take the last coin).
- Similarly, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he will be left with an even number of coins to play with after her optimal moves. Since Alice starts with an odd total, she can ensure that Bob will eventually face a situation where he cannot make a move.

The provided program correctly implements this logic by checking if the sum of coins (a + b) is even or odd and printing "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.
