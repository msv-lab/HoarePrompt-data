The code snippet provided takes the string `s`, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the integer value of the second element (index 1) to the variable `b`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `s` is the string input by the user.
- `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.

After executing the provided code, the output state is:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `s` remains the string input by the user.
- `a` remains the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.
- `b` is assigned the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.**
