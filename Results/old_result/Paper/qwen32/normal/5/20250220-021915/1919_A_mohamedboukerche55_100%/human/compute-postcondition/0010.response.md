The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is incremented by 1**.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, we adjust `i` accordingly.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is 4 (assuming `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration)**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we generalize it as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is incremented by 1**.

To be more precise in the context of the loop:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since we need to specify the exact state, we can denote the new value of `i` as `i_new` which is `i + 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is `i + 1`**.

For clarity, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is 4**.

Generalizing for any `i`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is `i + 1`**

Since we need a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 3:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is 4**.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is `i + 1`**

For a concrete example where `i` was 3:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace; `b` is the integer value of the second element of the list obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even; `i` is 4**
