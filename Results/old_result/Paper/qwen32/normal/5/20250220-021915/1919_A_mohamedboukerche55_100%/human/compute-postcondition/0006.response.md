The initial state describes several variables and their relationships, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'Bob'` and does not depend on the values of `t`, `s`, `a`, or `b`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
2. The variable `s` is a string input by the user.
3. The variable `a` is the integer value of the first element obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.
4. The variable `b` is the integer value of the second element obtained by splitting `s` by whitespace.
5. It is given that the sum of `a` and `b` is even.

However, the `print` statement:
```python
print('Bob')
```
simply outputs the string `'Bob'` regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, `a`, or `b`.

Therefore, based on the precondition and the code snippet, the output is:

Output: **Bob**
