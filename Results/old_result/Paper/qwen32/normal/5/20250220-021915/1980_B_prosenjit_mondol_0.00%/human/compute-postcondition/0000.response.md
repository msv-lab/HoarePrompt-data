The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which corresponds to the variable `t` in the provided state. The loop will run `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute, as the condition for the loop is already satisfied by the provided state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
