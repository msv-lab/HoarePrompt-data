To determine the output of the print statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the conditions in the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (This variable is not directly used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this analysis).
- `n` is the first integer read from input.
- `f` is the second integer read from input minus 1.
- `k` is the third integer read from input minus 1.
- `a` is a new list of integers read from input, sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the integer `a[f]` from the new list `a`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `k == n - 1`**
   - `k` is the third integer read from input minus 1.
   - `n` is the first integer read from input.
   - If `k` is equal to `n - 1`, it means `k` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.

2. **Condition 2: `a[k - 1] < x`**
   - `x` is the integer `a[f]` from the new list `a`.
   - `a[k - 1]` is the element at index `k - 1` in the list `a`.
   - This condition checks if the element at index `k - 1` is less than the element at index `f`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - If either `k == n - 1` or `a[k - 1] < x` is true, the print statement will output `'YES'`.
   - Otherwise, it will output `'MAYBE'`.

### Output:
The output of the print statement will be `'YES'` if `k` is the index of the last element in the list `a` or if the element at index `k - 1` is less than the element at index `f`. Otherwise, it will be `'MAYBE'`.

Output: **'YES' if `k == n - 1` or `a[k - 1] < x` else 'MAYBE' (where `k` is the third integer read from input minus 1, `n` is the first integer read from input, `x` is the integer `a[f]` from the new list `a` sorted in descending order, and `f` is the second integer read from input minus 1)**
