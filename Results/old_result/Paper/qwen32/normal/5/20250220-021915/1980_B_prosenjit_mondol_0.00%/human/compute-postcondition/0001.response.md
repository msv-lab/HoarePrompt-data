The provided code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three integers, which are then assigned to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers read from input.**
