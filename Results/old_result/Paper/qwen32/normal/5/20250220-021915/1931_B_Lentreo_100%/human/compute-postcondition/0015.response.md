Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean` and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1` and `curr` is now `curr + nums[i] - mean`. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return and `curr` remains updated.**
