The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `i` is `i + 1` and `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Let's summarize the adjustments:
- `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the last iteration plus 1.
- `n` remains the same, as it is the upper bound for the loop.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean` and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1` and `curr` is now `curr + nums[i] - mean`. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return and `curr` remains updated.**

Given the above, at the start of the next iteration:
State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean` and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is the value it was at the end of the last iteration plus 1.**

To be more specific, if `i` was 2 at the end of the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean` and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is 3.** 

(Note: The exact value of `i` will depend on its value at the end of the last iteration, but the principle is that `i` is incremented by 1.)
