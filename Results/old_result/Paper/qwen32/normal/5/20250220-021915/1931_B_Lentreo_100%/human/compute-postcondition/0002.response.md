Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` is the number of test cases (equal to the length of `nums`); `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`. The current value of `total` modulo `n` is not equal to 0.**
