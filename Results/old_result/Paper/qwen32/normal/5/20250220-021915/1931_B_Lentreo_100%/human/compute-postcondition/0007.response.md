The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `nums`, `total`, `mean`, and `curr` does not directly affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The value of `i` before the loop starts does not matter because it is initialized by the `range(n)` function in the loop head.

State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is 0**
