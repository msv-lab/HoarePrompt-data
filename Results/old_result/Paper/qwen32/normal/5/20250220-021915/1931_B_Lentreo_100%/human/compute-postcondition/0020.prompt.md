Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` is the number of test cases (equal to the length of `nums`); `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    curr += nums[i] - mean
    if curr < 0:
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean` and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean` and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1` and `curr` is now `curr + nums[i] - mean`. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program does not return and `curr` remains updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean` and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is `i + 1`. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues without returning anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
