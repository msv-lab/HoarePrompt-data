Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list represents a test case and contains `n+1` integers. The first integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) specifies the number of containers, and the following `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represent the amounts of water in the containers. The sum of `a_i` in each test case is divisible by `n`. The function returns 'YES' if a certain unspecified condition is met for the test case, otherwise it returns 'NO'.**
