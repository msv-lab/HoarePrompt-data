Let's carefully analyze the problem, the provided program, and the function summary to verify the correctness of the given program.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by transferring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`. The crucial point is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, `n`, which means there exists a target amount of water `mean = total_sum // n` that each container should ideally hold.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Water Divisibility**: The sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`, ensuring a valid `mean` value.
2. **Operation Constraints**: Water can only be transferred from a container with a smaller index to one with a larger index.
3. **Feasibility Check**: To check if the water can be balanced, we need to ensure that at no point do we end up with a negative amount of water when considering the running balance of water as we iterate through the containers.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program follows this logic:
- It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`mean`).
- It iterates through the list of containers, maintaining a running balance (`curr`) of water.
- If at any point the running balance (`curr`) becomes negative, it returns "NO", indicating that it's not possible to balance the water.
- If the loop completes without the running balance going negative, it returns "YES".

### Correctness:
Let's verify the logic step-by-step:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `total = sum(nums)`: This correctly computes the total amount of water.
   - `mean = total // n`: This correctly computes the target amount of water per container.
   
2. **Running Balance Check**:
   - `curr += nums[i] - mean`: This updates the running balance by subtracting the target amount from the current container's water.
   - `if curr < 0: return 'NO'`: This checks if at any point we have taken more water than is available from the containers we have processed so far. If `curr` becomes negative, it means we cannot balance the water as required.
   
3. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop completes without `curr` going negative, it means we can always transfer water in such a way that each container ends up with the target amount of water, and the program returns "YES".

### Testing with Examples:
Let's verify with the provided examples:
- **Example 1**: `nums = [43]`
  - `mean = 43`
  - `curr = 0 + 43 - 43 = 0`
  - No negative `curr`, so the output is "YES".
  
- **Example 2**: `nums = [1, 3]`
  - `mean = 2`
  - `curr = 0 + 1 - 2 = -1`
  - `curr` becomes negative, so the output is "NO".
  
- **Example 3**: `nums = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`
  - `mean = 3`
  - `curr = 0 + 4 - 3 = 1`
  - `curr = 1 + 5 - 3 = 3`
  - `curr = 3 + 2 - 3 = 2`
  - `curr = 2 + 1 - 3 = 0`
  - `curr = 0 + 3 - 3 = 0`
  - No negative `curr`, so the output is "YES".
  
- **Example 4**: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
  - `mean = 2`
  - `curr = 0 + 1 - 2 = -1`
  - `curr` becomes negative, so the output is "NO".
  
- **Example 5**: `nums = [4, 5, 5, 0, 6, 4, 4]`
  - `mean = 4`
  - `curr = 0 + 4 - 4 = 0`
  - `curr = 0 + 5 - 4 = 1`
  - `curr = 1 + 5 - 4 = 2`
  - `curr = 2 + 0 - 4 = -2`
  - `curr` becomes negative, so the output is "NO".
  
- **Example 6**: `nums = [6, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4]`
  - `mean = 4`
  - `curr = 0 + 6 - 4 = 2`
  - `curr = 2 + 5 - 4 = 3`
  - `curr = 3 + 5 - 4 = 4`
  - `curr = 4 + 1 - 4 = 1`
  - `curr = 1 + 3 - 4 = 0`
  - `curr = 0 + 4 - 4 = 0`
  - `curr = 0 + 4 - 4 = 0`
  - No negative `curr`, so the output is "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program logic correctly checks if it's possible to balance the water in the containers based on the running balance approach. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
