The code snippet `curr += nums[i] - mean` modifies the value of `curr` by adding the difference between the `i`-th inner list of `nums` and `mean` to it. The values of `nums`, `n`, `total`, and `mean` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` must be greater than 0; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is updated to `curr + nums[i] - mean`.**

In simple terms, the value of `curr` is adjusted by adding the difference between the `i`-th inner list of `nums` and the `mean`. Other variables like `nums`, `n`, `total`, and `mean` stay the same.
