To determine the final output state after the loop has completed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `curr`, `nums`, `n`, `total`, and `mean` are affected.

The loop iterates over each inner list in `nums`, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current inner list and the mean of all integers in all inner lists. If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes all iterations without `curr` going below 0, the function does not explicitly return anything, implying the function would end normally.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers.
- `n` is the number of test cases, which is the length of `nums`.
- `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists.
- `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`.
- `curr` is initialized to 0.

After each iteration:
- `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the current inner list and the mean.
- If `curr` is less than 0, the function returns 'NO'.

Since the problem states the output after the first 3 iterations and does not indicate that `curr` went below 0, we can infer that `curr` remained non-negative throughout these iterations.

Thus, after all `n` iterations, if `curr` has never been less than 0, the loop completes without returning 'NO'. The final state of `curr` will be the accumulated sum of the differences between each inner list and the mean.

**Output State:** `nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` is the number of test cases; `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is the accumulated sum of `nums[i] - mean` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.

In natural language: The final output state is that the loop has completed all iterations without `curr` going below 0. The variable `curr` holds the final accumulated sum of the differences between each inner list and the mean, and all other variables (`nums`, `n`, `total`, `mean`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
