The code snippet `n = len(nums)` assigns the length of the outer list `nums` (which represents the number of test cases) to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. The total number of test cases `t` is equal to the length of `nums`.

After executing the code, the variable `n` will hold the value `t`, which is the number of test cases. The other parts of the initial state, such as the structure of the inner lists and the constraints on the values within those lists, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` is the number of test cases (equal to the length of `nums`).**
