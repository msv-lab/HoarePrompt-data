The code snippet provided assigns the value `0` to the variable `curr`. None of the other variables (`nums`, `n`, `total`, `mean`) are modified by this assignment.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n+1 integers; `n` is the number of test cases (equal to the length of `nums`); `total` is the sum of all integers in all inner lists of `nums`; `mean` is the integer result of `total // n`; `curr` is 0.**
