Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the integer input, which represents the number of test cases. The constraints on `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state.
