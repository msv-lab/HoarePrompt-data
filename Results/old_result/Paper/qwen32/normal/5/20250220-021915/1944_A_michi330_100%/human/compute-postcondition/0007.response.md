Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is initialized by the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` satisfies `k >= n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` satisfies `k < n - 1`.**
