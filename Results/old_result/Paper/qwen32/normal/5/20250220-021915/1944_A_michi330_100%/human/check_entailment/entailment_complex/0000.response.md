Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys up to `k` bridges. The key insight is that Everule can always visit island 1, and the goal is to minimize the number of other islands that can be reached from island 1.

The program logic is as follows:
1. If `k >= n - 1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate island 1 from all other islands. This is because there are `n - 1` bridges directly connecting island 1 to the other islands, and destroying all of these bridges would mean Everule can only stay on island 1. Therefore, the output should be `1`.
2. If `k < n - 1`, Dominater cannot completely isolate island 1 from all other islands since there are still some bridges left that Everule can use to travel to other islands. In this case, the output should be `n`, meaning Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

The program correctly implements this logic by checking the condition `k >= n - 1` and printing `1` if true, otherwise printing `n`.

Correctness: **True**
