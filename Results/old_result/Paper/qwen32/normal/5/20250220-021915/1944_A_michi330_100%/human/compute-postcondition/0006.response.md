In the given initial state, `t` represents the number of test cases, `i` is initialized by the loop (implying it will iterate over each test case), `n` is the first integer from the input for each test case, and `k` is the second integer from the input for each test case, with the condition that `k` is less than `n - 1`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(n)
```

This statement will print the value of `n` for each iteration of the loop, which corresponds to the first integer input for each test case.

Since the exact values of `n` for each test case are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `n`.

Output: **n (where n is the first integer input for each test case)**
