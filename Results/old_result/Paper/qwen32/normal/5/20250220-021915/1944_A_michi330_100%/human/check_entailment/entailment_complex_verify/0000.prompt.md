You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. The input starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each containing a pair of integers n and k as described.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; i is equal to t, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations; n and k are the first and second integers from the last input, respectively. The loop has printed 1 if k >= n - 1, or n if k < n - 1, for each of the t test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise it prints `n`. This process is repeated for all `t` test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code against the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem states that there are initially `n` islands, and each pair of islands is connected by a bridge. Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can reach starting from island 1. The goal is to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

### Key Points

1. **Initial Setup**: Initially, all islands are connected, so Everule can visit all `n` islands.
2. **Bridge Destruction**: Dominater can destroy up to `k` bridges.
3. **Optimal Destruction**: Dominater should destroy bridges in such a way that the number of islands Everule can visit is minimized.
4. **Result**: For each test case, output the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater's optimal bridge destruction.

### Code Analysis

The provided code is as follows:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
```

#### Explanation of the Code

- **Loop through Test Cases**: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
- **Read Inputs**: For each test case, it reads the number of islands `n` and the number of bridges Dominater can destroy `k`.
- **Decision Logic**:
  - If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1`. This suggests that if Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, Everule can only visit island 1.
  - If `k < n - 1`, it prints `n`. This suggests that if Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands, Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

### Correctness Verification

- **Case 1**: `k >= n - 1`
  - If `k >= n - 1`, Dominater can destroy enough bridges to disconnect island 1 from all other islands. This is because to disconnect island 1 from all other islands, Dominater needs to destroy `n - 1` bridges (one to each of the other islands). Therefore, Everule can only visit island 1.
  - **Example**: For `n = 4` and `k = 4`, Dominater can destroy 4 bridges (one to each of the other 3 islands), so Everule can only visit island 1.
  - **Conclusion**: The code correctly handles this case.

- **Case 2**: `k < n - 1`
  - If `k < n - 1`, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands. Therefore, Everule can still visit all `n` islands.
  - **Example**: For `n = 4` and `k = 3`, Dominater can destroy 3 bridges, but island 1 will still be connected to at least one other island, so Everule can visit all 4 islands.
  - **Conclusion**: The code correctly handles this case.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears to correctly handle both cases as per the problem description. The code ensures that if Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands by destroying `n - 1` bridges, Everule can only visit island 1. Otherwise, Everule can visit all `n` islands.
