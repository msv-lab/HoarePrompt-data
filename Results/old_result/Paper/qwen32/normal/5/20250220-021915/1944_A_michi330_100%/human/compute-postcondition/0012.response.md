Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. `i` is an integer that has been incremented by 1. `n` is the first integer from the new input, and `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` satisfies `k >= n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` satisfies `k < n - 1`.**
