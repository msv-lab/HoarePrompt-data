The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This means that the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the input provided.

Given the initial state, `n` and `k` were previously defined. After executing the code snippet, `n` and `k` will now hold the values provided by the input, and the conditions related to `k` and `n` will need to be re-evaluated based on these new values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is initialized by the loop and is now `i + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `k` satisfies `k >= n - 1`. Otherwise, `k` satisfies `k < n - 1`.**
