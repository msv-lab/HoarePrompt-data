Reasoning:
To determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes `s1` into the desired state `s2`, the program calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). 

The key observation is that moving a cat from one box to another can be broken down into two operations: removing a cat from one box and adding a cat to another box. Therefore, the number of days required to achieve the desired state is determined by the larger of the two counts: adding cats or removing cats. This is because you can only perform one operation per day, and the limiting factor will be the operation that requires more instances.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:
1. Count the number of positions where a cat needs to be added (`s1[i] == '0'` and `s2[i] == '1'`).
2. Count the number of positions where a cat needs to be removed (`s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`).
3. The minimum number of days required is the maximum of these two counts, as the more frequent operation (either adding or removing) will determine the total number of days needed.

The provided program correctly implements this logic in the `func_1` function and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
