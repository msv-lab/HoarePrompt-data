### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). The allowed operations are adding a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another.

The key insight to solving this problem is recognizing that:
- The number of cats to add (`cats_to_add`) is the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1'.
- The number of cats to remove (`cats_to_remove`) is the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'.

The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. This is because:
- If `cats_to_add` is greater, you need to add enough cats to cover all the '1's in `s2` that are not in `s1`. During this process, if there are extra cats in boxes that should be removed (i.e., where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'), you can remove them while adding the necessary cats.
- If `cats_to_remove` is greater, you need to remove enough cats to match the '0's in `s2` that are '1's in `s1`. During this process, if there are positions that need cats (i.e., where `s2` has '1' and `s1` has '0'), you can add them while removing the extra cats.

Thus, the function correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required.
