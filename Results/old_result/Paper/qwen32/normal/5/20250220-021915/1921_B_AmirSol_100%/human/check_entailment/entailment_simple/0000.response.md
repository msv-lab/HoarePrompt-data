### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` to the desired state `s2`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Counting Cats to Add (`cats_to_add`)**: This variable counts the number of boxes in the final state (`s2`) that are supposed to have a cat (`'1'`) but currently do not have one in the initial state (`s1`).

2. **Counting Cats to Remove (`cats_to_remove`)**: This variable counts the number of boxes in the initial state (`s1`) that have a cat (`'1'`) but should not have one in the final state (`s2`).

3. **Returning the Maximum**: The function returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. This is because the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` to `s2` is determined by the larger of the two counts. If we need to add more cats than we need to remove, the number of days is determined by the number of cats we need to add. Conversely, if we need to remove more cats than we need to add, the number of days is determined by the number of cats we need to remove. 

   - **Explanation of Maximum**: Suppose `cats_to_add = 3` and `cats_to_remove = 2`. We need to add 3 cats and can remove 2 cats in parallel, but the total operations still need to account for the 3 additions. Thus, the minimum number of days is 3.

4. **Correctness of the Approach**: The approach leverages the fact that the operations (add, remove, move) can be performed in parallel, but the overall number of operations is bounded by the larger of the two counts (`cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`). This is because any move operation can be considered as a combination of a remove and an add operation, and thus, the limiting factor is the operation that needs to be performed more frequently.

### Conclusion:

The logic in the `func_1` function correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` to the desired state `s2`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
