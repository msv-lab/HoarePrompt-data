The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is divided by 2 using integer division. Since `x` was initially an even integer not equal to 1, after the operation, `x` will still be an integer and will be half of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1 and `x` is even (specifically, `x` is now half of its initial value), `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `t` is 0, `i` is 2.**
