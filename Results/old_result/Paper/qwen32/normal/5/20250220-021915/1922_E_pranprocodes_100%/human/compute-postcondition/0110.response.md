Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 0 or 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is odd, `min` is -99999998 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999997 if `x` is odd, `ans` is [100000000, 99999999, -99999999] if `x` is even, `ans` is [100000000, -99999999, -99999998] if `x` is odd, or `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000, -99999998] if `x` is 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 3**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `x` has been decremented by 1, so it is no longer equal to 1 (and still not equal to 0). The values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged.
