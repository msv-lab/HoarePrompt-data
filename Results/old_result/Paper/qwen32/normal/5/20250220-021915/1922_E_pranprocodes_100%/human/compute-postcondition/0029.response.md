Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1 and is now `x // 2`; `max` is 99999997 if `x` was originally even, and 99999999 if `x` was originally odd; `min` is -100000000 if `x` was originally even, and -99999999 if `x` was originally odd; `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000, 99999999, and `max`; `t` is 2.**

Natural Language: The value of `x` has been updated to `x // 2`, which means it is now half of its original value (integer division). The values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.
