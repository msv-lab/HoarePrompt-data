Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999997 if `x` was even, and 99999999 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even and `x` was originally even, -99999999 if `x` was odd or `x` was originally odd, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000, 99999999, and `max`, `t` is 2**.

In simpler terms, the value of `max` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
