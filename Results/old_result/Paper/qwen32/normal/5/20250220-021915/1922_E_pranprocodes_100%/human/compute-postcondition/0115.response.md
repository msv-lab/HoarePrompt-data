The initial state provides us with the values of several variables: `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`, and `i`. However, the `print` statement only involves the variable `t`.

Given that `t` is explicitly set to 3 in the initial state, the `print(t)` statement will output the value of `t`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state specifies that `t` is 3.
2. The `print(t)` statement directly prints the value of `t`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `t`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
