Output State: **`x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000 and 99999999 if `x` is even, `ans` is a list containing the value -100000000 and 99999999 if `x` is odd, and `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to be `x // 2`, which means `x` is now the integer division of its previous value by 2. The values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.
