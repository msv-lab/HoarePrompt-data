The code snippet `ans.append(min)` appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `min` is either `-100000000` if `x` is even or `-99999999` if `x` is odd. Therefore, the list `ans` will now contain two elements: the initial value and the newly appended `min` value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer input value that is greater than 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, `max` is 100000000 if `x` is odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is odd, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000 and `min` if `x` is even, `ans` is a list containing the value -100000000 and `min` if `x` is odd, and `t` is 1.**
