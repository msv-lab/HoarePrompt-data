The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer not equal to 1, which means the loop can certainly execute one more time without any adjustment to `x`.

Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000], `t` is 1, `i` is 3**
