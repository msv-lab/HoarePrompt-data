Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is now half of its initial value, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999]` or `[100000000, 99999998]`, `t` is 1, `i` is 2. If `x` is odd, `x` remains unchanged, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999 or -99999998, `ans` is `[100000000, -100000000]` or `[-100000000, -99999999]`, `t` is 1, `i` is 2.**
