The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `min` is either -99999999 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd. Since `ans` was initially [100000000] if `x` is even or [-100000000] if `x` is odd, after appending `min`, `ans` will be [100000000, -99999999] if `x` is even, or [-100000000, -100000000] if `x` is odd.

Output State: **`x` is an integer not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000, -99999999] if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is [-100000000, -100000000], `t` is 1, `i` is 3**
