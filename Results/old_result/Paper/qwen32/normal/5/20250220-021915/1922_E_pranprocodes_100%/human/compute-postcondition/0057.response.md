The code snippet `ans.append(max)` adds the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Based on the initial state, `max` has two possible values depending on whether `x` is even or not. 

If `x` is even, `max` is 99999999, and if `x` is not divisible by 2, `max` is 100000000. The list `ans` initially contains either `[100000000]` or `[-100000000]` depending on the same condition. After appending `max` to `ans`, the list `ans` will have two elements: the initial value and `max`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is now half of its initial value, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is `[100000000, 99999999]`, `t` is 1, `i` is 2. Otherwise, `x` is not divisible by 2, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is `[-100000000, 100000000]`, `t` is 1, `i` is 2.**
