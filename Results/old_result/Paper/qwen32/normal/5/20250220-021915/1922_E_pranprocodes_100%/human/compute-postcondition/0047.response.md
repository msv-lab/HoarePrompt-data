The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. The other variables (`x`, `min`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Since `max` is 100000000, `ans` now contains this value.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1 and `x` is even, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [100000000], `t` is 0, `i` is 2**.
