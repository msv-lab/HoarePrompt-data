To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. The provided code snippet includes input handling functions but does not contain the actual logic for solving the problem. Therefore, we cannot determine the correctness of the program based on the given code alone.

The problem requires implementing a solution where the permutation is manipulated by performing up to two swaps to ensure that after applying a binary search, the element at the index `l` is equal to `x`. The binary search algorithm is provided in the problem statement, and the solution must ensure that the binary search ends with `p_l` equal to `x`.

However, the provided code does not contain the logic for performing the swaps or for the binary search. It only defines functions for reading input.

### Steps for a Correct Solution:
1. **Input Reading**: The program must read multiple test cases, each with a permutation and a target number `x`.
2. **Swapping Logic**: For each test case, the program must determine up to two swaps that will make `p_l` equal to `x` after the binary search.
3. **Binary Search Simulation**: The program must simulate the binary search to verify that after the swaps, `p_l` is indeed equal to `x`.
4. **Output**: The program must output the number of swaps performed and the indices of the elements swapped.

### Analysis of Provided Code:
- The provided code includes functions for reading input but does not implement the logic for solving the problem.
- The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are defined to read different types of input, but they are not used in the provided snippet.
- There is no logic for performing the swaps or simulating the binary search.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code does not contain the logic to solve the problem, it cannot be considered correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
