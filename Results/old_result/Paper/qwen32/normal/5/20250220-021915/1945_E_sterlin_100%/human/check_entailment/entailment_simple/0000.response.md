### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem as described. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly implements the solution:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the permutation) and `x` (the number to be found).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

2. **Index Mapping:**
   - A dictionary `num_indx` is created to map each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).

3. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are initialized to 0 and `n` respectively.
   - A `seen` list is initialized to keep track of the elements that have been encountered during the binary search.

4. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - The binary search loop continues until `right - left = 1`.
   - During each iteration, the middle index `mid` is calculated.
   - The element at `mid` is marked as seen.
   - Depending on whether the element at `mid` is less than or equal to `x`, either `left` or `right` is updated.

5. **Result Determination:**
   - If the element at `left` is equal to `x`, no swaps are needed (`k = 0`).
   - If `x` has not been seen during the binary search, one swap is sufficient to place `x` at the correct position (`k = 1`).
   - If `x` has been seen but is not at the correct position, two swaps are performed to place `x` at the correct position (`k = 2`).

### Verification of Execution States:

Let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `6 3`, `1 2 3 4 5 6`
  - The permutation is already sorted, so no swaps are needed. The binary search correctly finds `x` at index 2 (0-based), which is `3`.
  - Output: `0`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `6 5`, `3 1 6 5 2 4`
  - The binary search will not find `5` at the correct position initially. One swap is needed to place `5` at the correct position.
  - Output: `1`
  - Swap: `3 4` (swaps elements at indices 2 and 3, making the permutation `3 5 6 1 2 4`)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `5 1`, `3 5 4 2 1`
  - The binary search will not find `1` at the correct position initially. Two swaps are needed to place `1` at the correct position.
  - Output: `2`
  - Swaps: `2 4`, `1 5` (swaps elements at indices 1 and 3, then 0 and 4, making the permutation `1 5 4 2 3`)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `6 3`, `4 3 1 5 2 6`
  - The binary search will not find `3` at the correct position initially. Two swaps are needed to place `3` at the correct position.
  - Output: `2`
  - Swaps: `4 5`, `1 5` (swaps elements at indices 3 and 4, then 0 and 4, making the permutation `3 5 1 4 2 6`)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `3 2`, `3 2 1`
  - The binary search will not find `2` at the correct position initially. One swap is needed to place `2` at the correct position.
  - Output: `1`
  - Swap: `1 3` (swaps elements at indices 0 and 2, making the permutation `1 2 3`)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution, ensuring that the binary search can find `x` in the permutation after at most two swaps. All test cases are handled as expected.

**Correctness: True**
