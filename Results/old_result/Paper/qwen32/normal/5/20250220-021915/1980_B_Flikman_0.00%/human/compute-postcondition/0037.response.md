Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `same_value_count` is the total number of times `favorite_value` appears in the list `a`, and `greater_count` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`. If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program proceeds as per the if part. Otherwise, `greater_count` is less than `k`. If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, the program proceeds as per the if part. Otherwise, `greater_count + same_value_count` is greater than `k`.**
