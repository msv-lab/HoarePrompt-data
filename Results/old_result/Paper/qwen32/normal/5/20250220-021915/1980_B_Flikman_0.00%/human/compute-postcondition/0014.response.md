The code snippet `same_value_count += 1` increments the value of `same_value_count` by 1. Given the initial state, `same_value_count` is either 1 or 2. After the increment, if `same_value_count` was initially 1, it becomes 2; if it was initially 2, it becomes 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 and `a` must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is initially 2; otherwise, `same_value_count` is initially 1. `value` is the third element in the list `a`. After the code execution, `same_value_count` is either 2 or 3.**
