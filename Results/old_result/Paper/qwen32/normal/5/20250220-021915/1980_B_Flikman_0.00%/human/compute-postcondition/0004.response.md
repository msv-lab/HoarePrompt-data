`favorite_value` is assigned the value of the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and the elements of `a` that are not at index `f - 1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, and `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`**.
