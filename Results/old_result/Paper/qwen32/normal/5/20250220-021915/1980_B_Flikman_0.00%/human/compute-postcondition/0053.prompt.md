Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]` (with respect to the new list `a`), `same_value_count` is 0, `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `_` is incremented by 1
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and `_` is incremented by 1. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is 2. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and `_` is incremented by 1. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is set to 1. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 0. `value` is the next element in the list `a` that has not yet been processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `f` is the second integer from the new input, `k` is the third integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `greater_count` is the total number of elements in the new list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, and `_` is incremented by 1. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 0. `value` is the next element in the list `a` that has not yet been processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
