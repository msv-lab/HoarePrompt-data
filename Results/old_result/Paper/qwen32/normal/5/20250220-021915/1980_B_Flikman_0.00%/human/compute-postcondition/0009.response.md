Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 and `a` must have at least 1 element, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is 1; otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 0.**
