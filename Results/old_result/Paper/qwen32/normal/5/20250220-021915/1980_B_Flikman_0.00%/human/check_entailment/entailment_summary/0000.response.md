### Reasoning:

The program's logic is based on the following key points:
1. **Identify the favorite cube's value**: The program correctly identifies the value of the favorite cube by accessing `a[f - 1]` since the list is 0-indexed.
2. **Count cubes with the same value**: It counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube.
3. **Count cubes with greater values**: It counts how many cubes have values greater than the favorite cube.
4. **Determine the outcome**:
   - If the number of cubes with greater values (`greater_count`) is at least `k`, the favorite cube will always be removed, so it prints 'YES'.
   - If the sum of cubes with greater values and cubes with the same value is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will never be removed, so it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE', meaning the favorite cube may or may not be removed depending on the specific arrangement of cubes with the same value.

The logic aligns with the problem requirements and handles all the cases described in the problem statement:
- If there are enough cubes with greater values, the favorite cube will always be removed.
- If there are not enough cubes with greater values and the total of cubes with greater and equal values is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will never be removed.
- Otherwise, it's uncertain whether the favorite cube will be removed or not.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic described above and handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
