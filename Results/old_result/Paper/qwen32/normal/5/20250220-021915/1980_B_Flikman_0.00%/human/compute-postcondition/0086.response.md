Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements. `n`, `f`, `k`, `greater_count`, and `t` remain unchanged. `favorite_value` remains unchanged. If the current value of `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.**
