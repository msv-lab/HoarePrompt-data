Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first integer from the input, `f` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the third integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 and `a` must have at least 2 elements, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is 2; otherwise, `same_value_count` is 1, `value` is the second element in the list `a`.**
