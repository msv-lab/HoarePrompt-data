Output State: **`c` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(c) <= 18 and 0 <= c[i] <= 10^7 for all i in the range of the length of c; `m` is 0.**

Natural Language: The list `c` remains unchanged, still containing integers where the length of `c` is between 1 and 18, and each element in `c` is between 0 and 10^7. The variable `m` is initialized to 0.
