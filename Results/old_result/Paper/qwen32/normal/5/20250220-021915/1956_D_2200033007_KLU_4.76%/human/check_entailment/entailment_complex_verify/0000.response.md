### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues systematically using the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations:

1. **Handling of Input Data:**
   - The program reads the input but converts the array elements to strings (`a.append(ai)`). This will cause issues when performing arithmetic operations, as the program needs to work with integer values.
   - The annotations correctly point out that the array `a` is being populated with string values instead of integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is only handling two specific cases:
     - When the length of the array is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
     - For any other length, it prints `13 0`.
   - This approach is insufficient and incorrect for the problem at hand. The function does not compute the MEX value for any subarray and does not perform any operations to maximize the sum.
   - The annotations confirm that the function does not compute the MEX value or perform any operations to maximize the sum.

3. **Generalization to All Cases:**
   - The function does not handle all possible lengths of the array correctly. For example, it incorrectly outputs `13 0` for all arrays with a length other than 2, which is not always the correct maximum sum.
   - The annotations mention that the function does not handle all possible lengths of the array correctly.

4. **Example Test Case:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
     - The program will output:
       ```
       13 0
       ```
     - However, the correct output should be:
       ```
       12 2
       1 4
       1 4
       ```
     - The MEX of the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is `0`, and setting the entire array to `0` would not maximize the sum. Instead, the MEX of the array is `0`, and the optimal strategy involves setting subarrays to their respective MEX values that maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the allowed operations. It only handles specific cases and does not generalize to all possible inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
