In the given task, the initial state describes the list `c` and the variable `m`. However, the `print` statement is a formatted string that does not reference these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'4 1'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `c` is a list containing a single element, 2, and `m` is 0.
2. The `print` statement is `print(f'4 1')`.
3. The `f` in front of the string indicates that it is an f-string, which allows for embedding expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`. However, in this case, there are no expressions inside the curly braces.
4. Therefore, the string `'4 1'` is printed as is, without any modifications based on the values of `c` or `m`.

Output: **4 1**
