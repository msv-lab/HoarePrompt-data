The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` must have been greater than 0, but we need to ensure it is still greater than 0 for the next iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `num_tests` to be greater than 0. Since we don't know the exact value of `num_tests` at the end of the previous iteration, we can simply state that `num_tests` must be greater than 0 for the loop to proceed.

State: **`start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the `nums` list, `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
