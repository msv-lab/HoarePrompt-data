Reasoning:
The original assessment appears to be accurate. Let's break down the code and function summary to ensure that the program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap:
The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given that signs occur in a sequential manner with specific periodicities. The i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years, and the tribe waits for the (i+1)-th sign to occur strictly after the i-th sign.

### Provided Solution:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (Test Cases)**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases (`num_tests`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their respective periodicities (`nums`).

2. **Inner Loop (Processing Each Sign)**:
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each sign, the program calculates the year the sign will occur.
   - The calculation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next occurrence of the sign after `start_year`.
     - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of full cycles of `nums[x]` years that have passed up to `start_year`.
     - Adding 1 ensures the tribe waits for the next occurrence strictly after `start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` then gives the year of the next occurrence.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the `start_year`, which is the year the n-th sign occurs.

### Verification with Example:
Let's verify the program with the provided example:

For the first test case:
- `n = 6`
- `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
- Initial `start_year = 0`
- Iteration:
  - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
  - Second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
  - Third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
  - Fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
  - Fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
  - Sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`

The result matches the expected output of 36.

### Function Summary:
The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases and calculates and prints the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of integers provided as input. However, the function is not actually calculating the LCM but rather determining the next occurrence of each sign in sequence, as described in the program's logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case based on the given periodicities and the sequential requirement. The function summary is misleading in this context, but the code itself is correct.

Final: **True**
