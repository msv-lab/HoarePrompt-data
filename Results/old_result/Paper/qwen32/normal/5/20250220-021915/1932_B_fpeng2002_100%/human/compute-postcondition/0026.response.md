To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `start_year` is defined as the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the elements in the list `nums`.
   - `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.

2. **Relevant Information:**
   - The `print(start_year)` statement will output the value of `start_year`.
   - `start_year` is explicitly stated to be the LCM of the elements in the list `nums`.

3. **What is printed:**
   - Since `start_year` is the LCM of the elements in `nums`, the print statement will output the LCM of the integers in the `nums` list.

Given the above reasoning, the output will be the LCM of the integers in the list `nums`.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the elements in the list `nums`)**
