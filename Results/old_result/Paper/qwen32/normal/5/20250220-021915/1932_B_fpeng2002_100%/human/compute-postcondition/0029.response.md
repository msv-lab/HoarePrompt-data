The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is already an input integer, but the code reassigns `n` with a new input value. The other variables (`start_year`, `num_tests`, and `nums`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`start_year` is LCM(nums), `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input**.

In natural language: The value of `n` has been updated to a new input integer, while `start_year`, `num_tests`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
