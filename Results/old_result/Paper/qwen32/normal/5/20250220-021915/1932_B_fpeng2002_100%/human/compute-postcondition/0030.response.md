The code snippet updates the `nums` list by reading a new set of integers from the input. The `start_year` and `num_tests` variables remain unchanged. The `n` variable, which is an input integer, is also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`start_year` is LCM(nums), `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input**.

In simpler terms, the `nums` list is now updated with new integers from the input, while `start_year`, `num_tests`, and `n` retain their original values.
