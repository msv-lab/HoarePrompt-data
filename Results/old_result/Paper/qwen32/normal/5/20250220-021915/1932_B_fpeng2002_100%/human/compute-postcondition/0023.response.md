The only variables in the loop head are `x` and the range `0, len(nums)`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` and the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `x + 1` and must be less than `len(nums)` for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be one less than its value at the start of the next iteration, and it must still be less than `len(nums)`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`start_year` is `((0 // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1]`, `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 integer, `x` is `x`**
