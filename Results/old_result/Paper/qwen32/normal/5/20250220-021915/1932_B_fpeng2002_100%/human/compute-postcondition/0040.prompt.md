Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a list of `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `num_tests` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: start_year is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the nums list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: start_year is LCM(nums), num_tests is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0, n is an input integer, nums is a list of integers read from the input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers in `nums`, `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
