The code snippet provided updates the `nums` list by reading a new set of space-separated integers from the input. This means the `nums` list will now contain these new integers. The values of `start_year` and `num_tests` are not affected by this code snippet, and `n` remains an input integer.

Output State: **`start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers in the `nums` list, `num_tests` is one less than its previous value and must still be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers read from the input.**
