Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
A password is considered strong if:
1. It consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. No digit comes after a letter.
3. All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads multiple test cases and checks each password using the function `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**:
   - The function first separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   
2. **Check for Digits Following Letters**:
   - It then iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. It does this by keeping track of the last index of a digit (`last_digit_index`). If a letter is encountered after a digit, it immediately returns "NO".

3. **Check Sorted Order**:
   - The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If either list is not sorted, it returns "NO".

4. **Return "YES"**:
   - If none of the above conditions are violated, the function returns "YES".

### Function Summary
The function summary states that `func_1` checks if the input string `password` consists of digits followed by letters, with both digits and letters in ascending order. It returns 'NO' if any of the conditions are violated, otherwise 'YES'.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the password consists solely of letters or solely of digits correctly. It suggests that the program should explicitly check if the password is composed only of digits or only of letters and return "YES" in such cases.

### Reasoning

The original assessment is **incorrect**. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Handling of Only Letters or Only Digits**:
   - The function `func_1` does **not** require the presence of both digits and letters to return "YES". 
   - If the password consists only of digits, the `letters` list will be empty, and the check `if letters and letters != sorted(letters)` will not be executed because `letters` is empty.
   - Similarly, if the password consists only of letters, the `digits` list will be empty, and the check `if digits and digits != sorted(digits)` will not be executed because `digits` is empty.
   - In both cases, the function will check the sorted condition for the non-empty list and return "YES" if the condition is satisfied.

2. **Edge Case Examples**:
   - For a password consisting only of digits, e.g., "12345":
     - `digits = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`
     - `letters = []`
     - The function checks `if digits != sorted(digits)` which is `False` because `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']` is sorted.
     - No letter is encountered, so `last_digit_index` remains `-1`, and no "NO" is returned.
     - The function returns "YES".
   - For a password consisting only of letters, e.g., "abcde":
     - `digits = []`
     - `letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']`
     - The function checks `if letters != sorted(letters)` which is `False` because `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']` is sorted.
     - No digit is encountered, so `last_digit_index` remains `-1`, and no "NO" is returned.
     - The function returns "YES".

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly claims that the program does not handle passwords consisting solely of digits or solely of letters correctly. The provided program correctly handles these cases and adheres to the problem description.

**Final: True**
