You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Password Composition**: Only lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Ordering Constraint**: No digit can appear after a letter.
3. **Sorting Constraint**: All digits, if present, must be in non-decreasing order.
4. **Sorting Constraint**: All letters, if present, must be in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
    - The first element in this list is the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Password Validation**:
    - For each password, the program uses the `func_1` function to determine if the password is strong.
    - `func_1` separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
    - It then checks if there is any digit that appears after a letter by keeping track of the last index of a digit (`last_digit_index`). If a letter is encountered after a digit, the password is immediately marked as "NO".
    - It then checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order and if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, the password is marked as "NO".
    - If all checks are passed, the password is marked as "YES".

### Correctness Verification:
- **Ordering Constraint Check**: The program correctly tracks the last index of a digit and ensures no letter appears after a digit, which satisfies the second condition.
- **Sorting Constraint Check**: The program correctly checks that both the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order, which satisfies the third and fourth conditions.
- **Input Parsing**: The input parsing correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the necessary data for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong according to the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
