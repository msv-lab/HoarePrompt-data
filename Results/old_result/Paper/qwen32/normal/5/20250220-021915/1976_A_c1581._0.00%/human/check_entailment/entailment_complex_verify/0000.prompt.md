You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20.

    #State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20. `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the `password` string in the order they appear.

    #State: The function either returns 'NO' if a non-digit appears after a digit, or completes the loop with `last_digit_index` set to the index of the last digit or -1 if no digits are present.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The function either returns 'NO' if a non-digit appears after a digit, or completes the loop with `last_digit_index` set to the index of the last digit or -1 if no digits are present. Additionally, the list `digits` is sorted.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The function either returns 'NO' if a non-digit appears after a digit, or completes the loop with `last_digit_index` set to the index of the last digit or -1 if no digits are present. Additionally, the list `digits` is sorted. The list `letters` is sorted.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function checks if the input string `password` consists of digits followed by letters, with both digits and letters in ascending order. If any of the conditions are violated, it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw that causes it to incorrectly determine the strength of certain passwords. Specifically, it does not correctly handle passwords that contain only letters or only digits.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Handling of Only Letters or Only Digits**: The program separates the password into digits and letters and checks if each list is sorted. However, it does not handle the case where the password consists solely of letters or solely of digits correctly. The program should still return "YES" for such passwords, but the current implementation relies on the presence of both digits and letters to make a determination.

2. **Edge Case Example**:
   - Consider a password consisting only of digits, e.g., "12345". This password is strong because all digits are in non-decreasing order, and there are no letters to violate the conditions.
   - The program will correctly identify that the digits are sorted, but it will not explicitly check if the password is composed only of digits and return "YES". Instead, it will implicitly rely on the presence of letters to make a determination, which does not exist in this case.

3. **Another Edge Case Example**:
   - Consider a password consisting only of letters, e.g., "abcde". This password is strong because all letters are in non-decreasing order, and there are no digits to violate the conditions.
   - Similar to the previous case, the program will correctly identify that the letters are sorted, but it will not explicitly check if the password is composed only of letters and return "YES". Instead, it will implicitly rely on the presence of digits to make a determination, which does not exist in this case.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if the password is composed only of digits or only of letters and return "YES" in such cases.

Here's a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits and digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters and letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

In this corrected version, the program checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are non-empty before checking if they are sorted, ensuring that passwords consisting only of digits or only of letters are correctly identified as strong.
