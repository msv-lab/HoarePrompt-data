Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw that causes it to incorrectly determine the strength of certain passwords. Specifically, it does not correctly handle passwords that contain only letters or only digits.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Handling of Only Letters or Only Digits**: The program separates the password into digits and letters and checks if each list is sorted. However, it does not handle the case where the password consists solely of letters or solely of digits correctly. The program should still return "YES" for such passwords, but the current implementation relies on the presence of both digits and letters to make a determination.

2. **Edge Case Example**:
   - Consider a password consisting only of digits, e.g., "12345". This password is strong because all digits are in non-decreasing order, and there are no letters to violate the conditions.
   - The program will correctly identify that the digits are sorted, but it will not explicitly check if the password is composed only of digits and return "YES". Instead, it will implicitly rely on the presence of letters to make a determination, which does not exist in this case.

3. **Another Edge Case Example**:
   - Consider a password consisting only of letters, e.g., "abcde". This password is strong because all letters are in non-decreasing order, and there are no digits to violate the conditions.
   - Similar to the previous case, the program will correctly identify that the letters are sorted, but it will not explicitly check if the password is composed only of letters and return "YES". Instead, it will implicitly rely on the presence of digits to make a determination, which does not exist in this case.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if the password is composed only of digits or only of letters and return "YES" in such cases.

Here's a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits and digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters and letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

In this corrected version, the program checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are non-empty before checking if they are sorted, ensuring that passwords consisting only of digits or only of letters are correctly identified as strong.
