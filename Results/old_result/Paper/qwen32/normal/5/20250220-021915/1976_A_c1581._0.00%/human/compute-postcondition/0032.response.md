The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `last_digit_index`. Given that `i` is 2, `last_digit_index` will be set to 2. The other variables (`password`, `n`, and `char`) remain unchanged. The condition that checks if `char` is a digit and the subsequent return statement are not executed because the assignment is the only statement provided.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters where `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character of `password`, `last_digit_index` is 2.**
