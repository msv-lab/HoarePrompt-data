Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to ensure it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Password Composition**: Only lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. **Ordering Constraint**: No digit can appear after a letter.
3. **Sorting Constraint**: All digits, if present, must be in non-decreasing order.
4. **Sorting Constraint**: All letters, if present, must be in non-decreasing order.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
    - The first element is the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password string itself.

2. **Password Validation**:
    - The `func_1` function is used to determine if the password is strong.
    - `func_1` separates the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
    - It then checks if there is any digit that appears after a letter by keeping track of the last index of a digit (`last_digit_index`). If a letter is encountered after a digit, the password is immediately marked as "NO".
    - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order and if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, the password is marked as "NO".
    - If all checks are passed, the password is marked as "YES".

### Function Summary:
The function checks if the input string `password` consists of digits followed by letters, with both digits and letters in ascending order. If any of the conditions are violated, it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Ordering Constraint Check**: The program correctly tracks the last index of a digit and ensures no letter appears after a digit, which satisfies the second condition.
- **Sorting Constraint Check**: The program correctly checks that both the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order, which satisfies the third and fourth conditions.
- **Input Parsing**: The input parsing correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the necessary data for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a password is strong according to the given conditions. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`, and the program's logic aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
