The code snippet assigns the value of `y` to `max_val`. This action does not affect the conditions or the values of `x`, `y`, or `y_end` directly. Since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet, the program does not terminate, and `max_val` is updated to the current value of `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer such that `3 <= x <= 1000`, `y` is `y_end - 2`, and `y_end` is the value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration. `max_val` is now equal to `y`. If `2 * y >= x`, the program returns `y`. Otherwise, no return occurs, and `max_val` remains unchanged.**
