Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` such that 2 <= x <= 1000. It returns the largest integer `y` that divides `x` perfectly and satisfies `2 * y >= x`. If no such `y` exists, it returns `y_end - 1`, where `y_end` is the value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration. If `y_end - 1` also does not satisfy the condition, it returns `y_end - 2`. If none of these conditions are met, it returns `max_val`, which is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x / 2`.**
