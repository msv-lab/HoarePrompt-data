To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `y` and `x`. The loop iterates with `y` starting from `x - 1` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 2. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is an integer such that `3 <= x <= 1000`.
- `max_val` is `y` if `x` is divisible by `y` and `2 * y < x`; otherwise, `max_val` remains 1.

The loop head is:
```
for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
```

At the end of the previous iteration, `y` has some value, say `y_end`. For the loop to execute one more time, `y_end` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `y_end - 1`.

Let's denote the value of `y` at the start of the next iteration as `y_start`. Thus, `y_start = y_end - 1`.

Since `y` is the only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration, and `x` remains constant throughout the loop, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `x` remains the same.
- `y` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`x` is an integer such that `3 <= x <= 1000`, `y` is `y_end - 1` where `y_end` is the value of `y` at the end of the previous iteration**.
