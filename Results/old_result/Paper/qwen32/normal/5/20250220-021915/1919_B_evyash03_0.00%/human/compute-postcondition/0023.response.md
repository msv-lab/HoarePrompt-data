The code snippet `balance += 1` increments the value of the variable `balance` by 1. The initial state provides conditions for `balance` and `count` based on the value of `balance`. If `balance` was less than 0 before the increment, `count` is set to 0 and `balance` is set to 0. If `balance` was not less than 0, then `count` and `balance` retain their original values. Since the code increments `balance`, the condition `balance < 0` would no longer be true after the increment, so `count` and `balance` will retain their values unless `balance` was -1 initially.

Given the initial state and the operation performed, the output state will be:

If `balance` was initially less than 0, after `balance += 1`, `balance` will be 0 and `count` will be 0.
If `balance` was initially 0 or greater, after `balance += 1`, `balance` will be `balance + 1` and `count` will retain its original value.

Output State: **`expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `char` is the next character in `expression`. If `balance` was less than 0, then `count` is 0 and `balance` is 0; otherwise, `count` retains its original value and `balance` is `balance + 1`.**
