### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding

The task is to split the given string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. The optimal strategy involves splitting the array in such a way that the subarrays have a sum of zero, as this would minimize their penalties.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Initial Splitting Attempt:**
   - The program attempts to split the string `s` using the `split('-')` method. This method splits the string at every occurrence of the character `'-'`. This step is not relevant to finding the optimal splits and is incorrect.

3. **Counting Balance:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `expression`.
   - If the character is `'+'`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is `'-'`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - Whenever the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` by 1 and resets the `balance` to 0.
   - After the loop, it adds 1 to `count` if the `balance` is greater than 0.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Splitting Approach:**
  - The initial splitting using `split('-')` is not relevant to finding the optimal subarrays. This step is unnecessary and incorrect.

- **Incorrect Penalty Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. It only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This does not account for the actual penalties of the subarrays.

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, one needs to find a way to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of zero, or as close to zero as possible. This involves a more sophisticated algorithm, such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach that keeps track of the balance and splits the array optimally.

#### Annotated Code Analysis

The annotations provided describe the state of the program before and after the function call. The annotations confirm that the function `func_1` only counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end. This is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

#### Conclusion

Given the issues in the provided program, it is clear that it does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
