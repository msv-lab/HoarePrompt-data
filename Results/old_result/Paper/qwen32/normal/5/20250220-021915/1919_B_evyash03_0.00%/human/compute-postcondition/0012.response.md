The code snippet sets the variable `balance` to 0. The other variables (`expression`, `length`, and `count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters '+' and '-', `length` is an integer such that `length = len(expression)` and `1 <= length <= 5000`, `count` is 1, and `balance` is 0.**
