#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of characters '+' and '-', and length is an integer such that length = len(expression) and 1 <= length <= 5000.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: - `count` will be the number of times `balance` was reset to 0 due to becoming negative.
    #- `balance` will be the net balance after processing all characters in `expression`.
    #
    #To determine the exact final values of `count` and `balance`, we would need the specific string `expression`. However, based on the behavior described, the final state after the loop completes can be summarized as follows:
    #
    #Output State:
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the value of `count` plus 1 if `balance` is greater than 0, otherwise it returns `count`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function evaluates a string of '+' and '-' characters, counting the number of times a running balance becomes negative, resetting it to zero each time. It also checks if the final balance is positive. The result is the count of resets plus one if the final balance is positive, otherwise just the count.
