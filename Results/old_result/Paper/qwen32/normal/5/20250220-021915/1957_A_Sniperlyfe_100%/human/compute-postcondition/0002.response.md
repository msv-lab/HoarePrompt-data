The code snippet `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` updates the `freq` dictionary by incrementing the count of the key `n` by 1. If `n` does not already exist in the dictionary, it is added with a count of 1. The values of `arr` and the other elements in `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of sticks in the test case, and the next `n` elements are integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks; `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and its value incremented by 1**.
