Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap
- We need to form the maximum number of regular polygons using the given sticks.
- Each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick.
- No stick can be used in more than one polygon.
- The number of sides of the polygon can vary, but all sides must be of equal length.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and the list of stick lengths (`arr`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It then calculates the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3 (`v // 3` for each `v` in `freq.values()`).

3. **Logic Evaluation**:
   - The function assumes that each regular polygon must have exactly 3 sides (triangles).
   - This is incorrect because regular polygons can have more than 3 sides (e.g., squares, pentagons, hexagons, etc.).
   - The program does not consider polygons with more than 3 sides, which means it might not be able to form polygons with 4, 5, or more sides even if the sticks allow it.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because it only considers the formation of triangles (3-sided polygons) and does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with 4 or more sides. Therefore, it might not return the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

### Correctness: **False**
