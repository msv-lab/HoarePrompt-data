Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element `n` represents the number of sticks in the test case, and the next `n` elements are integers representing the lengths of the sticks; `freq` is a dictionary with `n` as a key and its value incremented by 1; `n` is the next number of sticks for the next test case in `arr`. The value of `freq[n]` has been incremented by 1.**

Natural Language: The value of `freq[n]` has been incremented by 1, reflecting an additional occurrence of `n` in the data. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
