#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of sticks in the test case, and the next n elements are integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements where the first element `n` represents the number of sticks in the test case, and the next `n` elements are integers representing the lengths of the sticks; `freq` is a dictionary with each unique number of sticks `n` as keys and their respective counts as values across all test cases.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer divisions of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a list `arr` where the first element `t` indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of sticks. The function calculates and returns the sum of the integer divisions of the frequency of each unique stick length by 3 across all test cases.
