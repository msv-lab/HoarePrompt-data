The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `num` was the last integer in this range.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider if there is another iteration possible. Since the loop iterates over a fixed range, the next iteration would only be possible if `num` was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration. If `num` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, there is no next iteration.

Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `num` was the last integer in the range (i.e., `num` was `n`), there is no next iteration. However, if we hypothetically consider the state right before the last iteration, `num` would be `n-1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration (if it existed) would be:
State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a`, then `max_score` is 1 if `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, otherwise `max_score` remains 0. If `num` is not in `count_a`, `max_score` remains 0. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `num` is `n`**

However, since `num` is `n` at the end of the last iteration, there is no next iteration. If we were to describe the state right before the last iteration, it would be:
State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a`, then `max_score` is 1 if `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, otherwise `max_score` remains 0. If `num` is not in `count_a`, `max_score` remains 0. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `num` is `n-1`**

Since the task specifies the state at the start of the next iteration and there is no next iteration when `num` is `n`, the state description should reflect the hypothetical state right before the last iteration.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`. If `num` is in `count_a`, then `max_score` is 1 if `count_a[num]` is equal to 2, otherwise `max_score` remains 0. If `num` is not in `count_a`, `max_score` remains 0. `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `num` is `n-1`**
