Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`. The current value of `num` is in `count_a`. `max_score` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**
