The code snippet provided initializes a variable `max_score` to 0. No other variables are modified or used in this snippet. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `max_score`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`; `max_score` is 0.**
