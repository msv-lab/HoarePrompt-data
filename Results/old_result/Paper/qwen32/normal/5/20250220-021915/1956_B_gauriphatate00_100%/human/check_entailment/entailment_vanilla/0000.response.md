Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The objective of the game is to maximize the points you can get by strategically choosing the cards to play. The game involves two players, you and Nene, and each player has `n` cards. Each card has an integer from `1` to `n`, and each integer appears exactly twice in the deck. You and Nene take turns, and you get a point if the card you play matches a card already on the table.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize your points. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get if you play optimally.

### Key Insight:
The key insight here is that you can only get a point if you play a card that has already been played by either you or Nene. Therefore, the only way to maximize your points is to play cards that have already been placed on the table.

### Optimal Strategy:
- If a card appears twice in your hand, you can guarantee a point by playing one of the cards first, and then playing the second card when it's your turn again.
- If a card appears only once in your hand, you can only hope that Nene plays the matching card before you do.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution counts the occurrences of each card in your hand using a dictionary (`count_a`). It then calculates the maximum score you can get by counting the number of cards that appear exactly twice in your hand. This is because, for each such card, you can guarantee a point by playing one of the cards first and then playing the second card when it's your turn again.

### Correctness:
The solution correctly implements the optimal strategy for the game. By counting the cards that appear twice in your hand, it correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can guarantee. This is because these are the only cards for which you can ensure that you will get a point.

Thus, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
