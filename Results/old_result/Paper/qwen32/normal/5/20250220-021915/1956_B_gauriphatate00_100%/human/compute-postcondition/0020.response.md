Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`. The current value of `num` is in `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is equal to 2. `max_score` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**

In simple terms, the list `a` and dictionary `count_a` remain unchanged. The value of `max_score` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The value of `n` and the conditions regarding the elements in `a` and `count_a` are still valid.
