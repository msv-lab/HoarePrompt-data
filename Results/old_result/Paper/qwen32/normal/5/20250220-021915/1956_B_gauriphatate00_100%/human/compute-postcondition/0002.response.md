Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` must have at least one element; `count_a` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is `num` and `num` is an element of `a`**
