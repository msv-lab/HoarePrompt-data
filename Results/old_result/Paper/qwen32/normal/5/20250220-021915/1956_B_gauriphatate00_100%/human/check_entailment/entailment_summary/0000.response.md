### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points we can get in a card game where we and Nene each have `n` cards, and the cards are numbered from 1 to `n` with each number appearing exactly twice. The scoring rule is that a player earns a point if the card they play has already been placed on the table.

The key insight is that the optimal strategy for both players involves playing pairs of cards strategically. However, since Nene is playing optimally and aims to maximize her score while minimizing ours, we need to determine the best possible score we can achieve regardless of her moves.

The provided program counts the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a` (our hand of cards). This count represents the maximum number of points we can score because, for each pair of cards we have, we can play the second card and earn a point if the first card has already been placed on the table.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. This count directly corresponds to the maximum number of points we can achieve, assuming optimal play from Nene.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum score we can achieve.

### Correctness: **True**
