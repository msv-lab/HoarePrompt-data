Let's carefully analyze the provided solution and the problem description to ensure that the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis Recap:
- **Objective:** Maximize your points by strategically choosing cards.
- **Turn System:** You and Nene take turns, with Nene playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize yours.
- **Point Scoring:** You get a point if you play a card that has already been played by either player.
- **Card Distribution:** Each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck.

### Key Insight Recap:
- **Guaranteed Points:** If you have a pair of the same card, you can guarantee a point by playing one card and then playing the second card when it's your turn again.
- **Non-Guaranteed Points:** If you have a single card, you can only hope that Nene plays the matching card before you do.

### Solution Analysis Recap:
- **Counting Pairs:** The solution uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
- **Calculating Maximum Score:** It calculates the number of cards that appear exactly twice in your hand, as these are the only cards that can guarantee you a point.

### Function Summary Recap:
- **Function `func_1`:** Counts the occurrences of each card in the list `a` and returns the count of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 2 times in the list `a`.

### Evaluation:
The solution correctly identifies that you can only guarantee a point if you have a pair of the same card. By counting the number of such pairs, the solution calculates the maximum number of points you can guarantee. This aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem analysis.

### Consider Edge Cases:
- **All Unique Cards:** If all cards in your hand are unique, the solution correctly returns 0 points because you cannot guarantee any points.
- **All Pairs:** If all cards in your hand are pairs, the solution correctly returns the number of pairs because you can guarantee a point for each pair.
- **Mixed Cards:** The solution correctly handles cases where you have a mix of unique cards and pairs by counting only the pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The solution correctly implements the optimal strategy for the game by counting the number of pairs in your hand, which directly corresponds to the maximum number of points you can guarantee.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
