You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers of length n, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5. `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`.
    max_score = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a:
            if count_a[num] == 2:
                max_score += 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times. `count_a` is a dictionary where each unique integer from the list `a` is a key, and its value is the number of times that integer appears in `a`. `max_score` is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 2 times in the list `a`. `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
    return max_score
    #The program returns max_score, which is the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly 2 times in the list a.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers of length `n`, where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns `max_score`, which is the number of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly 2 times in the list `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns max_score, which is the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly 2 times in the list a.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
