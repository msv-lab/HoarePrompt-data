### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of points you can score in a card game against Nene, who plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The key point is that you score a point if the card you play has already been played by either of you.

The provided solution calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting how many numbers from 1 to n appear exactly twice in your hand. This is because if a number appears exactly twice in your hand, you can play one of the cards and score a point when you play the second card, assuming Nene doesn't play the same card in between.

The function `func_1` correctly counts how many numbers from 1 to n appear exactly twice in the list `a` (your hand). This count represents the maximum number of points you can score if Nene plays optimally to minimize your score. 

The logic is sound because:
1. If a number appears exactly twice in your hand, you can play one card and then score a point when you play the second card.
2. If a number appears only once in your hand, you cannot score a point with it.
3. Nene's optimal strategy doesn't affect the count of numbers that appear exactly twice in your hand, as she will try to maximize her score and minimize yours, but this doesn't change the fact that if you have pairs, you can score points with them.
