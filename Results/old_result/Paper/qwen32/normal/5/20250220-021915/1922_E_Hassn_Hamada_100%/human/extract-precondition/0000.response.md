Precondition: **number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers representing the array. The length of the sequence should be at most 200 if it satisfies the condition of having exactly 'number' increasing subsequences. If no such sequence exists, sequence should be an empty list or the function should handle the case internally to return -1.**
