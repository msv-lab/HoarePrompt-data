The code `value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)` calculates the new value of `value` based on the current values of `size` and `i`. Given that `size` is 4 and `i` is 1, we can substitute these values into the expression:

- `1 << size` is equivalent to `1 << 4`, which is `16` (since shifting 1 left by 4 positions in binary gives 10000, which is 16 in decimal).
- `1 << i` is equivalent to `1 << 1`, which is `2` (since shifting 1 left by 1 position in binary gives 10, which is 2 in decimal).

Thus, `value` is updated to `16 - 2`, which is `14`.

The other variables (`number`, `sequence`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`number` must be at least 7, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size` is 4, `value` is 14, `i` is 1**.
