Postcondition: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers representing the array. The length of the sequence should be at most 200 if it satisfies the condition of having exactly 'number' increasing subsequences. The current value of `number` is 0. Since `number` is 0, `sequence` should be an empty list or the function should handle the case internally to return -1.**
