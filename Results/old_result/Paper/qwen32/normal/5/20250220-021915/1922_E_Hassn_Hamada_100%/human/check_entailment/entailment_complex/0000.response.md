### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to generate an array of integers such that the array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program uses a recursive function `func_1` to build this array. However, there are several issues and missing parts in the provided code that make it incorrect based on the problem description and the provided comments.

1. **Base Case Handling**: The base case for the recursion is when `number == 0`. In this case, the function returns `(0, 0)`. However, this return value is not utilized or checked in the main loop, and it does not handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated.

2. **Recursive Case Handling**: The recursive case involves modifying the `sequence` list and making a recursive call with a reduced `number`. However, the function does not handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated, and it does not return `-1` as required.

3. **Output Handling**: The program prints the length of the `result` list and then the list itself. However, if no valid sequence is found, it should print `-1` instead.

4. **Logic for Generating the Sequence**: The logic for generating the sequence is based on finding the largest power of 2 that fits into the remaining `number` of subsequences. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the generation of the sequence or the reduction of `number`.

5. **Comments and States**: The comments and states provided in the code do not accurately reflect the actual behavior of the code. For example, the state after the function call is not correctly described, and the handling of the `size_overlap` variable is not properly explained.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program is not correct. It does not handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated, and it does not correctly generate the sequence to meet the requirements of the problem.

### Correctness: **False**
