The given code snippet is a function call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)`. This function call does not directly modify any of the variables in the initial state but rather passes the computed value as an argument to `func_1`. The variable `sequence` remains unchanged.

Let's break down the expression `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`:
- `1 << size` computes 2 raised to the power of `size`.
- `1 << overlap` computes 2 raised to the power of `overlap`.

The exact value of the expression depends on the values of `number`, `size`, and `overlap`, which are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the expression remains as it is, and we cannot compute a specific numeric value for it.

Output State: **`sequence` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; the function `func_1` is called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].**
