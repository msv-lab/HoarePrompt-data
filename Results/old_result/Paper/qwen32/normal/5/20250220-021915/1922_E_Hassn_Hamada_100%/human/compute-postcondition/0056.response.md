The code appends the value of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`. The initial state specifies that `size` is greater than `overlap`, but this condition is not affected by the code snippet provided. The only change is that the list `sequence` now includes an additional element, which is the sum of `i` and `overlap`.

Output State: **`size` is greater than `overlap`; `sequence` has an additional element equal to `i + overlap`.**
