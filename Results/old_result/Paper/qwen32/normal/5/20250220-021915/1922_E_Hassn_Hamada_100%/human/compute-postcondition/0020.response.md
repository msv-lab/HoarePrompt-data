Postcondition: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with at least one element, `size` is floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1, `value` is 2^(floor(log2(number + 1)) - 1) - 1. If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, then `size_overlap` is (size, i). Otherwise, `size_overlap` remains (0, 0).**
