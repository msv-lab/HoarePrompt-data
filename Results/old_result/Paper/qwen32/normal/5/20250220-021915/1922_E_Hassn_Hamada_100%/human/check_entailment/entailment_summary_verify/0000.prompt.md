You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `number` and a list `sequence`. It modifies `sequence` to potentially satisfy the condition of having exactly `number` increasing subsequences. If no such sequence can be generated, it returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns (0, 0). However, based on the provided code, the function does not handle the case where no valid sequence exists and always returns (0, 0) if `number` is not 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program seems to be attempting to generate a sequence that has exactly X increasing subsequences. However, there are a few issues with the code that suggest it may not work correctly for all inputs.

1. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is called recursively to generate the sequence. However, the function is not correctly appending elements to the sequence in a way that guarantees the number of increasing subsequences will be exactly X.

2. **Base Case Handling**: The base case in `func_1` when `number == 0` returns a tuple `(0, 0)`, which is not used correctly in the recursive calls or in the main loop.

3. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly X increasing subsequences. The logic for generating the sequence and adjusting the `number` to be subtracted is not clear and may not be correct for all values of X.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if X is a very large number, the program may not be able to generate a sequence that has exactly X increasing subsequences within the constraints provided.

To verify the correctness, let's consider a simple test case:

- **Test Case**: X = 2
- **Expected Output**: An array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences. For example, `[0]` has 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
- **Actual Output**: The program may not generate the correct sequence for X = 2 or any other input due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these points, it is clear that the program does not correctly generate a sequence with exactly X increasing subsequences for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
