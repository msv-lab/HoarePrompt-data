The code appends the value of `i + overlap` to the `sequence` list. Given that `i` is `i + 2` from the initial state, the new element added to `sequence` will be `(i + 2) + overlap`.

Output State: **`size` is greater than `overlap`; `sequence` has an additional element equal to `(i + 2) + overlap`; `i` is `i + 2`**.
