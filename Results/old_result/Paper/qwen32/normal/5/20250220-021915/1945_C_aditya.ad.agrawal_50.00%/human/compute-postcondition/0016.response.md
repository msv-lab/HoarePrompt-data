Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is set to `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.**
