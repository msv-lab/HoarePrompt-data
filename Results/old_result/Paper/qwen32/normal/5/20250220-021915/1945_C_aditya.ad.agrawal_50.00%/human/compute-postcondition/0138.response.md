The given code snippet updates the value of `b_d` to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. All other variables remain unchanged or are not affected by this particular line of code.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and `ans` is `pos`.**
