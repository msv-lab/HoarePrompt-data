The code snippet `input_string = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `input_string`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, `pos`, `b_d`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the total count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is the position where conditions were met or 0, `pos` is `len(arr)`, `b_d` is the minimum `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where conditions were met or 30001**.
