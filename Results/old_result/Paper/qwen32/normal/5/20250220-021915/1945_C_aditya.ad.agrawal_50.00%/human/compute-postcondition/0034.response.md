Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `ans` is `pos` and `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `b_d` retains its original value. `i` is the next element in `arr`. `pos` is incremented by 1, `o_l` is incremented by 1.** 

In simpler terms, the variable `o_l` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values or states.
