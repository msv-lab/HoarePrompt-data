The given code snippet updates the `arr` variable by converting each character in `input_string` to an integer and storing it in a list. This means `arr` will now contain a list of integers derived from `input_string`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is the position where the conditions are last met (or 0 if never met), `pos` is the length of `arr`, and `b_d` is the smallest `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions are met (or 30001 if never met).**

In simpler terms, the list `arr` is now a list of integers converted from the characters of `input_string`. All other variables retain their initial values.
