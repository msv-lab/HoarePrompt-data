Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers derived from `input_string` that must have at least one element, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `pos` is `pos + 1`. If `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)`, then `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)` and `ans` is set to `pos`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. `b_d` is `abs(n / 2 - pos)` if the condition is met, otherwise `b_d` retains its previous value. `i` is the next element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The value of `pos` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
