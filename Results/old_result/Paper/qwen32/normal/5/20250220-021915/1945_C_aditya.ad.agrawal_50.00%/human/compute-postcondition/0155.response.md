Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of houses in a village and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. Each '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side, and each '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The function determines and prints the position in the string where the number of residents wanting to live on the left side and the number of residents wanting to live on the right side are as balanced as possible around the midpoint of the string.**
