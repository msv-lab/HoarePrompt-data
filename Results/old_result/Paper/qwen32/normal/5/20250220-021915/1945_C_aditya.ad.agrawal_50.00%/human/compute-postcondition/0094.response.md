The code snippet provided is `o_l += 1`, which means the variable `o_l` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is the input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string` and must have at least 2 elements, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `o_l` is incremented by 1.**
