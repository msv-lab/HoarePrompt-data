The provided code snippet reassigns the value of `dist`, `ans`, and `pos` based on the expression `abs(n / 2)` and sets `ans` and `pos` to `0`. The values of `n`, `a`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, `o_r`, and `b_d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `input_string` is the new string input by the user, `arr` is the list of integers derived from `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `z_r` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o_r` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `b_d` is the smallest `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where the conditions are met (or 30001 if never met).**
