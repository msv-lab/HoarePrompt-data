The code snippet creates a `Counter` object named `b_freq` using the list `b`. This `Counter` object will hold the frequency of each integer in the list `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `k`, `n`, `m`, and `good_subarrays` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, all elements in `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `good_subarrays` is 0; `b_freq` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in `b`.**
