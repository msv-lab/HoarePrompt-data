Let's break down the given information step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(P - M)` statement.

### Initial State and Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000.
- `s` is the new input integer.
- `e` is the new input string.
- `P` is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` is the count of all other characters in the string `e`.
- `i` is `i + 2` (Note: The value of `i` is not used in the `print` statement, so it can be ignored for this task).

### Calculation of `P` and `M`:
- `P` is the number of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` is the number of all other characters in the string `e`.

### Expression to be Printed:
- The expression `P - M` will be evaluated and printed.

### Output Explanation:
The output will be the result of the expression `P - M`, which is the difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of all other characters in the string `e`.

Since the exact value of `e` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `P` and `M`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output as the difference between the count of '+' characters and the count of all other characters in the string `e`.

### Final Output:
Output: **P - M (where P is the count of '+' characters in the string `e`, and M is the count of all other characters in the string `e`)**
