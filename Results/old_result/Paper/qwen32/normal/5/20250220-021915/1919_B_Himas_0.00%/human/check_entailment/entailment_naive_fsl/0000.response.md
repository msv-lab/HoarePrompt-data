Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints it. This does not take into account the process of splitting the array into non-empty subarrays to minimize the total penalty, which involves calculating the penalty for each subarray based on the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

Let's consider the example inputs provided in the problem statement:

1. For the input `+`, the output should be `1` because the array is `[1]` and the penalty is `|1| * 1 = 1`.
2. For the input `-----`, the output should be `5` because the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])` and the total penalty is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
3. For the input `+-+-+-`, the output should be `0` because the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])` and the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.

The provided program does not handle these cases correctly. It simply prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
