The code snippet `s = int(input())` attempts to convert the input into an integer and assign it to the variable `s`. However, the initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters '+' and '-'. This means that the input operation will overwrite the original string `s` with an integer value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer.**
