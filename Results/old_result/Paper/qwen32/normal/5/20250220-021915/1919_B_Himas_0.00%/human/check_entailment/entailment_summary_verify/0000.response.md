### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints this difference. This does not take into account the process of splitting the array into non-empty subarrays to minimize the total penalty, which involves calculating the penalty for each subarray based on the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

Let's break down the issues with the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `P - M`, where `P` is the count of '+' characters and `M` is the count of '-' characters. This is not the penalty as defined in the problem. The penalty for a subarray is calculated as `|sum(subarray)| * length(subarray)`, and the goal is to minimize the total penalty across all subarrays.

2. **Lack of Subarray Splitting**: The program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays at all. It simply counts the '+' and '-' characters and computes their difference, which does not address the requirement to split the array optimally to minimize the penalty.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `+`, the output should be `1` because the array is `[1]` and the penalty is `|1| * 1 = 1`.
   - For the input `-----`, the output should be `5` because the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])` and the total penalty is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the output should be `0` because the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])` and the total penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.

The provided program does not handle these cases correctly. It simply prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
