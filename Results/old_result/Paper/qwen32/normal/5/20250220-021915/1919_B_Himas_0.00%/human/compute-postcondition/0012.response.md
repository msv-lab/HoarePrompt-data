Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e` after the current value of `q`, `P` is 2 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `P` is 1, and `M` is 1 if `q` does not equal '+', otherwise `M` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `P` is incremented by 1. If `q` originally equals '+', `P` was 1 and is now 2. If `q` does not equal '+', `P` was 0 and is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
