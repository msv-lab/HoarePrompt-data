Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000, `s` is the input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `q` is not equal to `'+'`.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
