Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to split the given string `s` into non-empty subarrays in such a way that the total penalty is minimized.
2. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length.
3. The given program, however, does not implement any logic for splitting the array or calculating the penalty based on any splits. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints the difference (`P - M`).

Let's analyze why the given program is incorrect:
- The program does not consider any splitting of the array.
- It does not calculate the penalty based on any splits.
- The output (`P - M`) is not related to the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement.

For example, in the third test case:
- The string is `+-+-+-`.
- The program calculates `P = 3` (number of '+') and `M = 3` (number of '-') and prints `P - M = 0`.
- However, the correct output should be `0` because we can split the array into `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` which results in a total penalty of `0`.

Thus, the given program does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
