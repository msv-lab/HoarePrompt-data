The code snippet provided sets `list1` to an empty list. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is 0; `n`, `t`, `b`, `str` remain unchanged; `final` includes the value of `s` (before it was reset) appended to it; `num` is the previous value of `num` plus 1; `list2` is an empty list; `a` is the user input string; `list1` is an empty list.**
