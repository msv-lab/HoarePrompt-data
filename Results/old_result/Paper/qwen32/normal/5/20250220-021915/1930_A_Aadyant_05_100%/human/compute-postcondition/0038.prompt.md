Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is a list containing `s`, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the new input string provided by the user, `b` is the new input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of words from `b`, `str` is the last element of `list1` that was processed by the loop, `i` is the last even index that is less than the length of `list2`, `num` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for str in list1:
    list2.append(int(str))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is a list containing `s`, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str`, `a` is the new input string provided by the user, `b` is the new input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must contain at least one element, `i` is the last even index that is less than the length of `list2`, `num` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is a list containing `s`, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str` and all its previous elements, `a` is the new input string provided by the user, `b` is the new input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must contain at least two elements, `i` is the last even index that is less than the length of `list2`, `num` is incremented by 1, `str` is the next element in `list1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is a list containing `s`, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str` and all its previous elements plus the new integer value of `str`, `a` is the new input string provided by the user, `b` is the new input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must contain at least two elements, `i` is the last even index that is less than the length of `list2`, `num` is incremented by 1, `str` is the next element in `list1` after the current `str`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
