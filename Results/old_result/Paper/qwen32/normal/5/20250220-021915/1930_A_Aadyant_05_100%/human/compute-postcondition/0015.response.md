Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, `a` is the input string provided by the user, `b` is an input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `b` on whitespace, `str` is the last element of `list1` that was processed by the loop.`**

In simple terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, `list2` will contain all the integer values obtained from splitting the input string `b` by whitespace. The variables `n`, `t`, `final`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `str` will hold the value of the last substring from `list1` that was converted to an integer and added to `list2`.
