The code snippet `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. This affects the order of elements in `list2` but does not change any other variables. The values of `n`, `t`, `final`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, `i`, `num`, and `str` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is a list containing `s`, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in `list1`, sorted in ascending order, `a` is the new input string provided by the user, `b` is the new input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of words from `b`, `i` is the last even index that is less than the length of `list2`, `num` is incremented by 1, `str` is the last element of `list1`.**
