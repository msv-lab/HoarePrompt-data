Output State: **`s` is `s + int(list2[i]) + int(list2[i + 2])`; `n`, `t`, `final`, `num`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all words in `list1` and must have at least one element; `i` is `i + 2`**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the integer value of the element at index `i + 2` in `list2`, in addition to the previous value of `s` and the integer value of the element at index `i` in `list2`. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `final`, `num`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. The list `list2` is still a sorted list of integer values derived from `list1`, and `i` has been incremented by 2.
