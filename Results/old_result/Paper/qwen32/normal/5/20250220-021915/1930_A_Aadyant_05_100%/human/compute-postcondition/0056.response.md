Output State: **`s` is 0; `n`, `t`, `str` remain unchanged; `final` includes the value of `s` (before it was reset) appended to it; `num` is the previous value of `num` plus 1; `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str`; `a` is the user input string; `list1` is a list of words from the string `b` that must have at least one word; `str` is the first word in `list1`.**

In natural language: The value of `s` is still 0. The variables `n`, `t`, and `str` remain unchanged. The variable `final` now includes the previous value of `s` appended to it. The variable `num` has been incremented by 1. The variable `list2` now contains the integer value of `str`. The variable `a` still holds the user input string. The variable `list1` still contains a list of words from the string `b` with at least one word. The variable `str` still holds the first word in `list1`.
