The code snippet `list2.append(int(str))` appends the integer value of `str` to the list `list2`. This means that `list2` will now contain one additional element, which is the integer value of `str`.

Given the initial state, `list2` already contains the integer value of `str` and all its previous elements. After executing the code, `list2` will have one more element, which is the integer value of the new `str` (the next element in `list1` after the current `str`).

Here is the updated output state with all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed:

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer that is at least 1, `t` is between 1 and 5000, `final` is a list containing `s`, `s` is 0, `list2` is a list containing the integer value of `str` and all its previous elements plus the new integer value of `str`, `a` is the new input string provided by the user, `b` is the new input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must contain at least two elements, `i` is the last even index that is less than the length of `list2`, `num` is incremented by 1, `str` is the next element in `list1` after the current `str`.**
