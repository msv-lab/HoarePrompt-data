Output State: **`b` is the new input string provided by the user that must contain at least one non-whitespace character, `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least one element, `s` is updated to `s + int(list2[i])`, `i` is 2, `s` is now `s + int(list2[2])`**

In natural language: The value of `s` is updated by adding the integer value of the element at index 2 of `list2` to it. The values of `b`, `list1`, and `i` remain unchanged.
