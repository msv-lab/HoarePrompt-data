The code snippet provided sorts the list `list2`. Since `list2` is a list of integer values derived from `list1`, sorting `list2` will arrange its elements in ascending order.

Output State: **`s` is 0; `n`, `t`, `final`, `num`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged; `list2` is a sorted list of integer values of all words in `list1`.** 

This means that all the variables `s`, `n`, `t`, `final`, `num`, and `b` retain their initial values, while `list2` is now sorted in ascending order.
