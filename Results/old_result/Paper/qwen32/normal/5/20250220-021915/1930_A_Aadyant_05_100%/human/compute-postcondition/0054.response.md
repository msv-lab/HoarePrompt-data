The code snippet `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of words based on whitespace. This means `list1` will now hold the list of words from the string `b`.

Output State: **`s` is 0; `n`, `t`, `str` remain unchanged; `final` includes the value of `s` (before it was reset) appended to it; `num` is the previous value of `num` plus 1; `list2` is an empty list; `a` is the user input string; `list1` is a list of words from the string `b`; `b` is the user input string.**

In natural language: The variable `list1` is now a list of words from the string `b`, while all other variables retain their previous values except for `list1`, which has been updated to reflect the split operation.
