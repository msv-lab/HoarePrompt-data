To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes each test case and how the variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` influence the final result stored in `results`.

### Key Points:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
2. **Variables**:
   - `reachable_first_row` starts as `True` and is set to `False` if a character in `row1` is not `'>'` or if we reach the end of `row1`.
   - `reachable_second_row` starts as `False` and can be set to `True` if we can move from `row1` to `row2` or if we reach the end of `row2` with `'>'` in `row2`.
3. **Result**: For each test case, if `reachable_second_row` is `True` after processing the rows, `'YES'` is appended to `results`; otherwise, `'NO'` is appended.

### Given Output States:
- After the first iteration: `results` contains either `['YES']` or `['NO']`.
- After the second iteration: `results` contains either `['NO', 'YES']` or `['NO', 'NO']`.
- After the third iteration: `results` contains either `['NO', 'YES', 'YES']`, `['NO', 'YES', 'NO']`, or `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, `results` will contain a list of strings `'YES'` or `'NO'` corresponding to each test case in `test_cases`.

### Output State:
Given that `t` is the number of test cases, the final `results` list will have `t` elements, each being either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the processing of each test case.

**Output State: **results** is a list of length `t` containing strings 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
The final output state is a list `results` that contains a string `'YES'` or `'NO'` for each test case in `test_cases`. The length of this list is equal to the number of test cases `t`. Each string in the list indicates whether it is possible to move from the first row to the second row in the corresponding test case based on the rules defined in the loop.
