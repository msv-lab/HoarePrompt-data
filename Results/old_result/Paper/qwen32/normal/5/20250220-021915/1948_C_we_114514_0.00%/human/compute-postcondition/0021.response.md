Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` retains its initial value (either `True` or `False`). Additionally, `row2[j]` is `'>'`, and `j` is equal to `n - 1` (which means `j` is 3).**

Explanation: The value of `reachable_second_row` is explicitly set to `True` in the code snippet. All other variables retain their initial values as they are not modified by the code.
