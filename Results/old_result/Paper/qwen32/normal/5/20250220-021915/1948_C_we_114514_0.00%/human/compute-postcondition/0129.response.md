The provided code snippet simply reassigns the value `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`, which already holds the value `True`. Therefore, this assignment does not change the state of `reachable_second_row`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`. `reachable_second_row` is True. `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. `j` is equal to `n - 1`. `row2[j]` is `'>'`. The values of `reachable_first_row` and `j` remain unchanged.**
