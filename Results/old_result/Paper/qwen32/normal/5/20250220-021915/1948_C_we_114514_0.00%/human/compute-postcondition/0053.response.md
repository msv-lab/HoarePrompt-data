Output State: **t is 1, test_cases is a list containing at least one tuple, results is ['NO'], n is 4, row1 is "<<", row2 is ">><<", reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is False**

Natural language: The `results` list now contains the string 'NO'. All other variables retain their initial values.
