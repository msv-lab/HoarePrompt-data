Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO', `j` is 2. If `reachable_first_row` is True, and `row1[j] == '>'` and `j == n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is set to True. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `row1[j] != '>'`, `reachable_first_row` is set to False. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `row1[j] == '>'` and `j < n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` retains its original value. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `row1[j] != '>'` and `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, `reachable_second_row` is set to True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` retains its original value. If `reachable_first_row` is False, no changes are made to `reachable_first_row` or `reachable_second_row`.**
