The code snippet unpacks the first tuple from the `test_cases` list into `n` and a tuple containing `row1` and `row2`. Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged, and `results` remains an empty list. The first tuple in `test_cases` is `(4, "<<>>", ">><<")`, so `n` is assigned the value `4`, `row1` is assigned the value `"<<"`, and `row2` is assigned the value `">><<"`. 

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, e.g., `[(4, "<<>>", ">><<")]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"`**
