Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one more tuple after the first one, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing the strings 'NO' and 'YES', `j` is incremented by 1, `reachable_first_row` is False.**

In this output state, `reachable_second_row` has been set to `True`, which means `results` will now contain the strings 'NO' and 'YES'. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described.
