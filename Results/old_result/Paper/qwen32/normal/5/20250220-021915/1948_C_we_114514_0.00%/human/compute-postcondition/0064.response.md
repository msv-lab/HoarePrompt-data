Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO'. The current value of `reachable_first_row` is True. If `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` is True. Additionally, `row1[j]` is equal to `'>'`.**
