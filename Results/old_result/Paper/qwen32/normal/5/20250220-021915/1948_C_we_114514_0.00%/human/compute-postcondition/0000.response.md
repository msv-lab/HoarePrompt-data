Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and two strings of length n, where n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the strings consist only of the characters '<' and '>'; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `results` has been initialized as an empty list, while the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
