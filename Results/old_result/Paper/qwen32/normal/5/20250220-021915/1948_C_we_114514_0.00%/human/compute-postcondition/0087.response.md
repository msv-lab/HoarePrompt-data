Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO', `j` is incremented by 1, `reachable_first_row` is False if `row1[j] != '>'`, otherwise unchanged, `reachable_second_row` is True.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `reachable_second_row` has been set to `True`. The values of other variables remain as described in the initial state, with the exception that `reachable_first_row` will be set to `False` if `row1[j]` is not equal to `'>'`. The variable `j` has been incremented by 1.
