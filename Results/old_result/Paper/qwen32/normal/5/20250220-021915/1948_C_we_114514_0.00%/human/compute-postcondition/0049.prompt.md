Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, e.g., `[(4, "<<>>", ">><<")]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<", `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` retains its initial value (either `True` or `False`). If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it implies that `row2[j]` is `'>'` when `j` is equal to `n - 1` (which is 3). If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, then the else part does not execute, and `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` retains its initial value unless `row1[j]` is not `'>'` and `j` is not less than `n - 1` or `row2[j]` is not `'>'`, in which case `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`. Since `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is updated based on the conditions involving `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`. If `row2[j]` is `'>'`, no further change is made to `reachable_first_row`. `j` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. `reachable_first_row` is `False` if `row1[j]` is not `'>'` and `j` is not less than `n - 1`, or if `row2[j]` is not `'>'`. Since `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is updated based on the conditions involving `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`. If `row2[j]` is `'>'`, `reachable_first_row` retains its initial value. If `row2[j]` is not `'>'`, `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`. `j` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
