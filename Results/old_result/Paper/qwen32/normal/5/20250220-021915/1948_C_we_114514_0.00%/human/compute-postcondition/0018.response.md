Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is 4, `row1` is `"<<"`, `row2` is `">><<"` and `reachable_second_row` is `True`. If `reachable_first_row` is `True`, then `reachable_first_row` remains `True`. If `reachable_first_row` is `False`, then `reachable_first_row` remains `False`.**
