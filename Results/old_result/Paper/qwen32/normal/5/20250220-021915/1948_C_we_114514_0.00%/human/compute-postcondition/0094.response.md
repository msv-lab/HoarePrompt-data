The code snippet sets `reachable_first_row` to `False`, and this is the only change made to the variables. All other variables retain their initial values or states.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `test_cases` is a list containing at least two tuples, `n` is greater than 0, `row1` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `row2` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the string 'NO', `j` is 2, `reachable_first_row` is False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, it remains True. If `row2[j] == '>'` and `j == n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is set to True.**
