To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand how the loop evolves and under what conditions it terminates.

The loop continues until `n` becomes zero or the condition `s < k <= s + x` is met. Let's break down the loop's effect on the variables:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `s = 0`
   - `m = 1`
   - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration.
   - `n` is halved (`n //= 2`) in each iteration.
   - `s` is incremented by `x` in each iteration.
   - `m` is doubled (`m *= 2`) in each iteration.

2. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates if `n` becomes zero.
   - Alternatively, the loop terminates if `s < k <= s + x` during any iteration.

Given the initial state and the first three iterations:
- After the first iteration: `n` is halved, `s` becomes `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` becomes 2.
- After the second iteration: `n` is halved again, `s` becomes `2 * ((n + 1) // 2)`, `m` becomes 4.
- After the third iteration: `n` is halved again, `s` becomes `2 * ((n // 2 + 1) // 2) + (n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `m` becomes 8.

The loop continues halving `n`, doubling `m`, and updating `s` by adding `x` until `n` becomes zero or the condition `s < k <= s + x` is met.

### Final Output State:
The loop will terminate when `n` becomes zero. At this point:
- `n` will be `0`.
- `s` will be the sum of all `x` values calculated during the iterations.
- `m` will be `2` raised to the power of the number of iterations.
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

Let's formalize the final state:
- `n` is `0`.
- `m` is `2` raised to the power of the number of iterations it took for `n` to become `0`.
- `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- `k` remains the same as the second integer from the input.
- `t` remains the same as the initial integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\).

Given that the number of iterations is the number of times we can halve `n` until it becomes `0`, this is equivalent to the integer part of the base-2 logarithm of the original `n` plus one.

**Output State:**
- `n` is `0`.
- `m` is `2` raised to the power of the number of iterations.
- `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `t` is the initial integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\).

Putting this in the required format:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `0`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration; `m` is `2` raised to the power of the number of iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes:
- `n` will be `0`.
- `m` will be a power of 2 corresponding to the number of iterations.
- `s` will be the sum of the values `(n + 1) // 2` calculated in each iteration.
- `k` and `t` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
