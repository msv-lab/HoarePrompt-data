The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `n` is initially 0 and `k` is an integer. After the execution of the code snippet, `n` and `k` will take on the values provided by the input, while the other variables (`t`, `s`, and `m`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from input; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` values from each iteration until the loop terminates; `m` is \(2^i\) where `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed.**
