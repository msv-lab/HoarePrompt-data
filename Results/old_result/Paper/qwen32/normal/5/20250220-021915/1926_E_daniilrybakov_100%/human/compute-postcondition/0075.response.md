The code snippet `m *= 2` multiplies the variable `m` by 2. Given the initial state, `m` is initially set to 2. After the operation, `m` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is `2 * ((n + 1) // 2)`; `m` is 4; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\).**
