The code snippet `x = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `x` to `(n + 1) // 2`. However, the initial state already defines `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, so this operation does not change the value of `x`.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the exception that the reassignment operation is noted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is `2 * ((n + 1) // 2)`; `m` is 4; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.
