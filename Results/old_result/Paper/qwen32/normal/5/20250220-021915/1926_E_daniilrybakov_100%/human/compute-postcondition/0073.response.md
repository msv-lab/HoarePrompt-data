Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\). If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
