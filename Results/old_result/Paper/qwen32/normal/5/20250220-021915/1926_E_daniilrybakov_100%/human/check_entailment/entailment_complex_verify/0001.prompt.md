You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to lay down cards in a specific order and find the k-th card in that sequence. The sequence is constructed by first placing all odd-numbered cards, then multiples of 2 of odd numbers, then multiples of 3 of odd numbers, and so on.

### Program Analysis
The program uses a binary representation approach to solve the problem efficiently, which is suitable given the large constraints (n, k up to 10^9).

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` (number of cards) and `k` (position of the card to find) are read.
   - `s`: Sum of cards laid down so far.
   - `m`: Multiplier (starts at 1, representing the first sequence of odd numbers).

2. **Loop:**
   - `x = (n + 1) // 2`: Number of odd cards in the current sequence.
   - `n //= 2`: Reduce `n` to consider the next sequence (multiples of the next integer).
   - The loop checks if `k` falls within the current sequence (`s < k <= s + x`). If it does, it breaks out of the loop.
   - If `k` is not in the current sequence, it updates `s` to `s + x` and `m` to `m * 2` to move to the next sequence.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - Once the correct sequence is found, it calculates the k-th card in that sequence using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula works because `k - s` gives the position within the current sequence of odd numbers, which are then scaled by `m`.

### Verification with Example
Let's verify the program with the first test case (n=7, k=1 to 7):

- For k=1 to 4, the program correctly identifies the first sequence (odd numbers) and outputs 1, 3, 5, 7.
- For k=5 to 7, the program correctly identifies the second sequence (multiples of 2 of odd numbers) and outputs 2, 6, 4.

### Conclusion
The program efficiently identifies the k-th card by leveraging the binary representation of the problem, ensuring it works within the given constraints. It correctly handles the sequence generation and position calculation.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
