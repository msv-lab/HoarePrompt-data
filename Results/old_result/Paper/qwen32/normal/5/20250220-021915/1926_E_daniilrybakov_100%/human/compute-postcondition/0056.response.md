To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the values and relationships of the variables `k`, `s`, and `m` based on the initial state provided.

### Variable Definitions:
- `t`: An integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
- `n`: The smallest non-zero integer such that the condition `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is met.
- `k`: The second integer from input.
- `s`: The sum of all `x` values up to the point where the condition is met.
- `m`: \(2\) raised to the power of the number of iterations.

### Steps to Determine the Output:

1. **Determine `n` and `s`**:
   - We iterate through a series of `x` values until we find the smallest `n` such that `s < k` and `k <= s + x`.
   - `s` is the cumulative sum of `x` values up to the point where this condition is met.

2. **Determine `m`**:
   - `m` is calculated as \(2^n\), where `n` is the number of iterations it took to meet the condition.

3. **Evaluate the Print Statement**:
   - The expression `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` is evaluated using the values of `k`, `s`, and `m`.

### Explanation:
- `k` is a given value (from the input).
- `s` is the sum of `x` values up to the point where the condition `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is met.
- `n` is the number of iterations it took to find this point, and `m` is \(2^n\).

### Output Calculation:
- Let's assume we have specific values for `k`, `s`, and `m` based on the input and the iterations:
  - Suppose `k` is 10, `s` is 8, and `n` is 3 (meaning `m` is \(2^3 = 8\)).
  - The expression becomes `(2 * (10 - 8) - 1) * 8`, which simplifies to `(2 * 2 - 1) * 8 = 3 * 8 = 24`.

However, since the specific values of `k`, `s`, and `m` depend on the input and the iterations, we need to express the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the value of the expression `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`, where `k` is the second integer from input, `s` is the sum of `x` values up to the point where the condition `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is met, and `m` is \(2^n\) with `n` being the number of iterations.

Output: **(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m (where k is the second integer from input, s is the sum of x values up to the point where the condition s < k and k <= s + x is met, and m is 2^n with n being the number of iterations)**
