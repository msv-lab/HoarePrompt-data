Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\); and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
