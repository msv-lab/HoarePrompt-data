The code snippet `x = (n + 1) // 2` reassigns the value of `x` to be `(n + 1) // 2`. Given that `x` was initially defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the value of `x` does not change after this line of code is executed. Therefore, the state of the variables remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is at least 2; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is \(n + 1\); `m` is 4; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.
