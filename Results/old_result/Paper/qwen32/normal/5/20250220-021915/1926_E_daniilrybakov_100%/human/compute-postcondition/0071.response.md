The code snippet performs an integer division of `n` by 2, updating the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is `n // 2`; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**

In natural language: The value of `n` is now half of its original value (using integer division). The values of `t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
