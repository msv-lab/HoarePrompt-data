The code snippet sets the variable `m` to 1. This change does not affect any other variables. The precondition about `t`, `n`, `k`, and `s` remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is the first integer from input; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is 0; `m` is 1.**
