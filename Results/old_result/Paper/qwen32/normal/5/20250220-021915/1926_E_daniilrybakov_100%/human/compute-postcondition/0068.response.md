The code snippet `m *= 2` means that the value of `m` is doubled. Given the initial state, `m` is initially 1. After this operation, `m` becomes 2. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 2 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is the result of integer division of the original `n` by 2; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\); `m` is 2; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**
