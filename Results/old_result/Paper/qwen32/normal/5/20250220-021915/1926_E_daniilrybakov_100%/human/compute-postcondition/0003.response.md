The code snippet `s = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer; `s` is 0.**
