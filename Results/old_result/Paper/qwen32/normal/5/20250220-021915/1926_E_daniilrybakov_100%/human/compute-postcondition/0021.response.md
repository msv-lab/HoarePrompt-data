The code snippet reassigns the variable `x` to be `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `x` was previously defined as `(\text{previous } n + 1) // 2`, and the code snippet does not change the value of `n`, the value of `x` remains the same as it was initially.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` is greater than 0; `k` is an integer; `s` is \((\text{previous } n + 1)\); `m` is 4; `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.
