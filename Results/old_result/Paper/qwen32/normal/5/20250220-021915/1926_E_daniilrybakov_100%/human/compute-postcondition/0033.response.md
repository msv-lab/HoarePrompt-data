The `while` loop condition given is `while n:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `n` is not zero (i.e., `n` is truthy).

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer from input
- `k` is the second integer from input
- `s` is 0
- `m` is 1

The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we need to ensure that `n` is not zero for the loop to execute.

Therefore, `n` must be a non-zero integer. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t - 1 \leq 5 \times 10^4\); `n` must be a non-zero integer; `k` is the second integer from input; `s` is 0; `m` is 1**
