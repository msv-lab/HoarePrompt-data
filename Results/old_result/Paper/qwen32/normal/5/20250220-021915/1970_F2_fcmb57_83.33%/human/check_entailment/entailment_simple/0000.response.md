### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect `func_1` Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to move a player based on the movement direction provided.
   - However, the function is incorrectly defined in the comments as `return (2a, 2b)`, which is not what the function actually does. The function correctly returns `(x + dx, y + dy)`, which is the correct movement logic.
   - In the code, `func_1` is called correctly with the player's current position and the movement direction, so this part is correct.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Catch Action:**
   - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is incorrect. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player who caught the Quaffle to `quidditch[1]`.
   - The current implementation does nothing and always evaluates to `False`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Throw Action:**
   - The code checks if the player is in a red goal and then increments `pointsb` (blue points), and vice versa. This is correct.
   - However, the code incorrectly sets `quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]` when a player scores in their own goal. It should always set `quidditch[0]` to `middle` after a goal is scored, regardless of which team scored.
   - The logic for setting `quidditch[0]` should be simplified to always move the Quaffle to the middle after a goal is scored.

4. **Incorrect Player Elimination Handling:**
   - The code correctly identifies and eliminates players who come into contact with the Bludger.
   - However, the code does not handle the case where multiple players are eliminated simultaneously. The problem statement requires that if multiple players are eliminated at the same time, the events must be written in alphabetical order: B0, ..., B9, R0, ... R9. The current code does not guarantee this order.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect handling of the catch action and the incorrect setting of the Quaffle's position after a goal, the program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: **False**
