To determine the output state after executing `func_6()`, we need to understand what `func_6()` does. However, since the function `func_6()` is not defined in the provided context, we can only infer that it will modify the state of the program in some way. Since the function is not provided, we cannot determine the specific changes it will make to the variables or the program state.

Given that there is no additional information about `func_6()`, we can only assume that `func_6()` could potentially modify the state of the program, but we do not have enough information to specify how `test_cases` or any other variables might be affected.

Thus, the output state can only be described in terms of the precondition, assuming no changes are made to `test_cases` unless `func_6()` explicitly modifies it.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4**.
