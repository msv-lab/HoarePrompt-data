To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the range of possible values for `test_cases` and how the loop executes based on that value.

The loop `for _ in range(test_cases): func_6()` will execute `func_6()` exactly `test_cases` times. Given the initial state, `test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. 

The output state after each iteration of the loop only describes the condition that must be true for the loop to have executed that many times, not the state of `test_cases` itself. Since the loop runs `test_cases` times, the final output state will be determined by the fact that the loop has completed all its iterations.

Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is simply that `test_cases` iterations of `func_6()` have been completed, and `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` iterations of `func_6()` have been completed, and `test_cases` remains unchanged.**
