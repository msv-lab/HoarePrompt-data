Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges, with the first tuple removed; `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated to reflect the new root of the merged set in the DSU structure after the union operation; `_min_edge` is assigned the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`; `node_u` is equal to `u`; `node_v` is equal to `v`.**

In simple terms, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the variable `node_v` is now assigned the value of `v`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
