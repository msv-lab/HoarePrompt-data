You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Output hints for function number 8 : The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It performs a number of iterations equal to the value returned by `func_1()`, where each iteration calls `func_6()`. The function returns the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 10,000.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge in an undirected weighted graph. There are several issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Union-Find Implementation**: The `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) class is not defined in the provided code, which is crucial for the Kruskal's algorithm part of the solution. Without this class, the program will throw an error.

2. **Incorrect Cycle Detection**: The program attempts to find a cycle by sorting edges in descending order of weight and then using a union-find structure to detect cycles. However, the logic for finding the cycle after detecting a cycle with the minimum weight edge is flawed. The program does not correctly backtrack to find the cycle once it identifies the edge that forms a cycle.

3. **DFS for Cycle Extraction**: The DFS function (`dfs`) is supposed to extract the cycle starting from the node where the cycle was detected, but the implementation is incorrect. It does not correctly handle the backtracking to find the full cycle.

4. **Edge Handling**: The program sorts edges in descending order of weight, but it should be sorted in ascending order to correctly find the minimum weight edge in a cycle.

5. **Cycle Validation**: The program does not validate that the extracted path is indeed a cycle or that it includes the minimum weight edge correctly.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
4 1 4
```
The correct output should be:
```
1 4
1 2 3 4
```
However, the provided program might not correctly identify this cycle or might not handle the edge weights properly.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Sort edges in ascending order of weight**.
2. **Use Kruskal's algorithm** to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) and detect cycles.
3. **Extract the cycle** that includes the minimum weight edge correctly.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
