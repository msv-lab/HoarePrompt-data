To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to understand the values and meanings of the variables `_min_edge` and `res` based on the provided initial state.

1. **_min_edge**: This variable holds the information about the edge with the minimum weight in the last merged component of the graph. Since the graph is fully connected if possible, `_min_edge` will be the edge with the smallest weight that was added last to connect the graph, or it could be the smallest edge in the final connected component. However, without specific details about the graph and the edges, we can only describe it as the minimum weight edge in the last merged component.

2. **res**: This variable holds the result of a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the graph. The DFS result typically includes information about the nodes visited during the traversal. Since the graph is fully connected, the DFS traversal would visit all nodes in the graph. The length of `res` (`len(res)`) would then be the number of nodes in the graph.

Given this information, the print statement will output the minimum weight edge from the last merged component and the number of nodes in the graph.

Output: **_min_edge (where _min_edge is the edge with the minimum weight in the last merged component), len(res) (where len(res) is the number of nodes in the graph)**
