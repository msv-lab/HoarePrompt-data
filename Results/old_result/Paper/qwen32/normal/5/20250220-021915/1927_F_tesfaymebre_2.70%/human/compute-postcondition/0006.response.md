To determine the Output State, we need to understand what the function `func_6()` does. However, since the code snippet for `func_6()` is not provided, we can only assume that `func_6()` does not modify the variable `test_cases` based on the information given. Therefore, `test_cases` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 <= `test_cases` <= 10^4.**
This means that the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged after the execution of `func_6()`.
