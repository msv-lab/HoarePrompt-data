Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal and now includes `curr` as its last element, and the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is 2. The function returns a path containing `node_v` if found, or `None` if no such path is found after exploring all neighbors.**

In simpler terms, the color of the current vertex `curr` has been changed to 2, while all other variables remain unchanged.
