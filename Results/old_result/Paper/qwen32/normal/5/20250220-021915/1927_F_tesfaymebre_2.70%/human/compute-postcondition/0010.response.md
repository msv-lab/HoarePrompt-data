Output State: **The program returns `res`, which is the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`. `res` is not empty and contains the element `node_v`.**

This means that the function returns a list `res` that includes at least one element `node_v`. The list `res` is the result of a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from the neighbor `nei` of the current vertex `curr`, with `curr` as the parent, and the current path including `curr`.
