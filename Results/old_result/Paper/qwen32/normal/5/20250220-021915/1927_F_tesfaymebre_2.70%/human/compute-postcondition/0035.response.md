The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` method typically merges the sets containing nodes `u` and `v` and may update the parent pointers in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. Given that `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, the union operation will connect these two sets.

Since the exact implementation of the `dsu.union` method isn't provided, we'll assume it performs a standard union operation, possibly with union by rank or size, which could update the parent pointers and possibly the rank or size of the sets.

Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` is now the root parent of both `u` and `v` (assuming `u`'s set is larger or equal in rank/size); `parent_v` is now pointing to `parent_u` (or vice versa, depending on the implementation details of the union operation).**

In simple terms, after the union operation, `u` and `v` are now part of the same set, and their root parents are unified. The specific details of which parent pointer (`parent_u` or `parent_v`) gets updated depend on the union operation's implementation, but they will point to the same root parent.
