The provided Python code snippet initializes a list named `colors` with `0` values, with the length of the list being `n + 1`. This means that `colors` will have `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`.

The variables `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` are not affected by this code snippet. They retain their previous values, which are related to the edge with the minimum weight in the last merged component of the graph.

Output State: **All edges have been processed, and the graph is fully connected if possible. The DSU structure reflects the connected components of the graph. The variables `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` hold the information about the edge with the minimum weight in the last merged component. The `colors` list is initialized with `n + 1` zeros.**
