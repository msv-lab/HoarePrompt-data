Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal and now includes `curr` as its last element, and the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is 1.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal and now includes `curr` as its last element, and the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is 1. `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor. If `nei` is a neighbor of `curr` such that the color of `nei` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then `res` is assigned the result of the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, and `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. The condition `res and node_v in set_res` is false, meaning either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`. If `nei` does not meet the condition (`colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`), no changes are made to `res` or `set_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal and now includes `curr` as its last element, the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]` that meets the conditions (`colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`). If `colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`, `res` is the result returned by the recursive call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, and `set_res` is a set created from the result `res`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything. If `colors[nei] == 2` or `nei == parent`, the function does not execute the if block and does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list of integers representing the current path taken in the DFS traversal and now includes `curr` as its last element, the color of the current vertex (`colors[curr]`) is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, and `nei` is `next_nei`, where `next_nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in `graph[curr]` that meets the conditions (`colors[next_nei] != 2` and `next_nei != parent`). If `colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`, the `dfs` function is called with `nei` as the current vertex, `curr` as the parent vertex, and the updated `path`. The result `res` from the `dfs` function is converted to a set `set_res`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the program returns `res`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
