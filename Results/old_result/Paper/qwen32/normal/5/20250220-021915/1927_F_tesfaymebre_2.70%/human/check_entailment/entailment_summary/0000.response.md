### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify that it meets the problem description and the constraints given. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of vertices) and `m` (number of edges) using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the edges and constructs a graph and a list of edges using `func_3()`.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is stored as an adjacency list.
   - The edges are stored in a list and sorted in descending order based on their weights. This is done to process the heaviest edges first.

3. **Finding the Minimal Weight Edge in a Cycle**:
   - A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - The program iterates through the sorted edges and uses the DSU to find cycles.
   - When a cycle is detected (i.e., two vertices are already connected), the edge is added to the DSU, and the minimum weight edge in the component is updated.
   - The program keeps track of the minimum weight edge found in any cycle and the corresponding edge's vertices.

4. **Cycle Detection and Path Reconstruction**:
   - Once the minimal weight edge in a cycle is identified, a DFS (`dfs` function) is performed starting from one of the vertices of this edge.
   - The DFS function is used to find the cycle that includes the identified edge.
   - The DFS function uses a `colors` array to mark the state of each vertex during the traversal. It returns the path that includes the specific node `node_v`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the weight of the minimal edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then outputs the vertices in the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues and Corrections:

- **DFS Function**: The DFS function as provided does not correctly reconstruct the cycle. The condition `if res and node_v in set_res` is incorrect because `node_v` is not defined within the scope of `dfs`. Instead, the DFS should track the path and detect when it revisits a node that is part of the cycle.
- **Cycle Reconstruction**: The DFS function should correctly identify and return the cycle. This can be done by tracking the path and detecting when a node revisits a previously visited node in the same traversal.

### Correctness:

Given the issues with the DFS function, the program does not correctly reconstruct the cycle and may not output the correct cycle as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
