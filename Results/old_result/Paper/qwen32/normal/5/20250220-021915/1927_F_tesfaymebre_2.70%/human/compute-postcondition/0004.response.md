Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 0 < `test_cases` <= 10^4**

Explanation: The function `func_6()` is called, but its implementation is not provided or described in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the impact of `func_6()` on the variable `test_cases` or any other variables. As a result, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged.
