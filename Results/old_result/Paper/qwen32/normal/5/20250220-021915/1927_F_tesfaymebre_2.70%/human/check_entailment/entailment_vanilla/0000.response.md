Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`.
   - It then reads `m` edges, each consisting of two vertices and a weight.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is stored as an adjacency list using a `defaultdict` of lists.
   - A list `edges` is also maintained to keep track of all edges along with their weights.

3. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This is a critical step because the program later tries to find cycles by considering edges from the heaviest to the lightest.

4. **Union-Find Data Structure:**
   - A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure is used to detect cycles.
   - The DSU keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.

5. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles.
   - If adding an edge connects two vertices that are already in the same component, a cycle is detected.
   - The edge that closes the cycle is recorded if its weight is less than the previously recorded minimum weight of the edge in any detected cycle.

6. **DFS for Cycle Extraction:**
   - Once a cycle is detected, the program performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from one of the vertices of the detected cycle.
   - The DFS is used to extract the vertices that form the cycle.
   - The DFS ensures that the cycle is simple by avoiding revisiting vertices.

7. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program outputs the minimum weight of the edge in the detected cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also outputs the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Sorting Edges in Descending Order:**
  - Sorting edges in descending order of their weights is not necessary for finding the cycle with the minimum weight of its lightest edge. This could lead to incorrect results because it might miss the cycle with the smallest lightest edge.
  - A more appropriate approach would be to sort edges in ascending order and then use a DSU to find the first cycle that forms.

- **Cycle Detection Logic:**
  - The program correctly uses the DSU to detect cycles and records the edge that closes the cycle.
  - However, due to the incorrect sorting of edges, the detected cycle might not have the minimum weight of its lightest edge.

- **DFS for Cycle Extraction:**
  - The DFS correctly extracts the vertices of the detected cycle.

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical flaw in the sorting of edges, which affects the correctness of the solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
