Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list of tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two nodes it connects, sorted in descending order by the weight of the edges; `parent_u` is the root parent of node `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method; `parent_v` is the root parent of node `v` as determined by the `dsu.find(v)` method; `(w, u, v)` is the next edge in the `edges` list.**

Explanation: The value of `parent_u` is updated to be the root parent of node `u` as determined by the `dsu.find(u)` method. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
