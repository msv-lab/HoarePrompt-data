To determine what will be printed by the `print(*res)` statement, we need to understand the context and the state of the variable `res` as described in the initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **Graph Processing**: All edges have been processed, and the graph is fully connected if possible.
2. **DSU Structure**: The DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure reflects the connected components of the graph.
3. **Minimum Edge Information**: The variables `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v` hold the information about the edge with the minimum weight in the last merged component.
4. **Colors List**: The `colors` list is updated to reflect visited nodes.
5. **DFS Result**: The variable `res` holds the result of the DFS (Depth-First Search).

### Analysis:
- The `res` variable is the result of a DFS traversal of the graph. DFS typically returns a list of nodes that were visited in the order they were visited.
- Since the graph is fully connected (assuming it was possible to connect all nodes), the DFS will visit all nodes in the graph starting from an arbitrary node and will return a list of all nodes in the order they were visited.

### Output Description:
- The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, which contains the nodes visited during the DFS traversal. The `*` operator unpacks the list and prints each element separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Since the exact nodes and their order in the DFS traversal are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the nodes visited. However, we can infer that the output will be a space-separated list of all nodes in the graph.

Output: **node1 node2 node3 ... nodeN (where node1, node2, ..., nodeN are the nodes in the graph visited during the DFS traversal)**
