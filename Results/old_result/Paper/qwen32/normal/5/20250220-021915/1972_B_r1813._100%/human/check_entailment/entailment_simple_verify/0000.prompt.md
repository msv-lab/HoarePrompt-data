You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.

    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):

    #State: `data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is 0, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `n` and `s` are undefined since the loop has finished executing, and `count_u` is undefined since the loop has finished executing. The loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the number of 'U's in the respective strings `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem description.

### Program Analysis

The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it counts the number of facing-up coins ('U') in the string `s`. If the count of 'U' is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This decision is based on the observation that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner when both players play optimally.

### Key Points

1. **Parity of 'U' Coins**: The core logic is that if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.
2. **Optimal Play**: The problem states that both players play optimally. It can be shown that the parity of 'U' coins is the decisive factor in the game's outcome.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Coin**: If there is only one coin, the parity rule still holds.
   - **Two Coins**: The rule also applies when there are two coins.
   - **No Coins**: The rule indirectly handles the case where no coins are left.

### Verification

Let's verify the program against the provided examples and some edge cases:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `5 UUDUD`
   - Count of 'U': 3 (odd)
   - Output: `YES` (Alice wins)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `5 UDDUD`
   - Count of 'U': 2 (even)
   - Output: `NO` (Bob wins)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2 UU`
   - Count of 'U': 2 (even)
   - Output: `NO` (Bob wins)

4. **Edge Case 1**:
   - Input: `1 U`
   - Count of 'U': 1 (odd)
   - Output: `YES` (Alice wins)

5. **Edge Case 2**:
   - Input: `1 D`
   - Count of 'U': 0 (even)
   - Output: `NO` (Bob wins)

6. **Edge Case 3**:
   - Input: `2 UD`
   - Count of 'U': 1 (odd)
   - Output: `YES` (Alice wins)

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the number of 'U' coins. The logic holds for all the provided examples and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**

The program follows the problem description for every potential case and works as expected.
