The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is a positive integer, `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is `data[2]`.
