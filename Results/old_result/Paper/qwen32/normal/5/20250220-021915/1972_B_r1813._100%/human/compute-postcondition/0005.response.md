Output State: **`data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**

In simple terms, `data` remains the same list, `t` remains the positive integer, `index` remains 1, and `n` is now the integer value of the element at position `index` (which is 1) in the `data` list.
