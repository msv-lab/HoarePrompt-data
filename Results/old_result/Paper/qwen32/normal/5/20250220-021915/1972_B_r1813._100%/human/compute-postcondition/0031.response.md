Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D", where "U" indicates a coin facing up and "D" indicates a coin facing down. The function returns the number of pairs of adjacent coins that are facing in the same direction.**
