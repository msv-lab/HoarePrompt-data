Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`.
2. `t` is a positive integer minus 1.
3. `index` is 7.
4. `n` is the integer value of `data[5]`.
5. `s` is `data[6]`.
6. `count_u` is the number of 'U's in `s`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'NO'`. The values of the variables `data`, `t`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u` are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'NO'`.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
