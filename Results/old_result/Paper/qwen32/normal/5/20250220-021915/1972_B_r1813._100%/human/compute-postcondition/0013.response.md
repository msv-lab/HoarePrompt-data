Postcondition: **`data` is a list where the first element is a string representation of a positive integer `t`, `t` is a positive integer, `index` is 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `s` is `data[2]`, and `count_u` is the number of 'U's in `s`. If `count_u` is odd, then the current value of `count_u` is odd. Otherwise, `count_u` is even.**
