### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
3. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, an integer `n` representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers representing the array elements.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

#### Solution Analysis:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
2. **Beauty Calculation**: After sorting, it calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` simplifies to `array[i] - array[i - 1]`.
3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` reads all input data at once, processes each test case, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

#### Correctness Verification:
- **Sorting for Maximum Beauty**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty. This is because the smallest element will be next to the second smallest, the second smallest next to the third smallest, and so on, maximizing the differences.
- **Handling Input and Output**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases, processes each one, and outputs the results as required.

#### Annotations:
- **State of the program right before the function call in `func_1`**: The array is a list of integers with length `n` such that `2 <= n <= 100`, and each integer `a_i` in the array satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
- **State after sorting in `func_1`**: The array is a sorted list of integers with the same constraints, and `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in the array.
- **State of the program right before the function call in `func_2`**: Similar constraints as `func_1`.
- **State after processing all test cases in `func_2`**: The `results` list contains the beauty values for each test case, and these results are printed.

#### Evaluation:
The annotations confirm that the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty correctly. The original assessment is accurate because:
- Sorting the array maximizes the beauty.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the results as required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array for each test case by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.
