The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not represent any state that needs to be adjusted. However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`, which is the number of iterations the loop will perform. 

Given that `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 at the start of each iteration to reflect the number of remaining iterations.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1
- `index` is `2 + n`
- `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)`
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
- `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`

At the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining iterations.

State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be at least 0, `index` is `2 + n`, `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**
