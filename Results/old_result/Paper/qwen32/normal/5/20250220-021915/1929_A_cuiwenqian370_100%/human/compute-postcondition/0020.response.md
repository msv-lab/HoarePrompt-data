The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be at least 0; `index` is `3 + n + n`; `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)` and the newly appended `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**
