Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` (not applicable as the loop has finished); `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be 0; `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`; `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`; `n` is not applicable as the loop has finished; `result` is not applicable as the loop has finished.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1, `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`, `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`, `result` is not applicable as the loop has finished

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 2, `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + 1`, `results` is a list containing 2 `result` values from `func_1(array)`, `result` is the second-to-last element in `results`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is 2, `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + 1`, `results` is a list containing at least 3 `result` values from `func_1(array)`, `result` is the last element in `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
