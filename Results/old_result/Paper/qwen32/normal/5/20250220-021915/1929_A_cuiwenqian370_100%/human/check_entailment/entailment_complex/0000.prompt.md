Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each integer a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: `array` is a sorted list of integers with length `n` such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and each integer `a_i` in the `array` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in the `array`.
    return beauty
    #The program returns beauty, which is the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted list `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, sorts it, and returns the sum of the absolute differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` (not applicable as the loop has finished); `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be 0; `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`; `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`; `n` is not applicable as the loop has finished; `result` is not applicable as the loop has finished.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 3, `index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`, `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`, `result` is not applicable as the loop has finished
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it computes a result using the function `func_1` and prints the result. The function does not return any value directly but outputs the results of each test case.
