Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1; `index` is `2 + n`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`.**

In natural language: The variable `result` is now assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with `array` as its argument. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
