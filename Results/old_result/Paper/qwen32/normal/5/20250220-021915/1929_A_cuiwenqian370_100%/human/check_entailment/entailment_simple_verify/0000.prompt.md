You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0

    return beauty

    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.
- **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (length of the array) and `n` integers representing the array elements.
- **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(array)`**: Sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. **`func_2()`**: Reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

### Correctness of `func_1(array)`:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the array in ascending order ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array is minimized, and thus the absolute difference is maximized.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is calculated correctly as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Correctness of `func_2()`:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the results correctly.
- **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads the array, calls `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty, and stores the result.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`
   - Output: `2`
2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - Sorted Array: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
   - Output: `0`
3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted Array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57`
   - Output: `57`
4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted Array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`
   - Output: `1`
5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1`

The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty for each test case as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem description for all provided examples and potential cases. The logic used in `func_1` to sort the array and calculate the beauty is correct, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases accurately.

Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program sorts each array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which correctly maximizes the beauty as per the problem description. The input handling and output for multiple test cases are also correctly implemented.
