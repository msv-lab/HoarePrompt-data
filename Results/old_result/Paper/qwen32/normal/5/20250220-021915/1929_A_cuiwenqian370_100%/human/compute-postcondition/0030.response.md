To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information step-by-step:

1. **`data` is a list of strings**: This provides the type and content of `data`, but the specific strings are not given.
2. **`t` is 2**: This gives us the value of `t`.
3. **`index` is `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + 1`**: This formula defines `index` in terms of `n1`, `n2`, ..., `nt`. Since `t` is 2, we have `index = 2 + sum(n1, n2) + 1`. The exact values of `n1` and `n2` are not provided, so we can't determine the exact value of `index`.
4. **`results` is a list containing 2 `result` values from `func_1(array)`**: This tells us that `results` is a list of two elements, each of which is a `result` from the function `func_1` applied to some `array`.
5. **`result` is the second-to-last element in `results`**: Since `results` contains two elements, the second-to-last element is actually the first element. Therefore, `result = results[0]`.

Given this, the `print(result)` statement will print the first element of the `results` list. However, since we do not have the specific values returned by `func_1(array)`, we can only describe it in terms of the list `results`.

Output: **result (where result is the first element of the `results` list)**
