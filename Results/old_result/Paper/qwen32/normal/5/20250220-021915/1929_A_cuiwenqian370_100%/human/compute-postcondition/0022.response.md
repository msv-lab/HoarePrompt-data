The provided code snippet updates the `array` variable by mapping the elements of the slice `data[index:index + n]` to integers. This means that `array` now holds the integer values of the strings in the specified slice of `data`.

Given the initial state, we know that:
- `array` was initially a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `t` is an integer calculated as the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be at least 0.
- `index` is `3 + n + n + 1` which simplifies to `3 + 2n + 1` or `4 + 2n`.
- `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)` and the newly appended `result`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.
- `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`.

After the code snippet is executed, `array` is reassigned to the list of integers obtained from the slice `data[index:index + n]`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be at least 0; `index` is `4 + 2n`; `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)` and the newly appended `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**.
