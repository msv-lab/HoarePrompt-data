### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Problem Recap:
- **Objective**: Maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.
- **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (length of the array) and `n` integers representing the array elements.
- **Output**: For each test case, output the maximum beauty of the array.

#### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(array)`**: Sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. **`func_2()`**: Reads input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Correctness of `func_1(array)`:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the array in ascending order does not necessarily maximize the beauty. Instead, the maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the elements in either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order. Sorting alone does not guarantee this.
- **Beauty Calculation**: The beauty is calculated correctly as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, sorting does not ensure the maximum beauty.

#### Correctness of `func_2()`:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the results correctly.
- **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads the array, calls `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty, and stores the result.

#### Verification:
Let's consider the examples provided:
1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `2 1 3`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`
   - Output: `2` (Correct, but sorting alone might not always yield the maximum beauty.)
2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `3`, `69 69 69`
   - Sorted Array: `[69, 69, 69]`
   - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)
3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `5`, `100 54 80 43 90`
   - Sorted Array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
   - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 57`
   - Output: `57` (Correct, but sorting alone might not always yield the maximum beauty.)
4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `4`, `3 4 3 3`
   - Sorted Array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct, but sorting alone might not always yield the maximum beauty.)
5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `2`, `2 1`
   - Sorted Array: `[1, 2]`
   - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct, but sorting alone might not always yield the maximum beauty.)

While the program correctly calculates the beauty for the given examples, the logic used in `func_1` to sort the array and calculate the beauty is not guaranteed to maximize the beauty in all cases. The maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the elements in a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order, which might not be the same as sorting the array.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always ensure the maximum beauty of the array. Sorting the array does not guarantee the maximum beauty, as the maximum beauty can be achieved by arranging the elements in a different order.

**Final: False**
