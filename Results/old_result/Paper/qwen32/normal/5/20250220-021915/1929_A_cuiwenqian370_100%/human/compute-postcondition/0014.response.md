The code snippet provided increments the variable `index` by 1. The other variables (`array`, `data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `result`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `index`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 1 and must be at least 0, `index` is `3 + n`, `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[2 + n]`, `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**.
