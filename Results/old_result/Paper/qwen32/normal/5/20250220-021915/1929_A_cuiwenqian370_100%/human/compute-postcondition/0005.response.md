The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The current state mentions that `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`, so we need to ensure that this value is at least 1.

The other variables (`array`, `data`, `index`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input such that the integer value of the first element is at least 1; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list**
