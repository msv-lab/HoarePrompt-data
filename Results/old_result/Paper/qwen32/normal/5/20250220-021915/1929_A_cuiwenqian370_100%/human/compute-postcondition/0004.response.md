The code snippet provided initializes an empty list named `results`. The other variables (`array`, `data`, `t`, and `index`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers with length n such that 2 <= n <= 100, and each element a_i in the array satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
