Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` minus 2 and must be at least 0; `index` is `3 + n + n + 1`; `results` is a list containing the `result` from `func_1(array)` and the newly appended `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `result` is the output of `func_1(array)`**

In simple terms, the `index` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `3 + n + n + 1`. The values of `array`, `data`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged.
