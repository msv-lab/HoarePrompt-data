The code snippet `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Given the initial state, `index` is 2 and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`. Therefore, the new value of `index` will be `2 + n`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`; `data` is a list of strings; `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1; `index` is `2 + n`; `results` is an empty list; `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.**
