Let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `data` is a list of strings.
2. `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1.
3. `index` is calculated as `2 + sum(n1, n2, ..., nt) + (t - 1)`, where `n1, n2, ..., nt` are presumably integers derived from the list `data`.
4. `results` is a list containing `t` `result` values from `func_1(array)`.
5. `result` is "not applicable" as the loop has finished.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `result` is explicitly stated to be "not applicable" after the loop has finished.
- The `print(result)` statement will directly print the value of `result`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(result)` statement will print "not applicable" as per the given initial state.

Output: **not applicable**
