Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing `n` characters. Each character in `template` is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the character in `b` at the same position, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match. If either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `template[i]` (ignoring case), `match_a_b` is set to False and `template[i]` is an uppercase character, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True.**
