Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is `False` if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` when `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_a_b` retains its original value. `match_c` is `False` if the lowercase version of the character at index `i` of `c` is equal to the lowercase version of the character at index `i` of `template` when `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, otherwise `match_c` retains its original value. `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.**
