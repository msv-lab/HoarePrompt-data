The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` should be increased by 1 more to reflect the start of the next iteration. The condition `n` is greater than `i + 1` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

Let's adjust the state:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so `i` is now some value, let's call it `i_end`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end + 1`.
- The condition `n > i + 1` must hold true, so `n` must be greater than `i_end + 2`.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1**

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be `x + 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `(x + 1) + 1` or `x + 2`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1**

To make it clearer with a concrete example, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` would be 4, and `n` must be greater than 5.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1**

Given the general case:

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is incremented by 1**
