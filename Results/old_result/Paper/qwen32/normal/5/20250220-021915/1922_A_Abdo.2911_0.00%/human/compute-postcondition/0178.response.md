Output State: **`a` is the new input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, or `match_a_b` is False or `match_c` is True; `t` is `t - 1` and is still greater than 0; `n` is the integer value provided by the user input; `b` is the new input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `c` is the newly input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from the old `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to n-1.`**

In simpler terms, the value of `c` has been updated to the newly input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, while all other variables retain their previous values.
