Postcondition: **`template` is a list, `i` is 3, `n` is unchanged. If `template[i]` is lowercase and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or if `template[i]` is not lowercase and `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `match_c` remains unchanged.**
