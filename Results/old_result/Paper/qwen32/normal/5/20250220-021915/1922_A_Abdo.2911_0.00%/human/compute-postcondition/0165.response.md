Output State: **`match_a_b` will be False if any of the conditions mentioned above are met at any iteration. Otherwise, it will remain True. `match_c` is False. `t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `template` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement.
