Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character, and `i` is 1. If `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
