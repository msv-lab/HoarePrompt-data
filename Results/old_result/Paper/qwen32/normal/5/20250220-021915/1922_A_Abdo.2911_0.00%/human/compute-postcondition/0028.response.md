Postcondition: **`t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing `n` characters. Each character in `template` is either the corresponding character from `a` if it matches the character in `b` at the same position, or the uppercase version of the character from `a` if it does not match. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is False and the current character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains True.**
