The code snippet assigns an integer value to the variable `n` based on the user's input. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged, and the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The output state will include the newly assigned value of `n` and the unchanged values of `match_a_b` and `match_c`.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.
