Output State: **`match_a_b` will be False if any of the conditions mentioned above are met at any iteration. Otherwise, it will remain True. `match_c` is False if `c[i]` does not match `template[i]` (case-sensitive for lowercase `template[i]` and case-insensitive for uppercase `template[i]`) for any `i` in the range of `n`. `t` is greater than 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input strings with leading/trailing whitespace removed; `template` is a list containing the characters from `a` (or their uppercase versions if they do not match the corresponding characters in `b`) up to the nth character; `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to n-1.**

In simpler terms: After the loop has finished all its iterations, `match_a_b` remains True unless any condition that sets it to False was met. `match_c` will be False if at any point during the loop, `c[i]` did not match `template[i]` according to the specified rules. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `template` remain unchanged as per their initial conditions, and `i` has gone through all iterations from 0 to n-1.
