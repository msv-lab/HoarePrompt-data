The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the last element that was processed, and `n` is the total number of elements to process. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

To be more precise, if `i` was `x` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `x + 1` and `n` must be greater than `x + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`**

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can represent the state in terms of `i` as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1**
