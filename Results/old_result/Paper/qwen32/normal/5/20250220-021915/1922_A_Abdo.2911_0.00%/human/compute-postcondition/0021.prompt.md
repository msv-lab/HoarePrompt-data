Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the new integer value provided by the user, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        template.append(a[i])
    else:
        template.append(a[i].upper())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a specific integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` is a list containing the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `template` is a list containing the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a specific integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `template` has an additional character. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` includes the character `a[i]`. Otherwise, `template` includes the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `template` has an additional character. If `a[4]` is equal to `b[4]`, `template` includes the character `a[4]`. Otherwise, `template` includes the uppercase version of `a[4]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
