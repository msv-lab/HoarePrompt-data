The only variable in the loop head is `i` and the range `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The state of `a`, `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `t`, `b`, `c`, `template`, and the previous iterations of `i` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, so they do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `n` to be greater than 0. The value of `i` before the loop starts does not matter because it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
