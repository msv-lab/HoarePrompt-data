### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Template Construction:**
   - For each position `i` in the strings `a` and `b`, the program constructs a template character:
     - If `a[i] == b[i]`, the template character is set to `a[i]` (lowercase).
     - If `a[i] != b[i]`, the template character is set to the uppercase version of `a[i]`.
   
   This ensures that if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, they must match the template at that position (because the template is the same lowercase letter). If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, they must match the template at that position only if the template character is an uppercase letter that differs from the lowercase version of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

2. **Matching `a` and `b` to the Template:**
   - The program then checks if both `a` and `b` match the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   
   If any position fails this check, `match_a_b` is set to `False`.

3. **Matching `c` to the Template:**
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must be equal to the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   
   If any position fails this check, `match_c` is set to `False`.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - The program prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template (`match_a_b` is `True`) and `c` does not match the template (`match_c` is `False`).
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic correctly constructs the template and checks the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if there exists a template that matches `a` and `b` but does not match `c`.

**Correctness: True**
