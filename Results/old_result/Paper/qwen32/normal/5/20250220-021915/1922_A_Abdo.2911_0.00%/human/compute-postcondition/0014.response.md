The code snippet provided is `template.append(a[i])`. This line appends the character `a[i]` to the list `template`. 

Based on the initial state, `template` already contains characters determined by the condition: if `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `template` contains `a[i]`; otherwise, it contains the uppercase version of `a[i]`. 

The new line of code simply adds another character `a[i]` to the end of the `template` list, regardless of the previous condition. 

The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `template`.

Output State: **`t` is a specific integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `template` is a list that now includes an additional character `a[i]` appended to it.**
