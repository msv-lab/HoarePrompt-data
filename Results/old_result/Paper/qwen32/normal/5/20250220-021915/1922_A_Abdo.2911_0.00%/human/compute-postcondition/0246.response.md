The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has already been incremented. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the value it was at the end of the previous iteration. Since `i` is incremented in the loop construct itself (`for i in range(n)`), we need to set `i` to the value it had before the increment for the next iteration to occur.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_end`. For the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end` before the increment happens in the loop construct. Additionally, `n` should remain the same as it determines the upper limit of the loop.

Since `match_c` is not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust it. However, for completeness, we note that `match_c` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` in the next iteration.

State: **`template` is a list, `i` is `i_end`, `n` is unchanged, `match_c` is to be recalculated**.

To be more specific, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 3, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3 before the loop increments it to 4.

State: **`template` is a list, `i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `match_c` is to be recalculated**.

However, since we do not have the specific value of `i_end`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`template` is a list, `i` is `i_end`, `n` is unchanged, `match_c` is to be recalculated**.

But typically, if we assume `i` was just incremented, we would say:

State: **`template` is a list, `i` is the value it was at the end of the previous iteration before the increment, `n` is unchanged, `match_c` is to be recalculated**.

For the sake of a concrete example, let's assume `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration:

State: **`template` is a list, `i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `match_c` is to be recalculated**.
