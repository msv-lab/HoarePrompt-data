The code snippet appends the character at index 1 of string `a` to the list `template`. The values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `b` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `c` is the input string with leading/trailing whitespace removed, `i` is 1, and `template` includes the character at index 1 of `a`.**
