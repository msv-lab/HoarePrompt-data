Postcondition: **`template` is a list, `i` is an index within the bounds of `template`, and the element at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter. If the element at index `i` in `c` is equal to the element at index `i` in `template` when both are converted to lowercase, `match_c` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to `match_c` and the loop or if statement continues.**
