The code snippet `template.append(a[i].upper())` appends the uppercase version of the character `a[i]` to the `template` string.

Given the initial state, `template` already has an additional character, and `a[i].upper()` will be appended to it. Therefore, the character at position `i` in string `a` will be converted to uppercase and added to `template`.

Since `i` is 4, `a[i]` refers to the 5th character of the string `a`. The uppercase version of this character is appended to `template`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is the string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string input provided by the user with no leading or trailing whitespace, and `template` has an additional character which is the uppercase version of `a[4]`.**
