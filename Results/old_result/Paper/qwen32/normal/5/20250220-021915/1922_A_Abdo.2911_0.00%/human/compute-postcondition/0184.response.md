The code snippet appends the uppercase version of the element at index `i` of list `a` to the `template` list. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. It only modifies the `template` list by adding a new element to it.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, and the element at index `i` of list `a` is not equal to the element at index `i` of list `b`; `template` has an additional element which is the uppercase version of `a[i]`.**
