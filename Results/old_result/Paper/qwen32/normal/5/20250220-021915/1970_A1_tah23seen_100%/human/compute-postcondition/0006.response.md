The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` increments the value of `d[i + 1]` by adding 1 to the value of `d[i]`. Given that `i` is initialized to a value such that `s[i]` is equal to "(", the value of `d[i]` is being used to determine the value of `d[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is initialized to a value such that `s[i]` is equal to "(", `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] + 1`.**
