You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `d` will be a dictionary with keys from `0` to `n` where `d[n]` is `0` and `d[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n-1` will be the cumulative count of opening parentheses minus closing parentheses up to that point.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is the concatenation of `s[i]` for all tuples `(i, j)` in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the concatenation of `s[i]` for all tuples `(i, j)` in `d`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the provided Python program and compare it with the problem statement to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: A balanced parentheses sequence `s` of length up to 500,000.
2. **Output**: The balanced shuffle of `s`.
3. **Steps**:
   - Compute the prefix balance for each character in the sequence.
   - Sort the characters based on their prefix balance in increasing order, and in case of ties, by position in decreasing order.
   - Form a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The input is read using `input()` and stored in `n`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n` as the argument.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - A dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is `'('`, the balance is incremented by 1.
   - If the character is `')'`, the balance is decremented by 1.
   - The balance at each position is stored in the dictionary `d`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted first by balance in increasing order and then by position in decreasing order using the `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the key.
   - The `pop(n)` operation removes the last balance value, which is unnecessary since the last balance is not needed for the final result.

4. **Reconstructing the Sequence**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted list of tuples `(i, j)`, where `i` is the position and `j` is the balance.
   - It appends the character at position `i` in the original sequence to the result string `ans`.

### Correctness Check:
- **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position.
- **Sorting**: The program sorts the positions based on the prefix balance and position as specified.
- **Reconstruction**: The program reconstructs the sequence from the sorted positions.

However, there is an issue with the program:
- The dictionary `d` is indexed with positions starting from 1, but when reconstructing the sequence, it uses `s[i]` which should be `s[i-1]` because Python uses 0-based indexing.

### Corrected Code Snippet:
```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i-1]  # Corrected index to i-1
    return ans
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect index in the reconstruction step). After correcting the index, the program would be correct.
