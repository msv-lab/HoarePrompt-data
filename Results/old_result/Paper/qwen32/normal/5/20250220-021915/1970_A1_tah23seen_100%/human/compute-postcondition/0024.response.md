Output State: **`d` is a list of tuples sorted by the cumulative count of opening parentheses minus closing parentheses (in ascending order), and by the keys (in descending order) in case of ties, and `d` contains at least one more tuple; `ans` is the previous value of `ans` with the character `s[i]` appended to it.**

In simple terms: The list `d` remains unchanged, still sorted by the specified criteria. The variable `ans` now includes the character `s[i]` appended to its previous value.
