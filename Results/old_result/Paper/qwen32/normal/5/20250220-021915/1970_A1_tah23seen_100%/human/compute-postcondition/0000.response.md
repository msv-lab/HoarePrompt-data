The variable `n` is assigned the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000, the value of `n` will be the exact number of characters in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**
