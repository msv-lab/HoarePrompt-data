The code snippet `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the value of `d` at index `i + 1` to be one more than the value of `d` at index `i`. The values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the code snippet. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `d[i + 1]` is `d[i] + 1`.**
