#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `d` will be a dictionary with keys from `0` to `n` where `d[n]` is `0` and `d[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n-1` will be the cumulative count of opening parentheses minus closing parentheses up to that point.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is the concatenation of `s[i]` for all tuples `(i, j)` in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the concatenation of `s[i]` for all tuples `(i, j)` in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string constructed by concatenating characters from `s` in a specific order based on the cumulative count of opening and closing parentheses up to each position in the string.
