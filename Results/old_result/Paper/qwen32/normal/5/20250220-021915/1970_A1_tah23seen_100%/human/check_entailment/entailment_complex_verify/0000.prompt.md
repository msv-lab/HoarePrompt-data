You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `d` will be a dictionary with keys from `0` to `n` where `d[n]` is `0` and `d[i]` for `i` from `1` to `n-1` will be the cumulative count of opening parentheses minus closing parentheses up to that point.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is the concatenation of `s[i]` for all tuples `(i, j)` in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the concatenation of `s[i]` for all tuples `(i, j)` in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string constructed by concatenating characters from `s` in a specific order based on the cumulative count of opening and closing parentheses up to each position in the string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it constructs the balanced shuffle. Specifically, the program sorts the positions based on the prefix balance and then constructs the new sequence by appending characters from the original sequence in the sorted order of positions. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will be balanced according to the problem's definition.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

Input: `((()))`

The program will generate the following prefix balances and positions:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1| 0  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7  
Character| (| (| (| )| )| )| )  

After sorting by prefix balance and breaking ties by position in decreasing order, the table will be:

Prefix balance| 0| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 7| 2| 6| 3| 4| 5| 8| 4  
Character| (| )| (| )| (| )| )| )| )  

The resulting sequence constructed by the program will be: `()((()))`

However, this sequence is not balanced according to the problem's definition because the balance of the prefix `(()` is 1, but the next character is `(`, which would make the balance 2, and the next character is `(` again, making the balance 3, which is not a valid balanced sequence.

A correct approach would involve ensuring that the resulting sequence maintains a non-negative balance at every prefix and ends with a balance of 0, which the current program does not guarantee.
