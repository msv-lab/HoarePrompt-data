Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is 0; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is 0; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and 11111111`. If `start + 1 < len(lst)`, then `mini` is updated to `min(abs(lst[0] - lst[1]), 11111111)`. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**
