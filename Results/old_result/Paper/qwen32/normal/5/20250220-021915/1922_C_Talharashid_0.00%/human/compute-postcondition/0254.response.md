The code snippet provided reassigns `d1` to a new `defaultdict` with default integer value of 0. This means that all previous key-value pairs in `d1` are discarded, and `d1` is now an empty dictionary with the default value set to 0.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 2` down to `0` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is the first integer from the last input minus 1; `end` is the second integer from the last input minus 1; `inc` is `-1`; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is 0.**
