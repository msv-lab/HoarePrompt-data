Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 2` down to `0` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `start - 1`; `end` is `end - 1`; `inc` is `-1`; `m` must be greater than 0; `s` is the final cumulative sum after the loop.** 

The variable `end` has been decremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
