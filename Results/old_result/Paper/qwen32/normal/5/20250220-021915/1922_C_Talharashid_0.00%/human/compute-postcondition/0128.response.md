The provided code snippet is:

```python
d1 = defaultdict(int)
```

This line of code reinitializes `d1` as a new `defaultdict` with default integer values of 0. This means that any previous key-value pairs in `d1` are lost, and `d1` is now an empty dictionary with the same default behavior.

Given the initial state, the variable `d1` was already a `defaultdict` with default integer values of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration. After executing the line `d1 = defaultdict(int)`, `d1` is reinitialized and no longer contains any of the previous keys and values.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, `m`, `s1`, `s2`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `0` with corresponding values of `s` after each iteration, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is the first input integer minus `m`, `end` is the second input integer minus `m`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed. If `start` is less than `end`, then `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.**
