The code snippet `d2 = defaultdict(int)` creates a new defaultdict `d2` with a default integer value of 0. This overwrites the previous `d2` which had keys from `len(lst) - 2` down to `0` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is the first integer from the last input minus 1; `end` is the second integer from the last input minus 1; `inc` is `-1`; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is 0.**
