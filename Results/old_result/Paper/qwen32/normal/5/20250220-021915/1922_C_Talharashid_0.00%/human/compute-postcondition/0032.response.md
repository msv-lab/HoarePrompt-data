The given code snippet updates the variable `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to it. The variables `t`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`, `lst`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, and `mini` remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the code.

Given the initial state, `s` is updated as follows:
- `s` becomes `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.

Since `inc` is 1, the expression simplifies to:
- `s` becomes `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`.

The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is less than `end`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and `mini` is updated to `min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains unchanged.**
