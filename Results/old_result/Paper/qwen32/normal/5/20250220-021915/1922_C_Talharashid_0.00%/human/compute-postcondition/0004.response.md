Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Natural Language: The variable `n` is assigned the value of an input integer, while the other variables `t`, `i`, `d1`, and `d2` remain unchanged.
