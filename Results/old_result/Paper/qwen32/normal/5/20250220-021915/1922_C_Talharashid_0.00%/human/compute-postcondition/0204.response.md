To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `start != end` remains true. The variables involved in this condition are `start` and `end`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 3`
- `end` is `0`

For the loop to execute one more time, `start` should not be equal to `end`. Since `end` is `0`, `start` should not be `0`. However, `start` is initialized to `len(lst) - 3`, which is greater than `0` as long as `len(lst) > 3`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that after the loop body executes, `start` will still not be equal to `end`. Given that `inc` is `-1` and `start` is decremented by `1` in each iteration (if the condition `start - 1 > -1` holds), we need to ensure that `start` remains greater than `end` after the next decrement.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `start` should be `1` to ensure it can be decremented to `0` in the next iteration, making `start != end` true for one more iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the loop condition.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and key `start` with value `s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `1`; `end` is `0`; `inc` is `-1`; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`. If `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged. `d2[start]` is updated to the current value of `s`.**
