The code snippet calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. None of the other variables are modified by this line of code.

Given the initial state, the only change is the introduction of `s2` with a calculated value.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from `len(lst) - 1` to `0` with corresponding values of `s` after each iteration, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `inc` is -1, `s` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, and `start` is less than `end`; `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`; `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`.**
