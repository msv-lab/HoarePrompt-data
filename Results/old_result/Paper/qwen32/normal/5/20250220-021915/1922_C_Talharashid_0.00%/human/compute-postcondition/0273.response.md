The code snippet provided increments the variable `s` by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `s`.

Given the initial state, `s` is initially 0. After the code snippet is executed, `s` will be updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `m` is the number of iterations; `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. If `start` is greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
