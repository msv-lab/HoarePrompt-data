To ensure that the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables involved in the loop condition. The loop condition is `start != end`, so we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is 0
- `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d2[start] = s`
- `n` is the new input integer
- `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`
- `start` is `len(lst) - 3`
- `end` is 0
- `inc` is -1
- `m` is the number of iterations
- `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.
- `s` is set based on certain conditions involving `mini` and differences in `lst`.

To make sure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `start` and `end` such that `start != end`. Since `end` is currently 0, we can adjust `start` to any value other than 0. Given that `start` is initially set to `len(lst) - 3`, we can ensure that `start` is not equal to 0 by not changing `end` from 0 and ensuring `start` remains `len(lst) - 3` (as long as `len(lst) > 3`).

If `len(lst) <= 3`, then `start` would be 0 or negative, which would mean the loop condition `start != end` is already false, and the loop would not execute. However, since the problem states `len(lst) > 1`, we assume `len(lst) > 3` for the loop to have a chance to execute.

Therefore, we do not need to change `start` and `end` from their current values as long as `len(lst) > 3`. If `len(lst) <= 3`, the loop would not execute again regardless of the values of `start` and `end`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 0; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes key-value pairs `d1[start] = s` for each `start` from 1 to `len(lst) - 1`; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and includes the key-value pair `d2[start] = s`; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 3`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is the number of iterations; `mini` is the minimum of its previous value and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged; `s` is incremented based on certain conditions involving `mini` and differences in `lst`.**
