Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with at least 2 elements; `start` is 0; `end` is `len(lst) - 1` which is at least 1; `inc` is 1; `s` is 0; `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed; `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and the previous value of `mini` if applicable; `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` in the current iteration; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`.**
