To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the loop head condition: `while start != end:`. 

The variables `start` and `end` are the only ones that affect whether the loop can execute. According to the initial state:
- `start` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `end` is `0`

For the loop to execute, `start` must not be equal to `end`. Since `start` is initialized to `len(lst) - 1` and `end` is initialized to `0`, the loop will execute as long as `len(lst) - 1` is not equal to `0`. This condition is satisfied if `len(lst)` is greater than `1`.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the variables `start` and `end` themselves because they are already set in a way that allows the loop to execute if `len(lst) > 1`. However, we need to ensure that `len(lst)` is indeed greater than `1` for the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `len(lst) - 1` with values corresponding to the cumulative sum `s` at each point; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input with `len(lst) > 1`; `start` is `len(lst) - 1`; `end` is 0; `inc` is -1; `m` is `len(lst) - 1`; `s` is 0; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`.**
