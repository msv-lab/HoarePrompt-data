You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t - 1` (indicating that the loop has completed all `t` iterations); `d1` and `d2` are default dictionaries that store cumulative sums `s` for each city when traversed from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively, for the last test case; `n` is the number of cities in the last test case; `lst` is the list of city positions for the last test case; `start` and `end` are the last indices used for the queries in the last test case; `inc` is -1 for the last traversal; `m` is the number of queries in the last test case; `s` is 0 for the last query.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives a list of city positions and a series of queries. Each query specifies two cities, and the function calculates and prints the minimum distance required to reach the closest city to the midpoint of the two specified cities.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities based on the given problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum coins to travel from one city to another using the closest city mechanism seems flawed.

Let's consider a simple example to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

The program's logic for calculating the minimum coins involves maintaining two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` which store the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city from the start to the end and vice versa. However, the way these costs are accumulated and used to compute the final answer is incorrect.

For instance, in the given example, the program might incorrectly calculate the cost for traveling from city 1 to city 4. The correct approach would involve determining the sequence of closest city moves and direct moves that yield the minimum cost, which the current implementation does not handle correctly.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Precompute the closest city for each city.
2. Use a more accurate method to calculate the minimum cost by considering both direct moves and sequences of closest city moves.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of why the current program might fail:
- The logic for updating the cumulative cost `s` in `d1` and `d2` is incorrect. It does not correctly reflect the cost of moving to the closest city.
- The calculation of `s1` and `s2` in the query handling part does not correctly account for the minimum cost path between two cities.

Thus, the given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
