The value of `inc` is changed from -1 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is `t-1`; `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and no keys; `n` is the new input integer; `lst` is a list of integers read from the input; `start` is 0; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `inc` is 1; `s` is 0; `m` is the total number of iterations that have been executed; `s1` and `s2` are as previously defined based on `start` and `end`.**
