The code snippet provided updates the variable `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to it. Given the initial state and the operation, here is the updated state:

The variable `s` is incremented by the value `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. Since `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `inc` is `-1`, the expression `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` is equivalent to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 1] - lst[len(lst) - 2])`. Therefore, `s` will be updated to its previous value plus this absolute difference.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0 and keys from 1 to `end` with values of `s` after each iteration, `d2` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `start` is `len(lst) - 1` (which is at least 1), `end` is `0`, `inc` is -1, `s` is `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, and `mini` is the minimum of `11111111` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `mini` remains `11111111`. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.**
