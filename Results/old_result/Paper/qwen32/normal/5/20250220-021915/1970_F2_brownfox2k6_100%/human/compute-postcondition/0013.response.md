Postcondition: **`t` is a non-negative integer representing the current time step, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `blud` is a pair of integers representing the current position of the Bludger on the field, `p` is the next player identifier in the `player` dictionary after the previous `p`. If `player[p]` equals `blud`, then the value for key `p` in `player` is updated to `[-1, -1]` and `out` is a list that includes the player identifier `p`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `player` or `out`.**
