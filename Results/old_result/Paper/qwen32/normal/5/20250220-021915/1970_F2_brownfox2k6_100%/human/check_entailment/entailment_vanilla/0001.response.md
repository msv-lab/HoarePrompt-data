Let's analyze the provided Python code to see if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Analysis

The provided code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but it does not seem to cover all the requirements of the problem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does and what it lacks:

#### Function 1: `func_1(obj, d)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to move an object (`obj`) in a specified direction (`d`).
- **Implementation**: It correctly modifies the coordinates of `obj` based on the direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
- **Issues**: This function alone does not handle the entire game logic, such as catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, scoring goals, or handling Bludger collisions.

#### Function 2: `func_2(t)`
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to check for Bludger collisions and eliminate players who collide with the Bludger.
- **Implementation**: It iterates over players, checks if their position matches the Bludger's position, and if so, marks the player as eliminated and prints the elimination message.
- **Issues**: This function does not handle the entire game logic, such as moving players, catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, or scoring goals.

### Missing Components
1. **Initialization**: The code does not initialize the game state, including the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
2. **Game Loop**: There is no game loop that processes each step and updates the game state accordingly.
3. **Handling Actions**: The code does not handle the actions specified in the input (e.g., moving, catching, throwing).
4. **Scoring**: The code does not keep track of the score or print the score at the end of the game.
5. **Printing Events**: The code does not print the events of the game as required (e.g., scoring goals).

### Conclusion
The provided code is incomplete and does not implement the full logic required to solve the problem. It only provides two functions that handle a small part of the game mechanics (moving and eliminating players due to Bludger collisions).

**Correctness: False**

The code is not correct because it lacks the necessary components to fully simulate the game and handle all the required actions and events.
