### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify if it meets the problem description:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the dimensions of the field (`n`, `m`).
   - It then reads the field and identifies the positions of the red goals (`rg`), blue goals (`bg`), the Quaffle (`ball`), the Bludger (`blud`), and all players (`player`).

2. **Game Steps:**
   - For each step, the program reads the entity performing the action and the action itself.
   - Depending on the action (`C` for catch, `T` for throw, `U` for up, `D` for down, `L` for left, `R` for right), the program updates the state of the game.
   - If a player catches the Quaffle, the variable `carry` is set to that player.
   - If a player throws the Quaffle, the `carry` variable is reset, and the program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If so, it updates the score and resets the Quaffle to the center of the field.
   - If the entity is the Quaffle or the Bludger, the program moves it accordingly.
   - If the entity is a player, the program moves the player and checks for elimination by the Bludger. If the player is carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle's position is updated to the player's position.
   - The function `func_1` handles the movement of entities.
   - The function `func_2` checks for player eliminations by the Bludger and prints the elimination message.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the score events and elimination events in the correct format.
   - At the end of the game, it prints the final score.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Movement:** The program correctly updates the positions of entities based on the given directions.
- **Catch and Throw:** The program correctly handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
- **Scoring:** The program correctly updates the score when the Quaffle is placed in a goal and resets the Quaffle to the center of the field.
- **Elimination:** The program correctly identifies and eliminates players who collide with the Bludger.
- **Output:** The program prints the required events and the final score in the correct format.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. All functions work together to simulate the game and provide the correct output based on the given input.

**Correctness: True**
