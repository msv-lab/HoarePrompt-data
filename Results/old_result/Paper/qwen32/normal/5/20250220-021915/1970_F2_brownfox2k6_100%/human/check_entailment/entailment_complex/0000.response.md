### Reasoning:

The provided Python program appears to correctly simulate the Quidditch match as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the functionality of the program and verify it against the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The dimensions of the field (N and M) are read.
   - The field is parsed to identify the positions of the goals (RG and BG), the Quaffle (Q), the Bludger (B), and the players (R0, R1, ..., B0, B1, ...).
   - Initial scores for both teams (red and blue) are set to 0.
   - A variable `carry` is used to keep track of which player (if any) is currently carrying the Quaffle.

2. **Processing Actions**:
   - For each action in the input, the program determines the entity performing the action and the action itself (U, D, L, R, C, T).
   - If the action is 'C', the player starts carrying the Quaffle.
   - If the action is 'T', the player stops carrying the Quaffle, and the program checks if the Quaffle is at a goal. If so, the appropriate team scores a point, and the Quaffle is moved to the center of the field.
   - If the action is a movement (U, D, L, R), the program updates the position of the entity using the `func_1` function.
   - After updating the position of the entity, the program checks for any eliminations using the `func_2` function. If a player is at the same position as the Bludger, they are eliminated, and their status is updated.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function updates the position of an entity based on the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). It correctly modifies the coordinates of the entity.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if any players are at the same position as the Bludger and eliminates them if they are. It correctly updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]` and prints the elimination message.

5. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all actions, the program prints the final score of the match.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

- **Movement**: The program correctly updates the positions of entities based on the input actions.
- **Goal Scoring**: The program correctly checks if the Quaffle is at a goal and updates the scores accordingly.
- **Elimination**: The program correctly checks if players are at the same position as the Bludger and eliminates them.
- **Output**: The program prints the correct events (goals and eliminations) and the final score.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified scenarios. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
