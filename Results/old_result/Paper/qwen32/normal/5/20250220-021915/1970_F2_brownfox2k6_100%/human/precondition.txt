N and M are odd integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99. The field is a 2D grid of N lines and M columns where each cell contains either '..' (empty cell), 'R0' to 'R9' or 'B0' to 'B9' (players), 'RG' or 'BG' (goals), '.Q' (Quaffle), or '.B' (Bludger). There is at least one goal for each team, and the total number of players (P) for each team is between 1 and 10. T is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each step is a valid action performed by an entity on the field, which can be a move (U, D, L, R), catching a ball (C), or throwing the Quaffle (T).
