You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
    #State: 'YES' if `b[-2] == 0` and `b[-1] == 0` for the last test case; otherwise, 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it performs a series of operations on the list and prints 'YES' if the last two elements of the modified list are both zero, otherwise it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Loop and Index Handling**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = a - 3` (inclusive), which means it processes indices `0` to `n-3`. However, the operation can only be applied at indices `2` to `n-2` (inclusive). The loop should start from `1` to `a - 2` (inclusive) to correctly apply the operation.

2. **Incorrect Modification of Array Elements**:
   - The code incorrectly modifies the array elements by subtracting `b[i] * 2` from `b[i + 1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i + 2]`. This does not align with the operation described in the problem statement, which subtracts `1` from `b[i - 1]`, `2` from `b[i]`, and `1` from `b[i + 1]`.

3. **Negative Values Check**:
   - The code checks if any element becomes negative during the process, but it does not correctly implement the operation, so this check might not be effective.

4. **Final Check for Zeroes**:
   - The final check for `b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0` is not sufficient to determine if all elements are zero. It should check all elements from `b[0]` to `b[-1]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Try to make all elements zero
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i] >= 2 and a[i - 1] >= 1 and a[i + 1] >= 1:
                x = min(a[i] // 2, a[i - 1], a[i + 1])
                a[i] -= 2 * x
                a[i - 1] -= x
                a[i + 1] -= x
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the operations are applied correctly and checks if all elements can be made zero.
