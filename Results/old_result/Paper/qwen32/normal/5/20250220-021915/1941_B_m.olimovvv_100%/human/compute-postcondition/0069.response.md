The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` effectively sets `b[i]` to 0 because subtracting a value from itself results in 0. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is at least `i + 3`; `b[i]` is 0; `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 4 * b[i]`; `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`**.

In natural language: The value of `b[i]` is now 0. All other conditions and variables remain the same as initially described.
