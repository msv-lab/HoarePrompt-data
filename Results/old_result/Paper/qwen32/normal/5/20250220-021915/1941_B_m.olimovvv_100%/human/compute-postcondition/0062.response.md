The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` reduces the value of `b[i]` by its own value, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. This change will impact the condition `if b[i] is less than 0`, which is now no longer applicable since `b[i]` is 0. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is at least 2; `b[i]` is 0; `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`; `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`.**
