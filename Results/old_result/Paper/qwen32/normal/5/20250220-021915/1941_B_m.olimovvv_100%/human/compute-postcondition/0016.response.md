The code snippet `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` updates the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting the value of `b[i]` from it. The values of `t`, `a`, `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, and `i` remain unchanged unless the condition `b[i] < 0` causes a break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which is not directly affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `a` is an integer greater than 2
- `b[i]` is 0
- `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`
- `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged
- `i` remains unchanged

After executing `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`:
- Since `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged because subtracting 0 from any number does not change its value.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged.**
