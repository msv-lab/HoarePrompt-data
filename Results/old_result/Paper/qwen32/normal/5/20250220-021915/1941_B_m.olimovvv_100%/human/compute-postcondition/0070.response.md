The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a - 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `a` is at least `i + 3`
- `b[i]` is 0
- `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 4 * b[i]`
- `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`
- `i` is `i + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must be at least `i + 3` after the increment.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `a` must be at least `i + 3`

State: **`a` is at least `i + 3`; `i` is `i + 1`**
