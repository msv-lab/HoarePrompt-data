The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then maps each string to an integer, creating a list `b` of integers. This operation changes the value of `b` but does not affect the other variables `a` or the precondition related to the values of `b[-2]` and `b[-1]`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input; If `b[-2] == 0` and `b[-1] == 0`, then 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'. The input value for the number of iterations must be incremented by 1.**
