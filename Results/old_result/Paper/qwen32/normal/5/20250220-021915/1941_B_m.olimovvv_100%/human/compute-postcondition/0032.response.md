The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement we are directly inside, but it will not change the values of the variables `a` and `b`. The value of `a` remains at least 3, and `b` is still a list of integers with the current value of `b[i]` being less than 0. The loop or if statement is exited, but no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, the current value of `b[i]` is less than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
