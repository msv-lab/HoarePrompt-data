The code snippet `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the list `b` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 1]`. The variable `a` remains unchanged. The condition regarding the break out of the loop or if statement (if `b[i]` is less than 0) does not affect this specific line of code, so we will only focus on the changes to `b`.

Since `b` is a list of integers and `b[i]` is an element of this list, we can say that `b[i + 1]` will be updated to its current value minus twice the value of `b[i]`.

Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i + 1]` has been updated to `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`.**
