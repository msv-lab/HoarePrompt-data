Output State: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`, `inpstr` must have at least 1 character, `i` is 0, and the last character of `inpstr` (i.e., `inpstr[-i - 1]`) is 'B'. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
