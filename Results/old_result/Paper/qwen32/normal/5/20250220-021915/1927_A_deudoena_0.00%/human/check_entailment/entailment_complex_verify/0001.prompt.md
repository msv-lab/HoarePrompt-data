You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the first 'B' from the end of `inpstr` if a 'B' is found, otherwise `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: len(inpstr) + 1 if no 'B' is found in inpstr, otherwise the number of characters between the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end, inclusive (where ind1 is the index of the first 'B' from the start and ind2 is the index of the first 'B' from the end)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string `inpstr` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'. It calculates and prints the number of characters between the first 'B' from the start and the first 'B' from the end of the string, inclusive. If no 'B' is found (which is not possible as per the problem statement), it would print `len(inpstr) + 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all `n` cells to become white. Given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters, we need to identify the minimum segment that, when painted white, results in the entire string being 'W'.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Identifying the index of the first 'B' from the left (`ind1`).
2. Identifying the index of the first 'B' from the right (`ind2`).
3. Calculating the length of the segment from `ind1` to `ind2` as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` and printing it.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ind2`:** The program calculates `ind2` as the distance from the end of the string to the first 'B' from the right. However, it does not correctly convert this distance to the index of the 'B' from the start of the string. This results in an incorrect calculation of the segment length.
2. **Incorrect Segment Length Calculation:** The segment length should be calculated as `ind2 - ind1 + 1` if `ind1` and `ind2` are the indices of the first and last 'B' in the string, respectively. The current calculation does not correctly account for the segment length.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Identify the index of the first 'B' from the left (`ind1`).
2. Identify the index of the last 'B' from the left (`ind2`).
3. Calculate the segment length as `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.

### Correct Program Example:
Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        ind1 = s.find('B')
        ind2 = s.rfind('B')
        print(ind2 - ind1 + 1)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Therefore, it is incorrect.
