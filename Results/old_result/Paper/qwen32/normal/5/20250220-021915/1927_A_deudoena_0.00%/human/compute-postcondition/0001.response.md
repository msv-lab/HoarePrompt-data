The code snippet provided initializes the variable `ind1` to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `inpstr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' in the string; `inpstr` is the input string; `ind1` is 0.**
