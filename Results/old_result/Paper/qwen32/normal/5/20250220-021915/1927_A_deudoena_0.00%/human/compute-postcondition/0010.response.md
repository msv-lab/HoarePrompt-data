Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the character at the new index `i` in `inpstr`, `ind1` is equal to the incremented value of `i`.**

In simple terms, `ind1` now holds the value of `i` after `i` has been incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain as described in the initial state, with `j` being the character at the new index `i` in `inpstr`.
