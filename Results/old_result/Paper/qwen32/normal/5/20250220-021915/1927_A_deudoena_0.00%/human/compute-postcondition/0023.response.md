The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `inpstr`. If `i` is less than the length of `inpstr`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`, `inpstr` must have at least 1 character, `i` is 1**
