The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `inpstr`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than the length of `inpstr`.

State: **`ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 1 if the last character before the `i`-th character from the end of `inpstr` is 'B', otherwise `ind2` remains 0, `outind` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `s` is the original string, `t` is the length of `inpstr`, `inpstr` must have at least 1 character, `i` is 2**
