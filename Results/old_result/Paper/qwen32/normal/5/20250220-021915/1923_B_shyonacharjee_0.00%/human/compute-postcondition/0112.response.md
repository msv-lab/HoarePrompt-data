Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer, `k` is the last input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the last input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the last input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all processed monsters for the last test case, `success` is True if all monsters were processed without exceeding available time for the last test case, otherwise False.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `t` is 0 because the loop has executed for all `t` test cases.
- `n` and `k` are the values from the last test case.
- `healths` and `positions` are the lists of integers from the last test case.
- `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions from the last test case.
- `total_bullets_used` is the cumulative sum of the healths of all processed monsters in the last test case.
- `success` indicates whether all monsters were processed without exceeding the available time for the last test case (`True` if successful, `False` otherwise).
