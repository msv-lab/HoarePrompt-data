Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `i` is 0, `position` is the first position from the `monsters` list, `health` is the first health value from the `monsters` list, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `abs(position)`, `bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is set to False and the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described.**
