Output State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent unique character, in reverse order of their sorted appearance; `s` is an empty string.**

In natural language: The `char_map` dictionary remains unchanged, still mapping each unique character in the sorted set of `b` to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing in reverse order of their sorted appearance. The variable `s` is now an empty string.
