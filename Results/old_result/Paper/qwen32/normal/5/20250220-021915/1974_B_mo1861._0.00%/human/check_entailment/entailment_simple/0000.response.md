Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to decode a string `b` that has been encoded according to the rules described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and whether it correctly implements the decoding process:

1. **Sorting and Mapping Characters:**
   - The program first creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order.
   - It then maps each character in this sorted set to its symmetric character from the end of the alphabetically ordered set. This is done by creating a dictionary `char_map` where each character `c` in the sorted set is mapped to the character at the mirrored position in the set.
   - For example, if the sorted set of characters is `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`, then `char_map` will map `'a'` to `'d'`, `'b'` to `'c'`, `'c'` to `'b'`, and `'d'` to `'a'`.

2. **Decoding the String:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `s` and iterates over each character `c` in the encoded string `b`.
   - For each character `c`, it appends the corresponding mapped character from `char_map` to `s`.
   - This effectively reverses the encoding process, restoring the original string `s`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the code:

- The line `char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` is incorrect. This line attempts to map each character to a character starting from 'a', which is not what is required. Instead, it should map each character to its symmetric counterpart from the sorted set of unique characters in `b`.

The correct way to construct `char_map` would be:

```python
unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
```

This line correctly maps each character in the sorted set to its symmetric counterpart.

Given this issue, the program as written does not correctly decode the string `b`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
