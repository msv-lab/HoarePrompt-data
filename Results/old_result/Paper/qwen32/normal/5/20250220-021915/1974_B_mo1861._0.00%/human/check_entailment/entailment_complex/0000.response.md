### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to decode a string `b` that was encoded using a specific algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and whether it correctly implements the required decoding process:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`.
   - **Step 1:** It creates a set of unique characters from `b` and sorts them alphabetically. This sorted set is stored in `r` (although `r` is not explicitly defined in the code, it is the sorted set of unique characters).
   - **Step 2:** It constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted set is mapped to its symmetric character in the alphabet. Specifically, the first character in the sorted set is mapped to the last character in the alphabet, the second character to the second last, and so on.
   - **Step 3:** It iterates through each character in the encoded string `b` and uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding decoded character. These characters are concatenated to form the decoded string `s`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded string `s` is returned for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Mapping Construction:** The mapping constructed in `char_map` is incorrect. The mapping should map each character in the sorted set `r` to its symmetric character in `r`, not in the alphabet. For example, if `r` is "cdefors", then 'c' should be mapped to 's', 'd' to 'r', and so on.
- **Symmetric Mapping:** The current code incorrectly maps characters to 'a', 'b', 'c', ..., which is not the intended symmetric mapping within the set `r`.

### Correct Mapping Construction:

To fix the program, the `char_map` should map each character in the sorted set `r` to its symmetric character in `r`. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {}
    n = len(unique_chars)
    for (i, c) in enumerate(unique_chars):
        char_map[c] = unique_chars[n - i - 1]
        
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    return s
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the improper construction of the `char_map`. The mapping should be within the set of unique characters `r`, not in the entire alphabet.

**Correctness:** **False**
