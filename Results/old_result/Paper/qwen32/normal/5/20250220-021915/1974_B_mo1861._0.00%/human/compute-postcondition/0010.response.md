The only variable in the loop head is `c`, which iterates over the elements in `b`. Therefore, the state of `b` is the only thing we can adjust to ensure the loop executes.

To make sure the loop executes, `b` must contain at least one element. The state of `char_map` and `s` do not affect whether the loop will execute, but they are part of the given state and should be included in the final state description.

**State:** `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'a' and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent unique character, in reverse order of their sorted appearance; `s` is an empty string; `b` must be a non-empty string.
