The code updates the value of `char_map[c]` by recalculating it using the new formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so the new value of `char_map[c]` will be `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2))`.

Since `char_map[c]` was initially set to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2))`, the value of `char_map[c]` remains unchanged after the execution of the code snippet.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one character, `i` is 1, `c` is the second character in the sorted unique characters of `b`, `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry where `char_map[c]` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2))`**.
