The provided code snippet initializes an empty dictionary `char_map`. This dictionary is not used in the snippet itself and does not affect the initial state of `b` or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the `char_map` dictionary.

Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the function is called once per test case with the length of `b` being `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5). There are `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) such test cases, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the decoded string `s`. `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**
