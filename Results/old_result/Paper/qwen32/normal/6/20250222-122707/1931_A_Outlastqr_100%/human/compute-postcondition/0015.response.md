Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 52, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `n` is greater than 27, `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. Otherwise, `word` is the string 'aa' + the character at index `n - 3` in `alphabet`.**
