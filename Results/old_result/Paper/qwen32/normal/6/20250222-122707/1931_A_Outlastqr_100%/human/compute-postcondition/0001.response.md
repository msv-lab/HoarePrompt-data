The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is determined by the `range(int(input()))` expression. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be a positive integer indicating the number of iterations. 

Given the problem statement, `t` is the number of test cases and it is already provided as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. Therefore, we should ensure that `int(input())` returns `t` for the loop to execute correctly for all test cases.

Since `t` is already defined and is in the correct range, we do not need to adjust `t` itself, but we do need to ensure that the input function returns `t` when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78 for each of the t test cases, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `int(input())` returns `t`**
