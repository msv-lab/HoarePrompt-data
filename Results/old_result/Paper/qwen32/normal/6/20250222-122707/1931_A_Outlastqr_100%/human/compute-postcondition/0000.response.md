The code snippet provided imports the lowercase English alphabet into a variable named `alphabet`. This operation does not affect the variables `t` or `n`, which are part of the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
