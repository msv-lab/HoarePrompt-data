Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n` within the given range (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The logic in the program is flawed, especially for cases where `n` is less than 52 and not equal to 27. The program does not handle all possible combinations of three letters that could sum up to `n`.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Small `n` Values:**
   - For `n` values between 3 and 27, the program simply constructs a word with 'aa' followed by the letter corresponding to `n-3`. This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible combinations that could result in the same sum. For example, for `n=5`, the correct answer should be 'aaa', not 'aa' followed by any other letter.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `n` Values Greater Than 27:**
   - For `n` values between 28 and 52, the program constructs a word with 'a' followed by the letter corresponding to `n-28` and 'z'. This is also incorrect because it doesn't consider all possible combinations. For example, for `n=28`, the correct answer should be 'aab', not 'a' followed by any other letter and 'z'.

3. **Incorrect Handling of `n` Values Greater Than 52:**
   - For `n` values between 53 and 78, the program constructs a word with the letter corresponding to `n-53` followed by 'zz'. This is incorrect for the same reason as above. For example, for `n=53`, the correct answer should be 'abc', not any letter followed by 'zz'.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible combinations of three letters and selecting the one that is lexicographically smallest and sums up to `n`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        for a in range(26):
            for b in range(26):
                for c in range(26):
                    if a + b + c + 3 == n:
                        candidate = alphabet[a] + alphabet[b] + alphabet[c]
                        if word == '' or candidate < word:
                            word = candidate
        print(word)

func()
```

This program correctly finds the lexicographically smallest word for each `n` by checking all possible combinations of three letters.
