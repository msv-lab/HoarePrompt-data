Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an input integer, `alphabet` is a string containing the lowercase English letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`. If `n` equals 27, `word` is `'aay'`. Otherwise, `word` is `'aa'` concatenated with the character at index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.**
