### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic and conditions provided in the program in comparison to the problem description.

The task is to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that corresponds to a given encoded value `n`. The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.

Here are the conditions and the corresponding logic in the program:

1. **If `n` > 52:**
   - The program constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - Since `n` > 52, the first letter is at least 'b' (because 'b' is the 2nd letter and 2 + 26 + 26 = 54, the smallest possible value for `n` that satisfies this condition).
   - The remaining letters are 'zz', which is the lexicographically largest combination of two letters.
   - This ensures that the word is the smallest possible starting with a letter after 'a' and ending with 'zz'.

2. **If `n` is 27:**
   - The program directly outputs 'aay'.
   - This is because 'aay' corresponds to the sum 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, which is the smallest word that sums to 27.

3. **If 28 <= `n` <= 52:**
   - The program constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - The first letter is 'a', the second letter is determined by `n - 28`, and the third letter is 'z'.
   - This ensures that the word starts with 'a', followed by the smallest possible letter that makes the sum `n`, and ends with 'z', which is the largest possible letter.

4. **If `n` <= 26:**
   - The program constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - This is because the word starts with 'aa' (the smallest possible prefix), and the third letter is determined by `n - 3`.
   - This ensures that the word is the smallest possible starting with 'aa' and ending with the smallest letter that makes the sum `n`.

Let's verify if these conditions cover all possible cases and produce the correct lexicographically smallest word for each `n`.

- For `n = 3`, the output is `'aa' + alphabet[3 - 3]` which is `'aaa'`, correct.
- For `n = 27`, the output is `'aay'`, correct.
- For `n = 28`, the output is `'a' + alphabet[28 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'az'`, but since it's a three-letter word, it should be `'aab'` (1 + 1 + 2 = 4, but we need to reach 28, so it's `'aab'` which is 1 + 1 + 26 = 28), the program seems to have an issue here.
- For `n = 52`, the output is `'a' + alphabet[52 - 28] + 'z'` which is `'ayz'`, correct.
- For `n = 53`, the output is `alphabet[53 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `'azz'`, correct.
- For `n = 78`, the output is `alphabet[78 - 53] + 'zz'` which is `'czz'`, correct.

Upon closer inspection, the program seems to be incorrect for `n = 28` because it outputs `'az'` instead of `'aab'`. The logic for `28 <= n <= 52` should be adjusted to ensure the correct smallest word is generated.

### Correctness: **False**
