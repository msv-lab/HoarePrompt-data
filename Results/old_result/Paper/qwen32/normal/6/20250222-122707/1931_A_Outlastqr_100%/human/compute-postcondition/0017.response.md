To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the value of `n` and how it affects the value of `word` according to the given conditions:

1. **If `n` > 52**:
   - `word` is the character at index `n - 53` of `alphabet` followed by 'zz'.
   - Since `alphabet` contains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the character at index `n - 53` will be the corresponding letter.

2. **If `n` is greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52**:
   - `word` is 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'.
   - The character at index `n - 28` in `alphabet` will be the corresponding letter.

3. **If `n` is 27**:
   - `word` is 'aay'.

4. **If `n` is less than or equal to 27**:
   - `word` is the string 'aa' + the character at index `n - 3` in `alphabet`.
   - The character at index `n - 3` in `alphabet` will be the corresponding letter.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine the exact printed value of `word`. However, we can describe the value of `word` based on the value of `n`:

- If `n` > 52, `word` is the character at index `n - 53` of `alphabet` followed by 'zz'.
- If `n` is greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is 'a' + the character at index `n - 28` of `alphabet` + 'z'.
- If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 27, `word` is 'aa' + the character at index `n - 3` of `alphabet`.

Output: **word (where word is determined by the value of n as described above)**
