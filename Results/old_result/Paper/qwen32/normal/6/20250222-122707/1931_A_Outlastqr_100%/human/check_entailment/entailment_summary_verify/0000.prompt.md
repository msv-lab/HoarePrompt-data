You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 78 and prints a specific string based on the value of `n`. The printed string is determined by specific rules: if `n` > 52, the string is `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`; if `n` is 27, the string is `'aay'`; if 28 <= `n` <= 52, the string is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`; if `n` is less than or equal to 26, the string is `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikita encodes a 3-letter word as the sum of the positions of its characters in the alphabet. The task is to determine the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded to a given sum.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded sum.
3. It constructs the word based on the following conditions:
   - If `n > 52`, it sets the first letter to `alphabet[n - 53]` and the remaining two letters to 'zz'.
   - If `n > 27`, it sets the first letter to 'a', the second letter to `alphabet[n - 28]`, and the third letter to 'z'.
   - If `n == 27`, it sets the word to 'aay'.
   - Otherwise, it sets the first two letters to 'aa' and the third letter to `alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Checking Correctness:
Let's consider the edge cases and some examples to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Example Walkthrough:
1. **Input: 24**
   - The program sets the word to 'aav' because 24 - 3 (for 'aa') = 21, and 'v' is the 22nd letter, so it should be 'u'. However, the program incorrectly sets it to 'v'.
   - Correct output should be 'aav' but the program outputs 'aav' which is correct in this specific case. However, let's check other cases.

2. **Input: 70**
   - The program sets the word to 'rzz' because 70 - 53 = 17, and 'r' is the 18th letter. This is correct.

3. **Input: 3**
   - The program sets the word to 'aaa' because 3 - 3 = 0, and 'a' is the 1st letter. This is correct.

4. **Input: 55**
   - The program sets the word to 'czz' because 55 - 53 = 2, and 'c' is the 3rd letter. This is correct.

5. **Input: 48**
   - The program sets the word to 'auz' because 48 - 28 = 20, and 'u' is the 21st letter. This is correct.

However, let's consider an edge case:
- **Input: 52**
  - The program does not handle this case correctly. According to the conditions:
    - `n > 52` does not apply.
    - `n > 27` applies, so it sets the word to 'a' + alphabet[52 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + 'y' + 'z' = 'ayz'.
    - But the lexicographically smallest word for 52 should be 'azz' because 'a' + 'z' + 'z' = 1 + 26 + 26 = 53 - 1 = 52.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly handle the case where the encoded sum is 52. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program fails to produce the correct lexicographically smallest word for the encoded sum of 52.
