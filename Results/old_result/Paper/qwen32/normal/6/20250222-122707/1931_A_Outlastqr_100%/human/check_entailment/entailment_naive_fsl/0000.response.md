Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikita encodes a 3-letter word as the sum of the positions of its characters in the alphabet. The task is to determine the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded to a given sum.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the encoded sum.
3. It constructs the word based on the following conditions:
   - If `n > 52`, it sets the first letter to `alphabet[n - 53]` and the remaining two letters to 'zz'.
   - If `n > 27`, it sets the first letter to 'a', the second letter to `alphabet[n - 28]`, and the third letter to 'z'.
   - If `n == 27`, it sets the word to 'aay'.
   - Otherwise, it sets the first two letters to 'aa' and the third letter to `alphabet[n - 3]`.

### Checking Correctness:
Let's consider the edge cases and some examples to verify the correctness of the program.

#### Example Walkthrough:
1. **Input: 24**
   - The program sets the word to 'aav' because 24 - 3 (for 'aa') = 21, and 'v' is the 22nd letter, so it should be 'u'. However, the program incorrectly sets it to 'v'.
   - Correct output should be 'aav' but the program outputs 'aav' which is correct in this specific case. However, let's check other cases.

2. **Input: 70**
   - The program sets the word to 'rzz' because 70 - 53 = 17, and 'r' is the 18th letter. This is correct.

3. **Input: 3**
   - The program sets the word to 'aaa' because 3 - 3 = 0, and 'a' is the 1st letter. This is correct.

4. **Input: 55**
   - The program sets the word to 'czz' because 55 - 53 = 2, and 'c' is the 3rd letter. This is correct.

5. **Input: 48**
   - The program sets the word to 'auz' because 48 - 28 = 20, and 'u' is the 21st letter. This is correct.

However, let's consider an edge case:
- **Input: 52**
  - The program does not handle this case correctly. According to the conditions:
    - `n > 52` does not apply.
    - `n > 27` applies, so it sets the word to 'a' + alphabet[52 - 28] + 'z' = 'a' + 'y' + 'z' = 'ayz'.
    - But the lexicographically smallest word for 52 should be 'azz' because 'a' + 'z' + 'z' = 1 + 26 + 26 = 53 - 1 = 52.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly handle the case where the encoded sum is 52. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program fails to produce the correct lexicographically smallest word for the encoded sum of 52.
