To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the code systematically.

### Problem Understanding

The goal is to distribute the bets (`x_i`) such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Mathematically, for each outcome `i`, the following condition must hold:

\[ \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i \]

### Code Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve this problem by:

1. Calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers (`k_i`).
2. Dividing the LCM by each multiplier to get a list `vprod`.
3. Checking if the sum of `vprod` is less than the LCM. If not, it outputs `-1`.
4. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

### Function Summaries

- `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
- `func_2()`: Reads input, computes the LCM of the multipliers, computes `vprod`, checks the condition, and prints the result.

### Evaluation

Let's revisit the original assessment and challenge it with the provided code and function summaries.

#### Test Case Analysis

**Test Case 1:**
```
1
3
2 2 2
```
- LCM of `[2, 2, 2]` is `2`.
- `vprod` would be `[1, 1, 1]`.
- Sum of `vprod` is `3`, which is not less than `2`.
- The code correctly outputs `-1`.

**Test Case 2:**
```
1
2
2 3
```
- LCM of `[2, 3]` is `6`.
- `vprod` would be `[3, 2]`.
- Sum of `vprod` is `5`, which is less than `6`.
- The code correctly outputs `3 2`.

**Test Case 3:**
```
1
3
2 3 5
```
- LCM of `[2, 3, 5]` is `30`.
- `vprod` would be `[15, 10, 6]`.
- Sum of `vprod` is `31`, which is not less than `30`.
- The code correctly outputs `-1`.

However, the original assessment mentions that the output `30 20 12` is incorrect because the total bet `62` is not less than the amount received back for any of the outcomes (4, 6, and 10). This is a valid point.

### Correctness of the Code

The code's logic is flawed because it does not guarantee that the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The approach of using the LCM and dividing it by each multiplier does not ensure the required condition.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

**Final: False**
