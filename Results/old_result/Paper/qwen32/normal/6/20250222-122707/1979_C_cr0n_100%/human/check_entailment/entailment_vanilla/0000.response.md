Let's analyze the given program with respect to the problem description.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to distribute bets on `n` outcomes such that the total bet amount is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- Each outcome has a multiplier `k_i`.
- If the `i-th` outcome wins, you receive `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the bet on that outcome.
- The total bet `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n` must be strictly less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

### Program Analysis:
The program uses the following steps:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers stored in `den`.
   - It then computes `vprod` as a list where each element is `den // r` for each multiplier `r` in `vals`.
   - It calculates `den` as `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den <= 0`, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod` as the bets.

### Verification:
Let's verify if the program is correct by checking if the conditions are met.

- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that `den` is a common multiple of all `k_i`.
- **Bets Calculation**: The values in `vprod` are calculated as `den // k_i`. This ensures that `k_i * vprod[i] = den` for each `i`.
- **Total Bet Calculation**: The total bet is `sum(vprod)`, which is equal to `den - den = 0` initially, but since `den` is the LCM, `sum(vprod)` is less than `den` because `den` is subtracted by `sum(vprod)`.
- **Condition Check**: The condition `den <= 0` checks if the total bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome. If `den` is positive, it means the total bet is less than `den`, and `den` is equal to `k_i * vprod[i]` for each `i`.

However, there is a flaw in the program. The program calculates `den` as `den - sum(vprod)`, which should be a positive value for the solution to be valid. If `den` becomes non-positive, it incorrectly concludes that no valid distribution is possible. But the correct condition should ensure that `sum(vprod) < den / k_i` for each `i`.

### Correctness:
The program does not correctly handle the condition that the total bet should be strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The program incorrectly calculates the total bet and the condition check is flawed.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
