The code snippet creates a new list `vprod` where each element is the result of `den` integer divided by each corresponding element `r` in the list `vals`. The values of `N`, `vals`, and `den` remain unchanged, but `vprod` is newly created.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers, `den` is the value returned by applying `func_1` cumulatively to all elements in `vals` starting with `den = vals[0]`, and `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.**
