To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the provided information and the loop structure.

### Given:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes.
  - `vals` is a list of integers.
  - `den` is assigned the value of `vals[0]`.

- **Loop Code**:
  ```python
  for x in vals:
      den = func_1(den, x)
  ```

- **Output States After Iterations**:
  - **After 1 iteration**:
    - `den` is the result of `func_1(vals[0], vals[0])`.
    - `vals` must have at least 1 integer.
  - **After 2 iterations**:
    - `den` is the result of `func_1(den, vals[1])`.
    - `vals` must have at least 2 integers.
  - **After 3 iterations**:
    - `den` is the result of `func_1(den, vals[2])`.
    - `vals` must have at least 3 integers.

### Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `vals`. For each iteration, the value of `den` is updated by calling `func_1(den, x)`. The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in the list `vals`.

### Final Output State:
After all iterations, `den` will have been updated through all the elements in `vals`. The final value of `den` will be the result of applying `func_1` cumulatively to all elements in `vals`.

### Conclusion:
The final output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:
- `N` remains the same integer representing the number of outcomes.
- `vals` remains the same list of integers.
- `den` is the result of `func_1` applied cumulatively to all elements in `vals`, starting with `vals[0]`.

Output State: **N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, vals is a list of integers, and den is the value returned by applying func_1 cumulatively to all elements in vals starting with den = vals[0].**
