The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `vals`. If there are more elements in `vals` after the current element `x`, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the current element from `vals`. For the loop to execute one more time, `vals` must have at least one more element after the current `x`. Therefore, `x` should be updated to the next element in `vals`.

State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `den` is the value returned by `func_1(vals[0], vals[0])`, `x` is the next element in `vals` after the first iteration**
