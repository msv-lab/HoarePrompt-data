To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the line `den = func_1(den, x)`. This line updates the value of `den` by passing the current values of `den` and `x` to the function `func_1`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes.
- `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer.
- `den` is assigned the value of `vals[0]`.
- `x` is the first element in `vals` during the first iteration.

Since `den` and `x` are both initially set to `vals[0]`, the function `func_1` is called with `den` and `x` both equal to `vals[0]`.

After the function call, `den` will hold whatever value `func_1` returns.

Since we do not have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact value of `den` after the function call. However, we can express the output state in terms of the function's return value.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `den` is the value returned by `func_1(vals[0], vals[0])`, `x` is the first element in `vals` during the first iteration.**
