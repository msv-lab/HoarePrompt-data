### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if it meets the requirements.

The problem requires us to distribute bets on `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, given multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.

#### Key Steps in the Code:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read first.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals` are read.

2. **Computing Denominator (`den`):**
   - The denominator `den` is initially set to the first multiplier `vals[0]`.
   - `den` is then updated to be the least common multiple (LCM) of `den` and each subsequent multiplier in `vals`. This is done using the `func_1` function, which computes the LCM of two numbers.

3. **Computing `vprod`:**
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`. This effectively divides `den` by each multiplier, resulting in a list of integers.

4. **Adjusting `den`:**
   - `den` is then adjusted by subtracting the sum of `vprod` from it.
   - If the adjusted `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1`, indicating it's impossible to distribute the bets as required.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - If `den` is greater than 0, the function prints the elements of `vprod` as the bets for each outcome.

#### Analysis:
- The key idea here is to use the LCM of the multipliers to ensure that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.
- By dividing the LCM by each multiplier, we get a distribution of bets that ensures the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.
- The check `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total bet is indeed less than the return for any winning outcome.

#### Verification with Examples:
- For the first test case:
  - Input: `3 3 2 7`
  - LCM of `3, 2, 7` is `42`.
  - `vprod` is `[14, 21, 6]`.
  - `den - sum(vprod)` is `42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 1`.
  - The output is `14 21 6`, which sums to `39`, and `39 < 42`, `39 < 42`, and `39 < 42` when multiplied by `3, 2, 7` respectively.
  
- For the second test case:
  - Input: `2 3 3`
  - LCM of `3, 3` is `3`.
  - `vprod` is `[1, 1]`.
  - `den - sum(vprod)` is `3 - (1 + 1) = 1`.
  - The output is `1 1`, which sums to `2`, and `2 < 3` and `2 < 3` when multiplied by `3, 3` respectively.
  
- For the third test case:
  - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
  - LCM of `5, 5, 5, 5, 5` is `5`.
  - `vprod` is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - `den - sum(vprod)` is `5 - (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 0`.
  - The output is `-1` because `den` is not greater than `0`.

Based on the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome, ensuring the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
