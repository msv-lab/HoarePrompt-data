The code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Given the initial state, `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`, plus the element `(q + r) % n`. Adding `(q - r) % n` again will not change `temp` if it already contains this value, as sets do not allow duplicate values.

Thus, the only change is the addition of `(q - r) % n` to `temp`, but since it might already be in `temp`, the set `temp` remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and is greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and contains at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `temp` remains an empty set. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`, plus the element `(q + r) % n`. `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x`, and `q` is the next element in the set `ans` that has not been processed yet.**
