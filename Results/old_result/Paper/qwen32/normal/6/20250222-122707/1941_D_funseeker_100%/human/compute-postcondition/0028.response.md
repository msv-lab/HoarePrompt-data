The provided Python code snippet initializes an empty set named `temp`. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`, or `ans`). The state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x` if `c` is '1' or '?'. If `c` is '0', `ans` is an empty set, `temp` is an empty set.**
