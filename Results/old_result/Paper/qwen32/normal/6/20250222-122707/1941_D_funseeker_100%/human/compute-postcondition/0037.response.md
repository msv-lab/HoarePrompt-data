The code snippet provided adds a new element to the `temp` set. Specifically, it adds the value `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly impacted by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first return value of `func_3()`
- `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and is greater than 1
- `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and contains at least one element
- `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`
- `c` is '1' or '?'
- `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`
- `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x`
- `q` is the next element in the set `ans` that has not been processed yet

The code modifies `temp` by adding `(q + r) % n` to it.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and is greater than 1, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and contains at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for some `q` in `x`, plus the element `(q + r) % n`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `x`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans` that has not been processed yet.**
