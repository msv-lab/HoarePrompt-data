### Reasoning:

The program is designed to determine the possible positions of the ball after a series of throws where the direction of some throws is unknown. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `x`, where `n` is the number of players, `m` is the number of throws, and `x` is the starting player.

2. **Processing Throws**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' (clockwise), it calculates the new position as `(q + r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` and adds it to a temporary set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' (counterclockwise), it calculates the new position as `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` and adds it to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '?', it calculates both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` and adds them to `temp`.
   - After processing each throw, `ans` is updated to `temp`.

3. **Handling Modulo Operation**:
   - The program ensures that the modulo operation does not result in `0`. If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added instead.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of unique possible positions of the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these positions.

### Verification Against Provided Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `6 3 2`, then `2 ?`, `2 ?`, `2 ?`
  - The ball can be at positions `2`, `4`, or `6` after three throws with unknown directions.
  - Output: `3`, `2 4 6`
  
- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: `12 1 2`, then `3 1`
  - The ball is thrown counterclockwise by `3`, so it ends up at position `11`.
  - Output: `1`, `11`
  
- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: `10 7 4`, then `2 ?`, `9 1`, `4 ?`, `7 0`, `2 0`, `8 1`, `5 ?`
  - The possible positions after all throws are `3`, `5`, `7`, and `9`.
  - Output: `4`, `3 5 7 9`
  
- **Test Case 4**: 
  - Input: `5 3 1`, then `4 0`, `4 ?`, `1 ?`
  - The possible positions after all throws are `2`, `3`, and `5`.
  - Output: `3`, `2 3 5`
  
- **Test Case 5**: 
  - Input: `4 1 1`, then `2 ?`
  - The ball can be at positions `3` after one throw with an unknown direction.
  - Output: `1`, `3`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly processes each test case as described in the problem statement and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
