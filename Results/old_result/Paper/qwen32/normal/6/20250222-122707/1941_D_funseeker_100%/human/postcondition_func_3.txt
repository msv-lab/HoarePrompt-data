The function `func_4` computes a set of unique values based on a series of operations involving addition and subtraction modulo `n`. It starts with an initial value `x` and iteratively updates this set `m` times by adding or subtracting `r` modulo `n`, depending on the character `c` which can be '0', '1', or '?'. If the result of these operations includes `0`, it is replaced with `n`. The function then prints the number of elements in the final set and the sorted elements themselves.
