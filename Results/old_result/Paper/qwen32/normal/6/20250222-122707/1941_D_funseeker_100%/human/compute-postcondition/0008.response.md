The code snippet adds a tuple to the `temp` set. The tuple consists of the result of `(q + r) % n`. Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `r`, and `q` are used to compute this value. The values of `m`, `x`, and `c` remain unchanged. The `temp` set, initially empty, now contains one element, which is the computed tuple.

Output State: **`n` is the first return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the second return value of `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the third return value of `func_3()` and must be an iterable with at least one element, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '0' or '?', `ans` is `x`, `temp` is a set containing the element `(q + r) % n`**.
