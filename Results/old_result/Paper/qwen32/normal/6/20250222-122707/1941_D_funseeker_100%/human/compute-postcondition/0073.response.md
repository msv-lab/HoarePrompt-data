The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the value `0` from the set `ans` if it is present. Given that the initial state specifies that `ans` includes `0`, executing this line will remove `0` from the set. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is a set of all unique values computed from `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the previous `ans` set, based on the `c` values from each iteration, excluding `0`; `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` remain unchanged; `c` is the value from the last iteration of `func_1().split()`.**
