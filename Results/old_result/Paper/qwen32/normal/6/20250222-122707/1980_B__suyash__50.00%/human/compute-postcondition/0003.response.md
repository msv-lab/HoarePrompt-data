The code snippet takes the input string `a`, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring into an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a` is an input string; `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the whitespace-separated values in `a` to integers.**
