The code snippet takes the input string `a`, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list `b`. The variables `i` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is the value of `input()`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in `a` to integers.**
