Postcondition: **`i` is `len(l) - 1`, `t` is greater than `len(l)`, `a` is the value of the new `input()`, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the space-separated values in the previous `a` to integers, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 substring, `n` is the first element of `b`, `f` is the second element of `b`, `dic` is a dictionary with keys as elements from `o` and values as their respective counts in `o`, `l` is a list of unique elements from `o` sorted in descending order, `fav` is `o[f - 1]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `k` is less than or equal to 0. If `fav` is equal to `l[i]`, `k` is `b[2] - 2 * dic[l[len(l)]] - dic[l[i]]`. If `fav` is not equal to `l[i]`, `k` is `b[2] - 2 * dic[l[len(l)]]`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of regardless of whether `k` is less than 0 or not if `fav` is equal to `l[i]`.**
