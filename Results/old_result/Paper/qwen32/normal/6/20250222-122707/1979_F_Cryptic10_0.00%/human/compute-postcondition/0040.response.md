Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. `path` is a list containing one or two elements, the original vertex, and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in the set. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current value of `v` remains 0. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
