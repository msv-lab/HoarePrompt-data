Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is decreased by 1 from its current value; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; If `v` was initially 0, `d` is set to `n - 2`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` as its last element, and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**
