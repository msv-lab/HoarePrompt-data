### Reasoning:
Let's break down the given program and check if it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - This function takes a single integer `d` as input, which represents the minimum degree a vertex must have for the query.
   - It sends a query to the interactor in the format `? d` and reads the response, which contains two integers `v` and `u`.
   - The function returns the tuple `(v, u)`.
   - The function is correctly implemented as per the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function takes the number of vertices `n` in the graph.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the order they are added to the path.
   - It initializes a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - The function enters a loop that continues until all vertices are included in the path.
   - Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees `d` from `n-1` down to 0.
   - For each degree `d`, it calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` and the non-connected vertex `u`.
   - If `v` is 0, it means no vertex with degree at least `d` was found, and the loop continues with the next degree.
   - If `v` is a valid vertex and is still in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the `path`, removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`, and breaks out of the degree iteration loop to start the next query.
   - After all vertices are added to the path, it prints the path in the required format `! [vertices in path separated by spaces]`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path by iteratively querying the interactor for vertices with decreasing degrees until all vertices are included in the path.
- The program ensures that it does not exceed `n` queries for each test case.
- The program handles the case where no vertex with the required degree is found by continuing to the next degree.
- The program correctly flushes the output after each query and after printing the final path.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly meets the problem description and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Correctness: **True**
