Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, and now includes `v` (which is 0); `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex but does not include `v` (which is 0); `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The current value of `v` is 0 and `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
