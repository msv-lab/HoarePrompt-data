Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop. If `v` (which is 0) is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` includes `v` and `remaining_vertices` does not include `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
