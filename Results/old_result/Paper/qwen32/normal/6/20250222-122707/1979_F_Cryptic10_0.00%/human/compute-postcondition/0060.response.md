The code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` assigns the values returned by the function `func_1` with the argument `d` to the variables `v` and `u`. Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only assume that `v` and `u` will be assigned whatever values `func_1(d)` returns. The values of `n`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` are not affected by this line of code, and `remaining_vertices` still contains at least one vertex.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
