Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing two elements, the original vertex and `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current value of `v` remains 0; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
