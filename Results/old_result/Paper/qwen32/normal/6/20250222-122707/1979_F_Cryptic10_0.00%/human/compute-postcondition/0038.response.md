The code snippet `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the element `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Given that `v` is a specific value that is currently in `remaining_vertices`, after this operation, `v` will no longer be part of the set.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing two elements, the original vertex and `v`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex, and `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current value of `v` remains 0.**
