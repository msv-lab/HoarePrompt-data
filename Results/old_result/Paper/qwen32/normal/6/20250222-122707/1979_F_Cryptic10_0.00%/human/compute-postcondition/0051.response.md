The code snippet provided is a `continue` statement, which means the current iteration of the loop will be skipped, and the loop will proceed to the next iteration. None of the variables (`n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `d`, `v`, `u`) are modified by this statement. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex, and optionally `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex; `d` is now `d - 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
