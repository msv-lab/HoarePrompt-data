Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The current value of `v` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since the provided code snippet only contains the `continue` statement, no changes are made to the initial state of the variables.
