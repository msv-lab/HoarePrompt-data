Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop. If `v` (which is 0) is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` includes `v` and `remaining_vertices` does not include `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing the original vertex and optionally additional vertices that were in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, with `v` appended to it if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`; `d` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is no longer in `remaining_vertices` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `path` remains unchanged and `remaining_vertices` also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `d` is `d + 1`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is appended to `path` and `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` after the operation, and the loop or if statement is broken out of. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, there is no change to `path` or `remaining_vertices`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
