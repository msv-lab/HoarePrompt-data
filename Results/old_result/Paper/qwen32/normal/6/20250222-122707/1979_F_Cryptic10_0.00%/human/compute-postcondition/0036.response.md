Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing one element, which is a vertex from the set of remaining vertices; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing at least one vertex; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current value of `v` remains 0. The current value of `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**
