Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, then the current value of `v` remains 0.**
