Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` as its last element, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains unchanged and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.**
