The only variable in the loop head is `d`. According to the loop statement, `d` starts from `n - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` would have been decremented by 1. So, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to decrease `d` by 1 from its current value.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. 
- If `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`.
- If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` as its last element, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v`.
- If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains unchanged and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.

To proceed to the next iteration, we need to adjust `d`:
- Since `d` is currently the value from the previous iteration, we need to decrease it by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is decreased by 1 from its current value, `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` was initially 0, `d` is `n - 2`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list containing the value of `v` as its last element, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n except `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` remains unchanged and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.**
