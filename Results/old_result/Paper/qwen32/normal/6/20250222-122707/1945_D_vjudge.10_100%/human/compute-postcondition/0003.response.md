The code snippet provided modifies the value of `pergunta` by taking the minimum between its current value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]`. Given that `x` is 0 and `i` is `n - 1`, the expression `x + a[i]` simplifies to `a[n - 1]`. Therefore, `pergunta` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `a[n - 1]`.

Since `a` is a list of integers and `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill, `a[n - 1]` represents the cost for the last person in the queue.

The values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its current value and `a[n - 1]`; `a` and `b` are lists of integers; `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill; `x` is 0; `i` is `n - 1`.**
