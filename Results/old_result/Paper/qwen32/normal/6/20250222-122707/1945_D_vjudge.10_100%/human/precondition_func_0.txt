pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a and b are lists of integers where a_i and b_i represent the costs for each person in the queue (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), n is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
