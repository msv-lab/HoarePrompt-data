You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a and b are lists of integers where a_i and b_i represent the costs for each person in the queue (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), n is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: `pergunta` is the minimum cost of placing Kirill in a position `i < m` with the accumulated minimum costs of all people in the queue up to that point; `x` is the sum of the minimum costs of all people in the queue; `a` and `b` are lists of integers; `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum cost of placing Kirill in a position i < m with the accumulated minimum costs of all people in the queue up to that point)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `pergunta` (the number of test cases), `a` (a list of integers representing the costs for each person in the queue), `b` (a list of integers representing the costs for each person in the queue), `n` (the number of people in the queue besides Kirill), and `m` (the maximum allowable final position of Kirill). For each test case, the function returns the minimum cost required to position Kirill at a position from 0 to m in the queue.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
