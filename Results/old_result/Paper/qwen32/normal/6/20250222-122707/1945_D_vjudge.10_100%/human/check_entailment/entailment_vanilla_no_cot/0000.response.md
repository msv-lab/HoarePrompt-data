Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first `m` people in the queue. However, the logic in the function is flawed and does not consider all necessary conditions to achieve the optimal solution.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The current implementation calculates `x` as the cumulative cost of bribing people, but it adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each person, which is not the correct way to calculate the cost. The cost should consider the specific conditions for bribing a person to a particular position.

2. **Handling of `b_i` Costs**: The current implementation does not correctly account for the `b_i` costs for people who are between the positions being swapped. The problem statement specifies that for each `k` such that `j < k < i`, Kirill will have to pay `b_k` coins to the person at position `k`. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Optimal Path Not Guaranteed**: The current implementation does not guarantee finding the optimal path (minimum cost) for Kirill to reach a position among the first `m` people. It uses a greedy approach that may not yield the minimum cost in all cases.

To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated greedy algorithm that correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement would be necessary. The current implementation needs to be revised to address these issues.
