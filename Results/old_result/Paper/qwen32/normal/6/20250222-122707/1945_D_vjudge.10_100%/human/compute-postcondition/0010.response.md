The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop decrements `i` from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.

So, `i` should be `n - 3` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]` if `i < m`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged; `a` and `b` are lists of integers; `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill; `x` is `2 * min(a[i], b[i])`; `i` is `n - 3`**
