Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` and `b` are lists of integers where `a_i` and `b_i` represent the costs for each person in the queue (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `x` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if i < m:
        pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
    x += min(a[i], b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `pergunta` is the minimum of its current value and `a[n - 1]` if `i < m`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged; `a` and `b` are lists of integers; `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill; `x` is `min(a[i], b[i])`; `i` is `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `pergunta` is the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]` if `i < m`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged; `a` and `b` are lists of integers; `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill; `x` is `2 * min(a[i], b[i])`; `i` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `pergunta` is the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]` if `i < m`. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged; `a` and `b` are lists of integers; `n` is the number of people in the queue besides Kirill; `m` is the maximum allowable final position of Kirill; `x` is `3 * min(a[i], b[i])`; `i` is `n - 3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
