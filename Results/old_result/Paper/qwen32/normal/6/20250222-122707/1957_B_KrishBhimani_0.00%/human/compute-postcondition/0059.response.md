The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `k // 2`, which means `k` has been halved. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than zero.

Since `k` is halved in each iteration, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `k` must have been greater than 1 before the halving operation. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is greater than 1; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is 1; `arr` is `[0]` if `k0` is odd, otherwise `arr` remains `[]`; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`**
