Postcondition: **`arr` must have at least one element. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` has one additional element equal to `k0 - sum(ans)` before the new element was appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` and `c` does not equal `n - 1`.**
