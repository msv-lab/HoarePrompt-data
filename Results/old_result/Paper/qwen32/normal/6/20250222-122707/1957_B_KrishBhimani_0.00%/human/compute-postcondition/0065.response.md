The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `arr` will now include this value.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is greater than 0
- `k0` is the original `k`
- `i` is 2
- `arr` is `[0, 1]` if `k0` is odd, otherwise `arr` is `[1]`
- `c` is `n - 1`
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`

After executing `arr.append(i)`:
- `arr` will be `[0, 1, 2]` if `k0` is odd, otherwise `arr` will be `[1, 2]`

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is greater than 0; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is 2; `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]` if `k0` is odd, otherwise `arr` is `[1, 2]`; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.**
