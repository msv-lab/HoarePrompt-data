To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variables. The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. The loop shifts `k` to the right by one bit (`k = k >> 1`) in each iteration, which is equivalent to integer division by 2. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and if the least significant bit of `k` (i.e., `k & 1 == 1`) is 1, `i` is appended to the list `arr`.

The loop will terminate when `k` becomes 0. This means that the number of iterations is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `k`.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `t`: remains unchanged.
- `l1`: remains unchanged.
- `n`: remains unchanged.
- `k`: becomes 0.
- `k0`: remains unchanged (it's the original value of `k`).
- `i`: equals the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `k`.
- `arr`: contains the indices of the bits that were set (1) in the binary representation of the initial value of `k`.

Given the pattern observed in the first three iterations, the final state of `arr` will be a list of indices of the bits that are set in the binary representation of the initial value of `k`.

For example, if `k` was 13 (binary `1101`), the loop would execute 4 times, and `arr` would be `[0, 2, 3]` because the 0th, 2nd, and 3rd bits are set.

Thus, the output state after all iterations is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original value of `k`; `arr` is a list of indices of the bits that are set in the binary representation of the original value of `k`.**
