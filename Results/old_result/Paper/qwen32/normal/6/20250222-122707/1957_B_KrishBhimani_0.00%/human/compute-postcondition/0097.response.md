The code snippet provided resets the variable `arr` to an empty list. This change does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `arr` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is an empty list; `c` is an integer such that `c` is equal to `n - 1` or `arr` is exhausted; `ans` is a list containing the elements `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` up to the point where `c` reaches `n - 1`, and if `c` reached `n - 1`, `ans` also includes `k0 - sum(ans)` as its last element, extended with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**
