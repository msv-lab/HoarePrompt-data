To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the structure of the `ans` list.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Initial Values:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` and `k0` are initialized to 0.
   - `i` is the last element in `arr`.
   - `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements.
   - `c` is `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is a list of `n` elements where:
     - The first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr`.
     - The last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.

2. **Structure of `ans`:**
   - The first `n-1` elements of `ans` are calculated as \(1 \leftshift i\) for each `i` in `arr`. This means each element is \(2^i\).
   - The last element of `ans` is the negative sum of the first `n-1` elements.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `arr` has the elements `[0, 1, 2]` and `n` is 3 (since `n` is the length of `arr`).

- The first `n-1` elements of `ans`:
  - `1 << 0` = \(2^0\) = 1
  - `1 << 1` = \(2^1\) = 2
  - `1 << 2` = \(2^2\) = 4
- The last element of `ans`:
  - `-sum(ans[:n-1])` = \(-(1 + 2 + 4)\) = -7

Thus, `ans` would be `[1, 2, 4, -7]`.

### General Case:
For a general `arr` with `n` elements, the first `n-1` elements of `ans` are \(2^{arr[0]}, 2^{arr[1]}, \ldots, 2^{arr[n-2]}\). The last element is the negative sum of these values.

### Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Output: **2^arr[0] 2^arr[1] ... 2^arr[n-2] -sum(2^arr[0], 2^arr[1], ..., 2^arr[n-2]) (where `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements and `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`)**

However, to make it more precise and human-readable, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **2^arr[0] 2^arr[1] ... 2^arr[n-2] -sum(2^arr[0], 2^arr[1], ..., 2^arr[n-2]) (where `arr` is the list of integers and `n` is the length of `arr`)**

Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can't give the exact numerical values, but we can describe the structure of the output precisely. 

Output: **2^arr[0] 2^arr[1] ... 2^arr[n-2] -sum(2^arr[0], 2^arr[1], ..., 2^arr[n-2]) (where `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements and `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`)**

Given the structure, we can simplify the output description to:

Output: **2^arr[0] 2^arr[1] ... 2^arr[n-2] -sum(2^arr[0], 2^arr[1], ..., 2^arr[n-2])**
