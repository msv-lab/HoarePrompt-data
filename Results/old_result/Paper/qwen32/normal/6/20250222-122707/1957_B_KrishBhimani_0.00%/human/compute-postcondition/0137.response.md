Output State: **`arr` must have at least two elements; `c` is incremented by 3; `ans` has one additional element equal to `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` includes an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)` before the last element was added, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` has `1 << i` as its last element, and the loop or if statement continues. `i` is `i2`.**

In natural language: The list `ans` now has one more element, which is `1 << i`. All other conditions and variable states remain the same as described in the initial state.
