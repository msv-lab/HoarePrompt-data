To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is truthy. Since `k` is an integer, the loop will execute if `k` is not equal to 0.

Given:
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `k0` is `k`.
- `k` is used in the `while` loop condition.

The only variable in the loop head is `k`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is not equal to 0 for the loop to execute.

The state right before the loop is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `k0` is `k`.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr` is [].
- `c` is `n - 1`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.

Since `k` must be non-zero for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `k` is not 0. Given that `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, we need to adjust `k` to be a non-zero value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of `l1`; `k0` is `k`; `i` is 0; `arr` is []; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`**.
