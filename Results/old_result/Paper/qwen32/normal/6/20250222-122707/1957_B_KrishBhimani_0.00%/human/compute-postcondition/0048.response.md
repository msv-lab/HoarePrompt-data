The code snippet provided is `l1 = input().split()`. This line of code takes an input string from the user, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `l1`. 

Given the initial state, `l1` is already a list of substrings from the input string. After executing this line, `l1` will be overwritten with the new list of substrings from the new input string. However, the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `c`, `ans`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is the last element in `arr`; `arr` is a list with at least `n` elements; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.**
