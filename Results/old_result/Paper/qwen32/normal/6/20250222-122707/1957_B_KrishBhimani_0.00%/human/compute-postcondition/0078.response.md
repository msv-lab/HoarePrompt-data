The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends a value to the list `ans`. The value being appended is `1` left-shifted by `i` bits, which is equivalent to `2^i`.

Given the initial state, the variable `ans` is either a list containing the single element `k0` or it is not yet defined. After the execution of the code snippet, `ans` will definitely contain the additional element `1 << i`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element; `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `c` is increased by 1; `ans` is a list that includes the element `1 << i`.**
