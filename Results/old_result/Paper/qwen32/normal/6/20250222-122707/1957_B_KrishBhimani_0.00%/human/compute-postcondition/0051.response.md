Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `k0` is `k`; `i` is the last element in `arr`; `arr` is []; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.**

In simple terms, the value of `k0` has been updated to be equal to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
