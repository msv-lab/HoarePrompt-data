The code appends `1 << i` to the list `ans`. This means that `ans` now includes an additional element which is `2` raised to the power of `i` (since `1 << i` is equivalent to `2**i` in Python).

Here's the updated state of the variables:
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` remains a new list of substrings from the new input string.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` remains 0.
- `k0` remains the original `k`.
- `i` remains the next element in `arr` after the current one.
- `arr` remains a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element.
- `c` remains an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `ans` now includes an additional element `1 << i`.
- `c` remains `c + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the original `k`, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current one, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element, `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `ans` is a list that includes the element `1 << i` and potentially `k0 - (1 << i)` if `c` was equal to `n - 1` in the previous iteration. If `c` equals `n - 1`, `ans` now includes an additional element `k0 - sum(ans)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to `ans`. `c` is now `c + 1`.**
