The provided Python code snippet appends the value `1 << i` to the list `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, or `arr`. The only variable that changes is `ans`, which now includes an additional element `1 << i`.

Given the initial state, we know `ans` already contains some elements, and `i` is an element from `arr`, which is a list of indices where bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`. The operation `1 << i` shifts the number 1 to the left by `i` positions, effectively creating a binary number with only the `i-th` bit set to 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the original `k`; `i` is the next element in `arr`; `arr` is a list containing the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0` and must contain at least one element; `c` is an integer such that `c < n - 1` or `ans` is a list containing the single element `k0` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `c` is increased by 1; `ans` is a list that includes the element `1 << i`. If `c` equals `n - 1`, the loop or if statement is broken out of and `ans` includes the elements `1 << i` and `k0 - (1 << i)`. `c` is now `c + 1`. `ans` now includes the additional element `1 << i`.**
