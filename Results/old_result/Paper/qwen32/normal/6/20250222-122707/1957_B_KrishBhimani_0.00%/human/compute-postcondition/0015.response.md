The code snippet `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on the variable `k`. This operation effectively divides `k` by 2 and discards the remainder (integer division by 2).

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 2 (integer division) and `k` must be greater than 0.
- `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`.
- `i` is 1.
- If `k0` is odd, then `arr` is [0, 1]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1].

After executing `k = k >> 1`:
- The value of `k` is now `k` divided by 2 (integer division).

The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k0`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings from the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` divided by 4 (integer division) and `k` must be greater than 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k` divided by 2 (integer division); `i` is 1; if `k0` is odd, then `arr` is [0, 1]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1].**
