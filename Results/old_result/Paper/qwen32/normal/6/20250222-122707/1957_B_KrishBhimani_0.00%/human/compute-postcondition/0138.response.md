To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop are completed, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given information and the conditions.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (not directly used in the loop).
- `l1`: A list of substrings from an input string.
- `n`: Integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k`: 0.
- `k0`: Integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `i`: The number of bits in the binary representation of `k_initial` (which is `k`, so `i` is 0 initially).
- `arr`: List of indices where the corresponding bit in `k_initial` is 1 (since `k` is 0, `arr` is an empty list).
- `c`: 0.
- `ans`: An empty list.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the elements in `arr`.
- For each iteration:
  - If `c` equals `n - 1`, it appends `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` and breaks out of the loop.
  - Otherwise, it appends `1 << i` to `ans` and increments `c` by 1.

### Conditions for Loop Execution:
- The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in `arr`.
- If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.
- If `arr` has elements, the loop will iterate over each element in `arr` until `c` equals `n - 1` or all elements in `arr` are processed.

### Given Output States:
- **After 1 iteration**: `arr` must have at least one element; `c` is 1; `ans` has one element equal to `1 << i`.
- **After 2 iterations**: `arr` must have at least two elements; `c` is 2; `ans` has two elements, each `1 << i`.
- **After 3 iterations**: `arr` must have at least three elements; `c` is 3; `ans` has three elements, each `1 << i`.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will execute until `c` equals `n - 1` or all elements in `arr` are processed.
- If `arr` has fewer elements than `n`, the loop will add `1 << i` for each element in `arr` and then add `k0 - sum(ans)` if `c` reaches `n - 1`.
- If `arr` has more than or equal to `n` elements, the loop will add `1 << i` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, then add `k0 - sum(ans)` and break.

### Determining the Final Output State:
- **Case 1**: If `arr` has fewer than `n` elements, the loop will add `1 << i` for each element in `arr` and then add `k0 - sum(ans)`.
- **Case 2**: If `arr` has `n` or more elements, the loop will add `1 << i` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, then add `k0 - sum(ans)` and break.

Given that `arr` is derived from the binary representation of `k`, and `k` is 0 initially, `arr` is empty. Therefore, the loop will not execute at all. However, if we assume `arr` is populated based on some other logic not provided here, we can generalize the final state.

### Final Calculation:
- If `arr` is empty, `ans` remains empty.
- If `arr` has elements, `ans` will have `1 << i` for each element in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, then add `k0 - sum(ans)`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `arr` has elements (as the problem states the loop executes multiple times):
- Suppose `arr` has elements `[0, 1, 2]` and `n` is 3, `k0` is 10.
- `ans` will be `[1 << 0, 1 << 1, 1 << 2]` which is `[1, 2, 4]`.
- `sum(ans)` is `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`.
- Since `c` is now `n - 1`, append `k0 - sum(ans)` which is `10 - 7 = 3`.
- Final `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, 3]`.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact contents of `arr`, we can only describe the general form.

### Final Output State:
Given the initial conditions and the loop behavior, the final output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing `1 << i` for each element in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`, then `k0 - sum(ans)` is appended if `c` reaches `n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain powers of 2 corresponding to the indices in `arr` until it reaches `n - 1` elements, and then it will append the difference between `k0` and the sum of the elements in `ans` if needed.
