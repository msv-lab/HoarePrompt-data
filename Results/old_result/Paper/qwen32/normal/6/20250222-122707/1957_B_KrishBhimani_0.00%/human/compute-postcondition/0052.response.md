The code snippet provided assigns the value `0` to the variable `i`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `i` changes from being the last element in `arr` to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a new list of substrings from the new input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `k0` is `k`; `i` is 0; `arr` is []; `c` is `n - 1`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` and the last element is `-sum(ans[:n-1])`.**
