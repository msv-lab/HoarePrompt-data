    #State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, with some elements possibly removed. `total_cost` is the total cost of buying `k` tickets. `tickets_bought` is `k`. `price_increase` is the cumulative increase in price per ticket due to buying `k` tickets.
    return total_cost
    #The program returns `total_cost`, which is the total cost of buying `k` tickets.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, given `n` ticket types with their respective prices in the `prices` list. It considers that up to `m` tickets can be bought at a time, and the price of each ticket increases by the number of tickets bought so far.
