Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while tickets_bought < k:
    price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
    price += price_increase
    tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
    total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
    tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
    price_increase += tickets_to_buy


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, with the smallest element removed. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `2 * tickets_to_buy`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`. `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k - tickets_bought).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples with one less element than before, where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `4 * tickets_to_buy` and must be less than `k`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase` plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`. `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k - tickets_bought) and must be such that `2 * tickets_to_buy < k`. `price_increase` is updated to `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples with one less element than before, where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is now `tickets_bought + tickets_to_buy`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase` plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`. `tickets_to_buy` is updated to min(m, k - tickets_bought). `price_increase` is now `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
