You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, given `n` ticket types with their respective prices in the `prices` list. It considers that up to `m` tickets can be bought at a time, and the price of each ticket increases by the number of tickets bought so far.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The given program follows a greedy approach to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of days `n`, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day `m`, and the total number of tickets `k` to be bought.
   - It also reads the list of prices `prices` for each day.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The program creates a priority queue (min-heap) `pq` where each element is a tuple containing the price and the day index. This allows the program to always buy tickets from the day with the lowest current price.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program initializes `total_cost` to 0, `tickets_bought` to 0, and `price_increase` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration:
     - It pops the day with the lowest current price from the heap.
     - It adds the `price_increase` to the price to account for the increased prices due to previous purchases.
     - It calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day, which is the minimum of `m` (maximum tickets per day) and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
     - It adds the cost of these tickets to `total_cost`.
     - It increments `tickets_bought` by the number of tickets bought on the current day.
     - It increases `price_increase` by the number of tickets bought on the current day, as this will increase the price of tickets on subsequent days.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the `total_cost`, which is the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

### Correctness:

The greedy approach ensures that the program always buys tickets from the day with the lowest current price, which is optimal because it minimizes the cost at each step. The use of a priority queue allows the program to efficiently find and update the lowest current price.

However, there is a critical issue with the provided program: it does not correctly handle the fact that the prices for subsequent days should be updated after each purchase. The current implementation updates the `price_increase` but does not reinsert the updated price back into the heap. This means that the heap does not reflect the correct prices for subsequent days after a purchase, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, after each purchase, the program should reinsert the updated price back into the heap. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        if tickets_bought < k:
            heapq.heappush(pq, (prices[day] + price_increase, day))
    return total_cost
```
