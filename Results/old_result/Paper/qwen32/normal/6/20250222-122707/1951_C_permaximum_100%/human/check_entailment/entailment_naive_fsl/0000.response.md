Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided code does not handle the problem description correctly in all cases. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that the price of tickets on subsequent days increases by the number of tickets purchased on the current day. The current implementation always pops the smallest price from the priority queue and buys the maximum allowed tickets (or the remaining tickets needed, whichever is smaller), without considering the future price increases.

Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 4
1 3 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
11
```

**Explanation:**
- On day 1, buy 2 tickets for a total cost of 2 * 1 = 2. The prices for the remaining days become [4, 5].
- On day 2, buy 1 ticket for a total cost of 1 * 4 = 4. The prices for the remaining day become [9].
- On day 3, buy 1 ticket for a total cost of 1 * 9 = 9.
- Total cost = 2 + 4 + 9 = 15.

However, the optimal strategy is:
- On day 1, buy 1 ticket for a total cost of 1 * 1 = 1. The prices for the remaining days become [4, 3].
- On day 2, buy 2 tickets for a total cost of 2 * 4 = 8. The prices for the remaining day become [6].
- On day 3, buy 1 ticket for a total cost of 1 * 6 = 6.
- Total cost = 1 + 8 + 6 = 15.

The current implementation would buy 2 tickets on day 1 and 2 tickets on day 2, resulting in a higher total cost:
- On day 1, buy 2 tickets for a total cost of 2 * 1 = 2. The prices for the remaining days become [4, 5].
- On day 2, buy 2 tickets for a total cost of 2 * 4 = 8. The prices for the remaining day become [9].
- Total cost = 2 + 8 = 10 (but we need 2 more tickets which would cost 18, making the total cost 20).

Thus, the code does not always find the minimum spending to purchase the required number of tickets, and it is incorrect.
