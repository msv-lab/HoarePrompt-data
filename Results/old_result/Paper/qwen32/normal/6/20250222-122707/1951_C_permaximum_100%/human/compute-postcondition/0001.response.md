The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place. This means that the structure of `pq` is rearranged to satisfy the heap property, where the smallest element is at the root of the heap. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the `heapq.heapify` operation.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index.**
