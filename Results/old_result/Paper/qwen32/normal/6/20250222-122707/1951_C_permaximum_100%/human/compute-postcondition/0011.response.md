The code snippet `price_increase += tickets_to_buy` increases the value of `price_increase` by the value of `tickets_to_buy`. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, with the smallest element removed. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `2 * tickets_to_buy`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`. `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k - tickets_bought).**
