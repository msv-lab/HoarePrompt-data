To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `tickets_bought < k` is true. Given the initial state, `tickets_bought` is 0, so we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought` and `k`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `tickets_bought < k`.
3. **Initial state analysis**: `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is an integer where `1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)`.
4. **Adjust the state**: Since `k` is already constrained to be within the range `1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)`, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `k`.

Given that `k` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0, the initial state is sufficient for the loop to execute.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.**
