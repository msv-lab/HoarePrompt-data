The code snippet `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` removes the smallest element from the heap `pq` and assigns it to the variables `price` and `day`. This means that the smallest tuple (which contains a price and its corresponding index) is popped from `pq`, and the values of `price` and `day` are updated to reflect the popped values.

Since the smallest element is removed from `pq`, the heap `pq` will have one less element compared to its initial state. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, `price_increase`, and `tickets_to_buy` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heapified list of tuples with one less element than before, where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`. `tickets_bought` is `2 * tickets_to_buy` and must be less than `k`. `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`. `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`. `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price from the original `pq`. `tickets_to_buy` is min(m, k - tickets_bought) and must be such that `2 * tickets_to_buy < k`.**
