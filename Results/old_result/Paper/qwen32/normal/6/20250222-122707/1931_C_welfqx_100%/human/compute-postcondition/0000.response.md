`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
