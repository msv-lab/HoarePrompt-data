The code snippet provided is `cn += 1`, which means the variable `cn` is incremented by 1. However, the initial state provided does not include the variable `cn`. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact value of `cn` after the operation. Assuming `cn` was defined and had a specific value before this operation, it would now be that value plus one.

Since `cn` is not part of the initial state, we can only describe the change in terms of `cn` being incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1; `n` is 2 (or greater); `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `i` is 2; `cn` is incremented by 1.**
