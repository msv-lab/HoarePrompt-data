Postcondition: **`f` is 1; `n` is greater than 5; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ii` is 5. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
