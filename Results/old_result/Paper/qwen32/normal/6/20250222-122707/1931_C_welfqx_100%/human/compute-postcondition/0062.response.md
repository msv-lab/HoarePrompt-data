Postcondition: **`ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]` up to `onum[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is the previous value of `cn` plus `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged.**
