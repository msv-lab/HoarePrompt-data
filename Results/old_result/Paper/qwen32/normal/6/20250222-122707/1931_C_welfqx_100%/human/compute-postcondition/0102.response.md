Postcondition: **`f` is 1; `n` is 2 (or greater); `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `i` is 1. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
