Output State: **`f` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`, `r` is the initial value of `r` plus (n - 1), `ii` is 1, `ck` is 3 if `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]` initially, otherwise `ck` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the value of `ck` is increased by 1. If `onum[ii]` was equal to `onum[ii + 1]` before this operation, `ck` becomes 3; otherwise, `ck` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
