Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is 0, `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, `f` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the values of `n`, `j`, `num[j]`, and `f` remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
