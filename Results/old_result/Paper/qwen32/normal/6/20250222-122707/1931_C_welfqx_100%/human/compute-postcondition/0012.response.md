Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `j` is incremented by 1, `f` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `f`, and the fact that `j` is incremented by 1 remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
