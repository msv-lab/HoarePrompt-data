Postcondition: **`f` is 1; `n` is the same; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is `n`; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`. Additionally, if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is increased by `n`.**
