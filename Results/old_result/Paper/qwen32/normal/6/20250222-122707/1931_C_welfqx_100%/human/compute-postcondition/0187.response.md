The code snippet `cn += ck` increments the value of `cn` by the value of `ck`. Therefore, `cn` now holds the sum of its previous value and the value of `ck`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **f is 1; n is the input integer; num is a list of integers from the input; onum is a reversed copy of num; symb1 is the first element of num; symb2 is the last element of num; symb1 is equal to symb2; cn is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of num plus the count of the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements starting from onum[0]; r is the initial value of r plus (n - 1); ck is the count of the longest sequence of consecutive equal elements starting from onum[0].**
