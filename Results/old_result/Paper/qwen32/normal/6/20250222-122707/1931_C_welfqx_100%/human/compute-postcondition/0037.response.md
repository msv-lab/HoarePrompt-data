The code snippet provided is `cn += 1`, which increments the value of the variable `cn` by 1. The initial state specifies the values and conditions for several variables, but only `cn` is affected by the provided code. 

Given that `cn` is either 1 or 2 based on the initial conditions provided, after the execution of `cn += 1`, `cn` will be either 2 or 3. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `num` is a list of integers read from the input, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` is `n - 1`, and `cn` is incremented by 1, making `cn` either 2 or 3.**
