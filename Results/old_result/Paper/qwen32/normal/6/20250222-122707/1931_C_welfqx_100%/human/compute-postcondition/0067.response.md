The code snippet provided reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `num`. This action does not affect the variables `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `cn`, `r`, `n`, or `f` directly, as they are not mentioned in the code snippet. The variable `n` is mentioned as an input integer in the initial state, but it is not modified by this line of code. The list `num` is newly introduced and populated with the input values.

Output State: **`ck` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from `onum[0]` up to `onum[n-2]` if all are equal, otherwise the count of consecutive equal elements until the first inequality is found. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is the previous value of `cn` plus `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged, `r` is the current value of `r` plus 1; `n` is an input integer; `f` is 1; `num` is a list of integers read from the input.**
