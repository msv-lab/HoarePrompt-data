To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for ii in range(n - 1):`. This means that the loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which implies that `n` must be greater than 1.

Let's analyze the variables in the loop head:
- `ii`: This is the loop variable and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- `n`: This is the upper limit for the loop variable `ii`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(n - 1)` will generate values from 0 to `n - 2`.

The other variables (`f`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`, `cn`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. They are part of the program state but do not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 1.

State: **`f` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `symb1` is the first element of `num`; `symb2` is the last element of `num`; `ck` is 1; `cn` is the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the first element of `num`**
