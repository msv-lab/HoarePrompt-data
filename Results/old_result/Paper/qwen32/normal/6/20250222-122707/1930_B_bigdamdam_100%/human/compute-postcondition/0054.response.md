The code snippet `p = [0] * n` changes the list `p` to a new list where all elements are `0`. The length of this new list is `n`. The values of `ind`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p` is a list of `n` zeros; `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (floor(n/2) - 1)`; `i` is `0`; `n` is the first integer from the input list.**
