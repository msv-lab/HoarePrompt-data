The code snippet takes the first integer from a space-separated list of integers provided as input. The initial state specifies that the input value for the loop must be at least 1. This precondition remains valid after the code has been executed.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the space-separated list of integers provided as input, and the input value for the loop must be at least 1.**
