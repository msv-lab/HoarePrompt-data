To determine the output of the `print(*p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `p`.

1. **Understanding the List `p`:**
   - The list `p` has `n` elements.
   - The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., `floor(n/2) * 2`) follow a specific pattern: `p[0] = n`, `p[2] = n-2`, `p[4] = n-4`, ..., `p[floor(n/2) * 2] = n - 2 * floor(n/2)`.
   - The elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ..., `n-1`) follow another pattern: `p[1] = 1 + n % 2`, `p[3] = 3 + n % 2`, `p[5] = 5 + n % 2`, ..., `p[n-1] = (n-1) + n % 2`.

2. **Constructing the List `p`:**
   - For even indices `i` (where `i = 0, 2, 4, ..., floor(n/2) * 2`), the value is `n - i`.
   - For odd indices `i` (where `i = 1, 3, 5, ..., n-1`), the value is `i + n % 2`.

3. **Example Construction:**
   - Let's take `n = 5` as an example.
     - `p[0] = 5` (since `0` is even, `n - 0 = 5`)
     - `p[1] = 1 + 5 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2` (since `1` is odd, `1 + 5 % 2 = 2`)
     - `p[2] = 5 - 2 = 3` (since `2` is even, `n - 2 = 3`)
     - `p[3] = 3 + 5 % 2 = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3` is odd, `3 + 5 % 2 = 4`)
     - `p[4] = 5 - 4 = 1` (since `4` is even, `n - 4 = 1`)
   - So, `p = [5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

4. **General Construction:**
   - For even indices, the values decrease from `n` by `2` each time.
   - For odd indices, the values increase by `2` starting from `1 + n % 2`.

5. **Printing the List `p`:**
   - The `print(*p)` statement will print all elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

**Output Description:**
Given the above construction, the list `p` will be constructed based on the value of `n` and the described patterns for even and odd indices. The exact values depend on the value of `n`, but the pattern is clear.

Output: **n, 1 + n % 2, n - 2, 3 + n % 2, n - 4, 5 + n % 2, ..., n - 2 * floor(n/2), (n-1) + n % 2** (where the values follow the described pattern based on the value of `n`).
