Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the value of `n`.**
