Reasoning:  
The given program generates a permutation for each test case as described in the problem statement. The approach involves filling the even indices with descending even numbers and the odd indices with ascending odd numbers. This strategy ensures that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (with `i < j`) satisfy the condition where `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.

Let's break down the logic:
1. For even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), the program fills the list with descending even numbers starting from `n`. This ensures that the largest numbers are placed at the beginning, reducing the likelihood of smaller numbers dividing larger ones later in the sequence.
2. For odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...), the program fills the list with ascending odd numbers starting from `1 + n % 2`. This ensures that the smallest odd numbers are placed in the odd positions, which are less likely to divide the numbers placed in the even positions.

This approach works because:
- The even indices are filled with larger numbers in descending order, making it less likely for these numbers to divide any of the numbers that follow them.
- The odd indices are filled with smaller numbers in ascending order, making it less likely for these numbers to divide any of the numbers that follow them.
- The combination of descending even numbers and ascending odd numbers ensures that no two numbers `p[i]` and `p[i+1]` can both divide `p[j]` and `p[j+1]` respectively for any `i < j`.

The execution summary aligns with the problem's requirements, and the provided example outputs are correct according to the problem's constraints.
