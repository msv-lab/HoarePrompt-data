Output State: **`p` is a list where the first element is `n`, the second element is 0, the third element is `n - 2`, the fourth element is `n - 4`, and the rest are zeros; `ind` is `n - 6`; `i` is 4; `n` is greater than 4.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, so if `ind` was initially `n - 4`, it is now `n - 6`. All other variables and the list `p` remain unchanged.
