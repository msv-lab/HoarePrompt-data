Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = [0] * n
    ind = n
    for i in range(0, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind -= 2
    ind = 1 + n % 2
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        p[i] = ind
        ind += 2
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[2]` is `n-2`, `p[4]` is `n-4`, ..., `p[floor(n/2) * 2]` is `n - 2 * floor(n/2)`, `p[1]` is `1 + n % 2`, `p[3]` is `3 + n % 2`, `p[5]` is `5 + n % 2`, ..., `p[n-1]` is `(n-1) + n % 2`; `ind` is `n + n % 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `p` is a list where the first `floor(n/2)` even indices are filled with values `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1)` and the odd indices are filled with values `1 + n % 2, 3 + n % 2, 5 + n % 2, ..., n-1 + n % 2`; `ind` is `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (floor(n/2) - 1)`; `i` is `n-2` if `n` is even or `n-1` if `n` is odd; `n` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `p` is a list where elements at even indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2*((n-1)//2) are `n`, `n-2`, `n-4`, ..., `n-2*((n-1)//2)` respectively, the elements at odd indices 1, 3, 5, ..., (n-1) are `1 + n % 2`, `3 + n % 2`, `5 + n % 2`, ..., `n-2 + n % 2` respectively, and the rest are zeros; `ind` is `n` if `n` is odd or `n-1` if `n` is even; `i` is `n-2` if `n` is odd or `n-1` if `n` is even; `n` is the same as the input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
