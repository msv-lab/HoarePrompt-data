The code snippet adds the variable `i` to the set `a`. Initially, `a` contains the element `i`, so adding `i` again will not change the set since sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Therefore, the set `a` remains unchanged, still containing the element `i`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain the same as they were initially.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing the element `i`; `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.
