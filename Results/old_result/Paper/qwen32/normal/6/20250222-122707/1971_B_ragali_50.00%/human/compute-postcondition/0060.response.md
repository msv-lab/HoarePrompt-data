The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it iterates over the string `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to the next character in `s` for the loop to execute one more time. The variables `s`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged according to the given information.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `s`, which means it has already been processed. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be updated to the subsequent character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to process, `i` is the next character in `s`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` includes the character `i`**.

However, to reflect the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the next character after the current `i` in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to process, `i` is the next character in `s` (after the current `i`), `t` remains unchanged, `a` includes the character `i` (from the previous iteration)**.

To be more precise, if `i` was at position `k` in the string `s`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be at position `k+1`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to process, `i` is the character at position `k+1` in `s`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` includes the character at position `k` in `s`**.

Since the exact position `k` is not specified, we can simply say:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to process, `i` is the next character in `s`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` includes the character `i` from the previous iteration**. 

But to clearly indicate the progression:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to process, `i` is the next character in `s` after the current `i`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` includes the character `i` from the previous iteration**.

For simplicity and adherence to the format:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to process, `i` is the next character in `s`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` includes the character `i`**.
