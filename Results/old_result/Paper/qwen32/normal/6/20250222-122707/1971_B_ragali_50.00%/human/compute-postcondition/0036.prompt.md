Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing no elements; if the length of the set `a` was greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`; if `newstr` is not equal to `s`, `newstr` is formed by rearranging the halves of `s`. Otherwise, `s` is a palindrome if `isreverse` is equal to `s`, and `s` is not a palindrome if `isreverse` is not equal to `s`; if the length of the set `a` was exactly one, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character; `i` is 4
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    a.add(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` contains all its previous elements plus the element `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` contains all its previous elements plus the element `i`, with duplicates removed; `i` is the next character in the string `s` to be processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the next character in the string `s` to be processed; `a` is a set that includes the character `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
