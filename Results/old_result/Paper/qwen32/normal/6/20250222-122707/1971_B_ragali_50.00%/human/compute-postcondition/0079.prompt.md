Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    s = input().strip(' ')
    a = set()
    for i in s:
        a.add(i)
    if len(a) > 1:
        print('YES')
        newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
        isreverse = s[::-1]
        if newstr != s:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
        elif isreverse != s:
            print(isreverse)
        else:
            print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`. If the length of the set `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, `newstr` is formed by rearranging the halves of `s`. Otherwise, `s` is a palindrome if `isreverse` is equal to `s`, and `s` is not a palindrome if `isreverse` is not equal to `s`. If the length of the set `a` is exactly one, the set `a` contains exactly one unique character.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`; `i` is the last character in the string `s` to be processed. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `newstr` is formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`. If `newstr` is different from `s`, no additional changes occur to `s`, `a`, `i`, or `isreverse`. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, no additional changes occur to `s`, `a`, `i`, or `isreverse`. If the length of `a` is 1 or less, no changes occur to `s`, `a`, or `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is `input_string.strip(' ')` if the set `a` of unique characters in `input_string.strip(' ')` has 1 or fewer elements; otherwise, `s` is `input_string.strip(' ')[len(input_string.strip(' ')) // 2:] + input_string.strip(' ')[:len(input_string.strip(' ')) // 2]`. `a` is a set of all unique characters in `input_string.strip(' ')`. `i` is the last character of `input_string.strip(' ')`. `t` remains unchanged. If `a` has more than one element, `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s` and `newstr` remains unchanged if `newstr` is not equal to `s`; otherwise, `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s` and `s` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
