Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:

1. **String `s`**: 
   - `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed.
   - Example: If the input string was `"  hello world  "`, `s` would be `"hello world"`.

2. **Set `a`**:
   - `a` is a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`.
   - Since `a` has a length greater than 1, `s` must contain at least two different characters.
   - Example: If `s` is `"hello world"`, `a` would be `{'h', 'e', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'r', 'd'}`.

3. **Character `i`**:
   - `i` is the last character in the string `s` to be processed.
   - Since no specific processing is mentioned, we can assume `i` is simply the last character of `s`.
   - Example: If `s` is `"hello world"`, `i` would be `"d"`.

4. **String `newstr`**:
   - `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`.
   - `newstr` is equal to `s`, which implies that `s` is a palindrome or a string that remains the same when its second half is concatenated with its first half.
   - Example: If `s` is `"abba"`, `newstr` would be `"bbaa" + "abba" = "abba"` (which is not possible unless `s` is a specific form, but given `newstr == s`, `s` must be a special form like `"abba"`).

5. **String `isreverse`**:
   - `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s`.
   - `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, which means `s` is not a palindrome.
   - Example: If `s` is `"hello"`, `isreverse` would be `"olleh"`.

### Code Analysis:

The print statement is:
```python
print(isreverse)
```

### Conclusion:

Given that `isreverse` is the reverse of the string `s` and `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, the output will be the reversed version of `s`.

### Output:

Output: **isreverse (where isreverse is the reverse of the string s)**

Since we don't have the exact value of `s`, we describe the output in terms of `s`.

However, if we need a concrete example based on the given conditions:

If `s` is `"hello"`, then `isreverse` would be `"olleh"`.

Output: **olleh** (for the example `s = "hello"`)

But strictly adhering to the format:

Output: **isreverse (where isreverse is the reverse of the string s)**
