The code snippet `a.add(i)` adds the character `i` to the set `a`. This means that the set `a` will now include the character `i` if it was not already present.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `i` is the next character in the string `s` to be processed; `a` is a set that includes the character `i`.**
