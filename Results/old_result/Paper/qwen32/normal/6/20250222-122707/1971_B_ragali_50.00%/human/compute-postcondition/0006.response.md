The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the characters in the string `s`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `i` to the next character in the string `s`.

Given that `i` is currently an element in the set `a` and `i` is also a character from the string `s`, we can infer that `i` is the character that was processed in the previous iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next character in the string. The variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged, and the set `a` might be updated to include the new character `i` if the loop body modifies it.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing the element `i` and possibly other elements processed so far; `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.

However, since the problem specifies only to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `s` is a non-empty input string with leading and trailing spaces removed; `a` is a set containing the element `i`; `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.
