Output State: **`c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers (or 0 if the last number was negative and `c` was reset), and `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`.**

Explanation: The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. The value of `c` remains unchanged as it represents the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers.
