Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the length of an array, an integer `k` representing the number of operations, and an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function processes these inputs and returns the result of performing `k` operations on the array.**
