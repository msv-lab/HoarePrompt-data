The variable `c` is reset to 0. The other variables (`maxi`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects this reset for `c`.

Output State: **`c` is 0; `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and the previous `c`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
