The code snippet `c += ele` adds the value of `ele` to the existing value of `c`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The variable `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the current `ele`, but its exact value is not specified, so we keep it as `ele`. The variable `c` now holds its previous value plus `ele`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the current `ele`, `c` is the previous value of `c` plus `ele`.**
