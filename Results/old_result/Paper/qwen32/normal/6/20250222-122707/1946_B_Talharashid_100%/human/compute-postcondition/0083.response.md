To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to understand the values and relationships of the variables involved based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `n` is the first integer from the input.
2. `k` is the second integer from the input.
3. `l` is the list of integers from the input.
4. `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers in `l` (or 0 if the last element was negative and `c` was reset).
5. `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`.
6. `i` is incremented by the length of the list `l`.

### Key Variables:
- `n` and `k` are integers provided as input.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers in `l`.
- `maxi` is the maximum value of `c` encountered so far.
- `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`.

### Calculation for the Print Statement:
The `print` statement computes:
\[ (2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007 \]

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate \(2^k\)**: This is straightforward; it's 2 raised to the power of `k`.
2. **Multiply \(2^k\) by `maxi`**: This gives us \(2^k \times \text{maxi}\).
3. **Subtract `maxi` from the result**: This gives us \(2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi}\).
4. **Add `sum(l)` to the result**: This gives us \(2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)\).
5. **Take the result modulo \(1000000007\)**: This ensures the result is within the bounds of the problem.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the operations described, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **\((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007\)** (where `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers in `l`, and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`).
