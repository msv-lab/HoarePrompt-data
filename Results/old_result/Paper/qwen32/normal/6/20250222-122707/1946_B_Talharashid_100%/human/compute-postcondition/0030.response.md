The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores them in a list `l`. This operation does not affect the variables `c`, `maxi`, `i`, `n`, or `k` directly.

Output State: **`c` is the sum of the last contiguous subsequence of non-negative numbers (or 0 if the last number was negative and `c` was reset); `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers from the input.**
