The code snippet updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. Since `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0, the maximum of these two values is 0. Therefore, `maxi` remains 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers with at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is a negative integer, and the current value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
