To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the list `l` and the variable `ele`. The loop will execute if and only if the list `l` contains at least one element. The variables `n`, `k`, `c`, `maxi`, and `i` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the loop statement:
```
for ele in l:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The key variable here is `l`, which must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The variable `ele` will be assigned the value of the first element in `l` during the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `l` has at least one integer. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `l` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer**.
