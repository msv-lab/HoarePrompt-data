Output State: **`c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is `max(ele_next, 0)`, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, where `ele` is the third element in the list.**

In simple terms, the value of `c` has been updated to its previous value plus `ele`. The value of `maxi` remains as `max(ele_next, 0)`. The values of `n` and `k` have not changed, and `l` still contains at least 3 integers with `ele` being the third element in the list.
