Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `l` is a list of integers from the input that must contain at least one integer. Additionally, either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and `ele`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
