The code snippet updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current value of `maxi` and the current value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers with values ranging from -10^9 to 10^9, `l` is a list containing `n` integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `c` is `c + ele`, `maxi` is the maximum of the current `c` and the previous `maxi`. Either `ele` is not less than 0, or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`.**
