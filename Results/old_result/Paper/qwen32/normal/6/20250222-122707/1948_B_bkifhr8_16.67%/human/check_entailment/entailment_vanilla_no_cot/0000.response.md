Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program does not fully consider all cases where an element needs to be split to achieve a sorted array. The current implementation only checks if the current element is greater than the next one and greater than 10, and it splits the current element only once. However, the problem requires the operation to be performed any number of times until the array is sorted.

Here are the issues with the current implementation:
1. The program only performs a single split operation for each pair of elements that are out of order and does not continue to check if further splits are needed.
2. The program does not handle the case where splitting an element results in multiple digits that need to be inserted back into the list.
3. The program does not ensure that all elements are checked and split as necessary to achieve a sorted array.

To fix the program, we need to repeatedly check and split elements until the array is sorted or no further splits can be made. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_sort_by_splitting(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        new_lst = []
        for num in lst:
            if num >= 10:
                new_lst.extend(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
                changed = True
            else:
                new_lst.append(num)
        lst = new_lst
        if lst == sorted(lst):
            return True
    return False

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_sort_by_splitting(lst):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version of the program repeatedly checks and splits elements until the array is sorted or no further splits can be made. It ensures that all elements are checked and split as necessary to achieve a sorted array.
