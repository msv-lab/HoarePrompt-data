The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This affects the variable `a` directly, while `t` and `n` remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value provided by the second input; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line.**
