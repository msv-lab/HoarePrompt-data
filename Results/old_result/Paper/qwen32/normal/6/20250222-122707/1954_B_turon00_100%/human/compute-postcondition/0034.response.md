The code snippet `tmp = a[0]` reassigns the variable `tmp` to the first element of the list `a`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is the integer provided by the input; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` if the loop ends with such a sequence, otherwise 0; `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
