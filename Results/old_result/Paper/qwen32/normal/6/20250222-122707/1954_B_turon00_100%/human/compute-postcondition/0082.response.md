The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. This change affects the value of `cnt` directly, but does not change the values of other variables. The value of `ans` depends on the previous value of `cnt` and `n`, but since `cnt` is reset, `ans` will be recalculated based on the new value of `cnt` (which is 0) in the next logical step of the program, if such a step exists. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt` if `ans` was `n` before, or `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` if `ans` was not `n` before; `t` remains 2, `n` is an input integer greater than `i + 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
