The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially set to `n`, and `cnt` is initially set to `0`.

Since `cnt` is `0` and `ans` is `n`, and `1 <= n <= 10^4`, it follows that `0` is always less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to `0`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 0; the element `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
