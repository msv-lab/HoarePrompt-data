### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to understand if the original assessment is accurate.

The code's logic is based on finding the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements. The idea is that if the minimum length of such a subarray is greater than 1, then removing one element from such a subarray should make the array non-beautiful. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to break the beautiful property of the array.

### Counterexample Analysis:

Let's revisit the counterexample provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 2 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- The array is beautiful because we can perform the operation to make all elements the same. However, removing one element (e.g., the middle `2`) will make the array `[1, 2, 1, 1]` which is not beautiful because no operation can make all elements the same.

**Actual Output of the Code:**
```
-1
```

**Explanation of the Actual Output:**
- The code incorrectly determines that the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. The issue arises because the logic in the code does not correctly handle the requirement to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Identify Patterns:** We need to identify patterns in the array where elements can be made the same using the allowed operation. This involves finding segments where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` and `a_i` can be replaced.
2. **Break the Pattern:** We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break these patterns. This involves checking different segments and finding the smallest set of elements whose removal will disrupt the beautiful property.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements, which is insufficient. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in identifying that the code is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
