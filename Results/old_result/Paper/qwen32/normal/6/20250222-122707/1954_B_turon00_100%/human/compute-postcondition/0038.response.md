Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is `n`. Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`. The current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
