The code snippet initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`) are modified by this code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp` remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is the integer value provided by the second input; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0.**
