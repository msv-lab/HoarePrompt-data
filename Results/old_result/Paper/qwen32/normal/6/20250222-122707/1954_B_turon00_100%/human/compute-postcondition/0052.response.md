The code snippet provided sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect any other variables directly, so all other conditions and values remain as specified in the initial state. The only change is that `cnt` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input minus 1, where 0 <= `t` <= 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is the new list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 2 if it was 1, or `cnt` is 1 if it was 0, and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0; Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n` or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`; `i` is `t + 2`; `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`; `cnt` is 0.**
