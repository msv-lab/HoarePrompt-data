The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to the integer value provided by the input. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. After the execution of the code, `t` will hold the specific integer value provided by the input, and the other conditions regarding `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
