The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since the loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation, the only variable we need to adjust is `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been 1 (since it will be decremented to 0 after the current iteration, which means no further iterations will occur). To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`, no further changes are made to `ans` and `n`. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`. `t` is 2**
