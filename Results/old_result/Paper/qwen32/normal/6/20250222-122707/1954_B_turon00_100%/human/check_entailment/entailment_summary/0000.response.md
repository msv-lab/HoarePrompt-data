### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and how it aligns with the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Consecutive Elements**: It then iterates through the array `a` to count the lengths of consecutive segments of equal elements. This is done using the variables `tmp` (to track the current element being compared) and `cnt` (to count the length of the current segment).

3. **Finding Minimum Segment Length**: As it iterates through the array, if it encounters a different element, it updates the `ans` variable to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt` (the length of the just-ended segment). After the loop, it also updates `ans` with the last segment's length.

4. **Checking Conditions**: Finally, it checks if the array has only one element (`n == 1`) or if the entire array is a single segment of equal elements (`ans == n`). In either case, it outputs `-1` because such arrays cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Otherwise, it outputs `ans`, which is the length of the shortest segment of consecutive equal elements.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Logic**: The logic correctly identifies the shortest segment of consecutive equal elements, as required by the problem. Removing any element from this segment will break the beautiful property of the array.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately:
  - Arrays with only one element (`n == 1`) are correctly identified as impossible to make non-beautiful.
  - Arrays where all elements are the same (`ans == n`) are also correctly identified as impossible to make non-beautiful.

- **Efficiency**: The program processes each test case in O(n) time, which is efficient given the constraints (the sum of all `n` does not exceed 300,000).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
