The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 again from its current value.

Given:
- `t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4;
- `n` is greater than 0;
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line;
- `tmp` is `a[0]`;
- `i` is incremented by 1.

If `i` was 1 at the end of the last iteration (meaning the loop just finished its first iteration), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `i` is 2**.
