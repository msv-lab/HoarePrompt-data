The code snippet `cnt = 0` resets the variable `cnt` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is the integer value provided by the input, 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers provided by the third input line; `tmp` is `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is 0; the element `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
