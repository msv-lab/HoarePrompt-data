Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**

In this output state, the variable `mod_x_key` has been assigned the value of `num % x`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
