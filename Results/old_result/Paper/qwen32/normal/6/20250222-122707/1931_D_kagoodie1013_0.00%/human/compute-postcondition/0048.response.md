The code snippet provided updates the value of `mod_y_key` to be the result of `num % y`. No other variables are affected by this single line of code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers a; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` as the key and its value incremented by 1; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` as the key and its value incremented by 1; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are updated to the values of the next tuple in `test_cases`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `num` is the next element in `arr`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`. `mod_y_key` is now `num % y`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `mod_y_key` has been updated to `num % y`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
