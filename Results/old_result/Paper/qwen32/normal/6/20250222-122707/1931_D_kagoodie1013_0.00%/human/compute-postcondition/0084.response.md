To determine the new state after the provided code snippet, we need to update the value of `count` based on the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` and their corresponding mappings in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`.

Given:
- `count` is initially 2.
- `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 2.
- `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2.
- `mod_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.
- `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.

The code snippet:
```python
count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
```

We need to find the new value of `count` after this operation. The new value of `count` will be the sum of its current value and the values obtained from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y`, respectively.

Since `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` both have the value `2` for their respective keys, and assuming `mod_x` and `mod_y` are keys that exist in these maps (if not, they would default to `0`), the new value of `count` will be:
```python
count = 2 + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
count = 2 + 2 + 2
count = 6
```

Thus, the new value of `count` is `6`. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code snippet, which they are not.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one more tuple; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previous values of `count` if any; `count` is 6; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 2; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2; `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the next tuple in `test_cases` where `arr` must have at least two elements; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `num` is the next element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**
