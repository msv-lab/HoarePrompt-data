Let's break down the loop and understand what happens after all iterations are completed.

The loop iterates over each `num` in the list `arr`. For each `num`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`, updates `count` based on the current values in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, and then updates these maps with the current `num`.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `count` starts at 0.
   - `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are empty dictionaries.

2. **For each `num` in `arr`**:
   - Calculate `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
   - Update `count` by adding the values from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` corresponding to `mod_x` and `mod_y`.
   - Update `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` by incrementing the counts for `num % x` and `num % y`.

3. **After all iterations**:
   - `count` will hold the final count of pairs `(i, j)` such that `-(arr[i] % x) == arr[j] % y` for all `i < j`.
   - `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will contain the frequency of each possible `num % x` and `num % y` in the array `arr`.

The final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

- `test_cases` remains a list of tuples as given initially.
- `results` will contain the final value of `count`.
- `count` will be the final count after all iterations.
- `mod_x_map` will contain the frequency of each `num % x` in `arr`.
- `mod_y_map` will contain the frequency of each `num % y` in `arr`.
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` will reflect the values of the last tuple processed in `test_cases`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `count` is the final count after all iterations, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `num % x` in `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `num % y` in `arr`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the values of the last tuple in `test_cases`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `results` will have the final count of valid pairs `(i, j)` as per the conditions, and `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` will reflect the frequency of remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. The other variables will retain their state as described.
