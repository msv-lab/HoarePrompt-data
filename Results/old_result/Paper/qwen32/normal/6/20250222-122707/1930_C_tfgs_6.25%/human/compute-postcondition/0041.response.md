The code snippet `ans.append(a[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the list `ans`. This operation modifies `ans` by adding a new element to it, but it does not affect the values of `a`, `counter`, `cnt`, or `adv`.

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `counter` is a `Counter` object, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` where `n` is at least the length of `a`, `ans` is a list with the additional element `a[i]` appended, `i` is `i + 1`, `adv` remains unchanged. If `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] > a[i] + 1` and `counter[a[i - 1]] > adv`, then `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv`, and `ans` has elements `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv` appended. Otherwise, no changes are made to `counter`, `cnt`, or `ans` except for the appended element `a[i]`.**
