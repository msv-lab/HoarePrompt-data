To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the effect of each iteration on the array `a`. The loop iterates `n` times, and during each iteration `i`, the element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`.

Let's break down the changes:
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `a[0]` is incremented by `0 + 1 = 1`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `a[1]` is incremented by `1 + 1 = 2`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `a[2]` is incremented by `2 + 1 = 3`.
- This pattern continues until the `n`-th iteration (`i = n-1`), where `a[n-1]` is incremented by `(n-1) + 1 = n`.

Thus, after all `n` iterations, each element `a[i]` in the array `a` will have been incremented by `i + 1` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

Hence, the final output state of the array `a` will be:
- `a[0]` will be `a[0] + 1`
- `a[1]` will be `a[1] + 2`
- `a[2]` will be `a[2] + 3`
- ...
- `a[n-1]` will be `a[n-1] + n`

Output State: **Each element `a[i]` in the array `a` is incremented by `i + 1` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.**
