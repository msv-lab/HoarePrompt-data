To determine the output of the `print(*ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the construction of the `ans` list.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`a` remains unchanged**: This means `a` is a predefined list of elements, and it will not be modified.
2. **`counter` is a `Counter` object with all values decremented to 0**: This implies that `counter` might have been used for counting elements, but now all its counts are zero. This detail doesn't directly affect the `ans` list.
3. **`cnt` is 0**: This is a simple integer variable initialized to 0.
4. **`ans` is constructed as follows**:
   - It starts with all elements from `a`.
   - Additional elements are inserted between them based on the difference between consecutive elements in `a` and the initial count `cnt` (which is 0 in this case).
   - Finally, `cnt` elements are added to the end of `ans`, each being the last element of `ans` minus 1, sequentially.

### Step-by-Step Construction of `ans`:
1. **Initialization**: `ans` is initialized with all elements from `a`. Let's denote `a` as `[a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`. Therefore, `ans` starts as `[a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`.
2. **Inserting Additional Elements**: Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements are inserted between the elements of `a` based on the difference between consecutive elements.
3. **Appending `cnt` Elements**: Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements are appended to the end of `ans`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `cnt` is 0, the `ans` list remains exactly the same as the `a` list. Therefore, the `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the `a` list separated by spaces.

### Output:
Output: **a1 a2 a3 ... an (where a1, a2, a3, ..., an are the elements of the list `a`)**

Since the exact elements of `a` are not provided, we describe the output in terms of the elements of `a`. If specific elements of `a` were provided, we could substitute them in the output.
