Postcondition: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `counter` is a `Counter` object, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` where `n` is at least the length of `a`, `ans` is an empty list if `i` is not greater than 0. If `i` is greater than 0, `a` is unchanged, `counter` has its element at index `a[i - 1]` decremented by `adv`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, and `ans` contains `[a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv]`. `i` and `adv` remain unchanged.**
