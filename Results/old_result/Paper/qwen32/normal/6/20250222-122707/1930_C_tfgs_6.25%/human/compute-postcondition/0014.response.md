The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the range is determined by `len(a)`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `a` has at least one element, as `len(a)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start.

Here are the necessary adjustments:

- `a` should be a list with at least one element.
- `counter` should be a `Counter` object that holds the frequency of each element in the original modified array `a` before duplicates were removed. However, this doesn't directly affect the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust it further for the loop to execute.
- `cnt` is `n - len(a)`. Since `len(a)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, `n` can be any integer greater than or equal to the length of `a`.
- `ans` is an empty list and does not affect the loop execution directly.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `a` has at least one element.

State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `counter` is a `Counter` object, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` where `n` is at least the length of `a`, `ans` is an empty list**
