Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array `a`. The function is called multiple times (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) with different test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function returns the result for each test case based on the provided array elements.**
