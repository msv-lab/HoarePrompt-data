Postcondition: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `counter` is a `Counter` object, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` where `n` is at least the length of `a`, `ans` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `adv` remains unchanged. If `i > 0` and `a[i - 1] > a[i] + 1` and `counter[a[i - 1]] > adv`, then `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - adv`, and `ans` has elements `a[i - 1] - 1`, `a[i - 1] - 2`, ..., `a[i - 1] - adv` appended. Otherwise, no changes are made to `counter`, `cnt`, or `ans`.**
