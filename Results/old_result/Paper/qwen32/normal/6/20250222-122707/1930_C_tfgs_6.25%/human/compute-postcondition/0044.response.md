The value of `adv` is updated to be the minimum of `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged in their described states.

Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `counter` is a `Counter` object, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list, `i` is `i`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`.**
