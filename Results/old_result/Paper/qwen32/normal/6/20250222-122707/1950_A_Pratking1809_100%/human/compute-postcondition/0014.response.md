The `print('STAIR')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, or `i` as it directly prints the string `'STAIR'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is given as `print('STAIR')`.
2. The string `'STAIR'` is explicitly provided within the `print` function.
3. None of the variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, `i`) are used within this `print` statement.
4. Therefore, the output will be the exact string `'STAIR'`.

Output: **STAIR**
