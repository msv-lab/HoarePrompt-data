Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` is greater than 0; `i` is 2. If `a < b < c`, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.**

This can be simplified to:

Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9; `q` is greater than 0; `i` is 2. Regardless of whether `a < b < c` is true or false, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged.**
