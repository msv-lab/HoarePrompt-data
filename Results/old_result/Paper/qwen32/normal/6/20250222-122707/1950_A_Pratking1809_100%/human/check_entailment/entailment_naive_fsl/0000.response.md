Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic as per the problem description. It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads three digits. It then checks if the digits form a "STAIR" (a < b < c), a "PEAK" (a < b > c), or neither. The program handles all possible combinations of the three digits and outputs the correct result based on the conditions specified. There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle, and it works correctly for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.
