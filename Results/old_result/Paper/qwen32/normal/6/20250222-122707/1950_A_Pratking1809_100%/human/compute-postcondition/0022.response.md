The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'PEAK'`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
   - `q` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('PEAK')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'PEAK'`.
   - None of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, or `i` are referenced in the `print` statement.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
