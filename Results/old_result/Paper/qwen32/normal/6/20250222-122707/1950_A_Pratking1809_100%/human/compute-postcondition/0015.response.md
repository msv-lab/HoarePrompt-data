The given `print` statement is `print('PEAK')`. This statement directly prints the string 'PEAK' to the output, regardless of the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `q`, and `i` as described in the initial state.

Since the string 'PEAK' is explicitly provided in the `print` statement, there is no need to consider the values of the other variables to determine the output.

Output: **PEAK**
