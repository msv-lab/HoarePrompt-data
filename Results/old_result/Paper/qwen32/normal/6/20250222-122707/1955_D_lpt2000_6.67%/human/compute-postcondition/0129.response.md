The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `aa`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet. The variable `nabors` remains as `nabors + 1`.

Output State: **`nabors` is `nabors + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers read from input.**
