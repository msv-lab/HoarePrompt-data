Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is `nabors + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers read from input, `bb` is a list of integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_aa` after removing the counts that are in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_bb` after removing the counts that are in `D`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is `1` if `tot >= k` else `0`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nabors` is `nabors + 1`, `n` is an input integer such that `n >= m`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers read from input with at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `bb` is a list of integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with `D[out_aa]` decremented by 1 if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `E` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_aa` after removing the counts that are in `D`, `C` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_bb` after removing the counts that are in `D` with `C[out_aa]` incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was 0 and `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, and `fnd` is `2` if `tot >= k` else `1`. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `C[in_aa]` is either `D[in_aa] + 1` or `C[in_aa]` remains unchanged, and `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was not equal to `D[in_aa]`. If `C[in_aa]` is 0, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is 0 and `D[out_aa]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nabors` is `nabors + 1`, `n` is an input integer such that `n >= m`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers read from input with at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `bb` is a list of integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with `D[out_aa]` decremented by 1 if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `E` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_aa` after removing the counts that are in `D` with `E[out_aa]` decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `C` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_bb` after removing the counts that are in `D` with `C[out_aa]` incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was 0 and `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, and `fnd` is 3 if `tot >= k` else 2, `in_aa` is `aa[nabors + 1]`, `out_aa` is `aa[nabors - m + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nabors` is `nabors + 2`, `n` is an input integer such that `n >= m`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers read from input with at least `max(m, n - m)` elements, `bb` is a list of integers read from input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `bb`, `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with `D[out_aa]` decremented by 1 if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `E` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_aa` after removing the counts that are in `D` with `E[out_aa]` decremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `C` is a Counter object containing the counts of integers in `cnt_bb` after removing the counts that are in `D` with `C[out_aa]` incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was 0 and `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 4 if `tot >= k` else 3, `in_aa` is `aa[nabors + 2]`, `out_aa` is `aa[nabors - m + 2]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
