The code snippet reads three integers from the input, splits them, converts each to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `nabors` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input.**
