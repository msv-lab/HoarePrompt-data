The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value provided by the user input. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` by incrementing it by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the values of `s`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `x`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `x + 1`. However, since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can represent the state with `i` incremented by 1 from its previous value.

State: **`s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first word in `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second word in `s`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**. 

To make it more concrete, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 2, then at the start of the next iteration `i` will be 3. But without the specific value, the most accurate representation is:

State: **`s` is the string input by the user; `a` is the integer value of the first word in `s`; `b` is the integer value of the second word in `s`; `i` is incremented by 1**.
