You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: `i` is `t`, `s` is the last string input, `a` is the first integer from the last string input, and `b` is the second integer from the last string input.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `i` is `t`, `s` is the last string input, `a` is the first integer from the last string input, and `b` is the second integer from the last string input. The sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then prints "bob" if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints "alice".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The logic in the code is incorrect because it only checks if the sum of the coins `(a + b)` is even or odd, and then prints "bob" or "alice" accordingly. However, the game rules and the optimal strategy of both players are more complex than just the parity of the sum of the coins.

Here’s a counterexample to demonstrate why the code is incorrect:

**Input:**
```
1
2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
- Alice can choose to swap wallets, so now Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 2 coins.
- Bob has to swap wallets, so now Alice has 2 coins and Bob has 1 coin again.
- Alice can choose to not swap and remove 1 coin, so now Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 1 coin.
- Bob can choose to not swap and remove 1 coin, so now Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 0 coins.
- Alice can choose to not swap and remove 1 coin, so now Alice has 0 coins and Bob has 0 coins.
- Bob cannot make a move, so Alice wins.

**Actual Output of the Provided Code:**
```
bob
```

This shows that the code does not correctly determine the winner for all cases. The provided code needs a more sophisticated strategy to determine the winner based on the optimal play by both Alice and Bob.
