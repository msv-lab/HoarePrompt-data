The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The variable `i` is mentioned in the initial state but is not affected by the given code snippet. The number of test cases `T` is also mentioned but remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is `i + 1`.** 

In natural language: The number of test cases `T` remains unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are now the two integers read from the input. The value of `i` remains `i + 1` as it was not modified by the code snippet.
