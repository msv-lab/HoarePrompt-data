The given initial state describes several variables and their properties, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables and Their Descriptions:**
   - `T`: An integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `a` and `b`: Integers read from the input.
   - `i`: An integer that is incremented by 1 (though the exact value of `i` is not used in the `print` statement).

2. **The `print` Statement:**
   - The statement `print('Bob')` outputs the string `'Bob'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`, the output is simply the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
