To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's carefully analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided.

### Initial State:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet directly prints the string `'Bob'`. The values of `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement because it is not using any of these variables. The statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.

### Output:
Output: **Bob**
