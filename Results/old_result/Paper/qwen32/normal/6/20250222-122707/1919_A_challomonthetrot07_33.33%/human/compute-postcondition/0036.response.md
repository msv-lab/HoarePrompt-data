Let's analyze the given task step-by-step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

2. **Code to Execute:**
   ```python
   print('Alice')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.
   - The variables `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the provided `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of these variables.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`, the output will be exactly that.

Output: **Alice**
