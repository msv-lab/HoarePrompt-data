Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. Whether `a` is greater than `b` or not, the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, and the increment of `i` remain consistent with the initial conditions.**
