Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` equals `b`, no specific actions are performed within the if block. Otherwise, if `b` equals 1, specific actions within the else block are performed. In all cases, `T`, `a`, and `b` retain their values as described, with `i` incremented by 1.**
