### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code, and compare it with the original assessment.

1. **Case 1: `a == b`**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `a == b`, Bob wins because Alice can always mirror Bob's moves.
   - **Annotation**: `if a == b: print('Bob')`
   - **Conclusion**: Correct.

2. **Case 2: `a == 1`**
   - The program correctly identifies that if Alice starts with 1 coin, she will lose regardless of Bob's actions.
   - **Annotation**: `elif a == 1: print('Alice')`
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect, it should be `elif a == 1: print('Bob')` as Alice cannot make a move and will lose.

3. **Case 3: `b == 1`**
   - The program correctly identifies that if Bob starts with 1 coin, he can always force Alice into a losing position.
   - **Annotation**: `elif b == 1: print('Bob')`
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect, it should be `elif b == 1: print('Alice')` as Bob cannot make a move and will lose.

4. **Case 4: `a % 2 == 1`**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `a` is odd, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
   - **Annotation**: `elif a % 2 == 1: print('Bob')`
   - **Conclusion**: Correct.

5. **Case 5: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.
   - **Annotation**: `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1: print('Alice')`
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect, it should be `elif b % 2 == 1: print('Alice')` as the condition `a % 2 == 0` is redundant since the previous conditions have already handled `a == 1` and `a % 2 == 1`.

6. **Case 6: `a > b`**
   - The program incorrectly identifies that if `a > b`, Bob wins. This is not always true because the parity of `a` and `b` also matters.
   - **Annotation**: `elif a > b: print('Bob')`
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect. It should consider the parity of `a` and `b`.

7. **Case 7: `else`**
   - The program incorrectly identifies that if none of the above conditions are met, Alice wins. This is not always true because the parity of `a` and `b` also matters.
   - **Annotation**: `else: print('Alice')`
   - **Conclusion**: Incorrect. It should consider the parity of `a` and `b`.

### Corrected Logic:
- If `a == b`, Bob wins.
- If `a == 1`, Bob wins.
- If `b == 1`, Alice wins.
- If `a` is odd, Bob wins.
- If `b` is odd, Alice wins.
- If both `a` and `b` are even, the player with the smaller number of coins loses. If `a < b`, Alice wins; if `a > b`, Bob wins.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a < b:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect handling of cases where `a == 1`, `b == 1`, and the logic involving the parity of `a` and `b` when both are even.

**Final: False**
