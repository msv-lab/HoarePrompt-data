Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is equal to `b`, their values remain unchanged. If `a` is not equal to `b`, their values and parities remain unchanged, and the relationship between `a` and `b` (whether `a` is greater than `b` or not) is preserved.**
