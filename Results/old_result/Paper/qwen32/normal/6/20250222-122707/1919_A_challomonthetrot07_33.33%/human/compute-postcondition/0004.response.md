To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the `print` statement.

Initial State:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The current value of `a` is equal to the current value of `b`.

The `print` statement:
```python
print('Bob')
```

From the initial state, we know:
- The value of `T` does not affect the `print` statement directly.
- The values of `a` and `b` are equal, but their specific values are not provided.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`. It does not depend on the values of `T`, `a`, or `b`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
