Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is not equal to 1, and `a` is even. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, then `b` is odd. Otherwise, either `a` is odd or `b` is even; if `a` is greater than `b`, then the current value of `a` is greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
