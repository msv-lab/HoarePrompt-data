Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain consistent with the initial conditions regardless of whether the condition `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` is true or false.**
