The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Alice'. The initial state provides some information about variables `T`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of these variables does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
   - `a` is an integer with the current value of 1.
   - `b` is an integer read from the input, and `a` is not equal to `b`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   - The code snippet consists of a single `print` statement: `print('Alice')`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement directly outputs the string 'Alice' to the console.
   - The variables `T`, `a`, and `b` are not used in this statement, so their values do not influence the output.

4. **Output:**
   - The output of the `print` statement is the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
