The given initial state describes several variables and their roles, but the `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

However, none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:
Output: **Bob**
