The initial state provides several conditions about the variables `T`, `a`, and `b`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in the given code snippet. The `print` statement is straightforward and simply outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `a` and `b` are integers with specific conditions (e.g., `a` is even, `b` is odd, and neither is equal to 1 or each other).
- The `print` statement outputs the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of `T`, `a`, or `b`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values, the output will be the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
