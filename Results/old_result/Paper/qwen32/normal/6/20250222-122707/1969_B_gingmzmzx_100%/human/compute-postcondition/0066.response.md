Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string and must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]` with one of its elements incremented by 2 if `c` was the previously incremented element, or `[1, 1]` if `c` was the opposite element, `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.**
