To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. In this case, the loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `n`. The loop will execute if and only if `n` is greater than 0. The other variables `t` and `s` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `s` is a binary string with length 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5
- `n` is an input integer

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 0. The values of `t` and `s` do not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a binary string with length 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5, `n` must be greater than 0**
