The code snippet converts the binary string `s` into a list of integers by mapping each character in the string to its integer value. The length of the string `s` remains the same, but its type changes from a string to a list of integers. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string, `n` must be greater than 0**.
