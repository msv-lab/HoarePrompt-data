The code provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This means that the value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided as input. The other variables `t` and `s` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and '1's) with length 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of lengths of all strings `s` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `n` is an input integer.**
