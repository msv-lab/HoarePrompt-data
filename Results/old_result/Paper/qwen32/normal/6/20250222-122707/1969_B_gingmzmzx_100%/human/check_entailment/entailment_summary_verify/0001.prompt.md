You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple binary strings, each representing a test case, and for each string, it calculates and prints a score based on the arrangement of '0's and '1's in the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem of determining the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r-l+1` is `r-l+1`.

### Program Analysis

The provided program works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the binary string and converts it into a list of integers.
3. It counts the total number of zeroes in the string.
4. It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
5. It initializes `ans` to store the total cost.
6. It iterates through the string:
   - If the current character is `0`, it adds `1` to `ans` if there is at least one `1` encountered so far.
   - If the current character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (total zeroes minus the count of zeroes encountered so far) to `ans`.

### Correctness Evaluation

Let's evaluate whether the program correctly calculates the minimum cost:
- The program seems to be attempting to count the number of inversions in the string, which would be the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `s[i] > s[j]`. This is a common approach for determining the minimum number of swaps needed to sort a binary string.
- However, the cost of each operation is the length of the substring being cyclically shifted, not just the number of inversions. The program does not account for the length of the substring being shifted, which is crucial for determining the actual cost.

### Detailed Reasoning

Consider the example `101011`:
- The correct strategy involves multiple operations:
  - Shift `[1, 3]` to get `011011` (cost 3).
  - Shift `[2, 4]` to get `001111` (cost 3).
- The total cost is 6, not 5 as the program would output.

The program's logic for counting inversions is correct, but the cost calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the length of the substring being shifted.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the cost based on the length of the substring being cyclically shifted.
