The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the element `c` in the list `cnt`. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s`, which consists of binary digits (0s and 1s), `cnt` is a list that keeps track of the counts of 0s and 1s. Specifically, `cnt[0]` counts the number of 0s and `cnt[1]` counts the number of 1s.

If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`, `ans` is unchanged.**
