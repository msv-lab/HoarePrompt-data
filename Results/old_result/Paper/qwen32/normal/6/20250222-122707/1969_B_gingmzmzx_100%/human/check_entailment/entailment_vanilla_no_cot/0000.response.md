Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the described cyclic shift operations. The logic in the program does not accurately reflect the cost calculation for the required operations.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine the cost of transforming the string into a sorted form by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted. The optimal strategy involves counting the minimum number of operations needed to move all 1s to the end of the string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        cost = 0
        ones = 0
        for c in s:
            if c == '1':
                ones += 1
            elif c == '0' and ones > 0:
                cost += ones
        print(cost)
```

Explanation of the corrected program:
1. We iterate through the string.
2. We count the number of '1's encountered (`ones`).
3. Whenever we encounter a '0' and there are '1's before it (`ones > 0`), we add the count of '1's to the cost. This is because each '0' needs to "push" all the '1's that have been counted so far to the right, incurring a cost equal to the number of '1's encountered so far.
4. Finally, we print the total cost for each test case.

This approach ensures that we correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.
