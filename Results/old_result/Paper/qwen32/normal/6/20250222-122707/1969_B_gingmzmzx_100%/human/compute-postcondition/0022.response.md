Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string and must have at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [2, 0], [1, 1], or [0, 2] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `c` is the next element in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. If `c` is 1 and `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
