The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the element of the list `cnt` at the index `c` by 1. Given that `c` is the next element in the list `s` and `cnt` is initialized as `[0, 0]` with one of its elements incremented by 1, this operation will further increment either the first or the second element of `cnt` depending on the value of `c`.

Since `s` is a list of integers representing binary digits (0s and 1s), `c` can only be either 0 or 1. Therefore, if `c` is 0, the first element of `cnt` will be incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, the second element of `cnt` will be incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `s`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the newly input string and must have at least 1 element, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is `[0, 0]` with one of its elements incremented by 2 if `c` was the previously incremented element, or `[1, 1]` if `c` was the opposite element, `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**
