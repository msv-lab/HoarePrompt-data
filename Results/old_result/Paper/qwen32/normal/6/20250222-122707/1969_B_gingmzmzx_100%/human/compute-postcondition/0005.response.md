The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables `t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, or `cnt`. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `ans` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the original string, `n` must be greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0.**
