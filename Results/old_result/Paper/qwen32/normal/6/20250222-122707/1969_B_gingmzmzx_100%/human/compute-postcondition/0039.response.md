The code snippet provided increments the variable `ans` by 1 if the second element of the list `cnt` is greater than 0. 

Given the initial state, `cnt` can be one of three possible values: `[2, 0]`, `[0, 2]`, or `[1, 1]`. 

- If `cnt` is `[2, 0]`, `cnt[1]` is 0, so `ans` remains unchanged.
- If `cnt` is `[0, 2]`, `cnt[1]` is 2, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `cnt` is `[1, 1]`, `cnt[1]` is 1, so `ans` is incremented by 1.

The other variables (`t`, `s`, `n`, `zeroes`, and `c`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the binary digits of the input string and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than 1, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`, `cnt` is either [2, 0] if `c` was 0 or [0, 2] if `c` was 1 or [1, 1] if `c` was the opposite of the initial index with a value of 1, `c` is the next element in `s` after the previously processed element, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1] > 0`.**
