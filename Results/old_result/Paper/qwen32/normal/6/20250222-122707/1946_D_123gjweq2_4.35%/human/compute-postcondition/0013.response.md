Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `xor` is `i`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the second element of `cur_arr`.**

Explanation: The value of `xor` is updated to be the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value (which is 0) and `i`. Since `xor` was initially 0, `xor` now equals `i`. All other variables retain their initial values.
