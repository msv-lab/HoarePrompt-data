Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements; `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, and `bit` is not equal to -1; `i` is the third element of `cur_arr`; `thing1` is 0; if `xor` >> `bit` & 1` is 0, then `xor` is set to 0 and `new_arr` contains the value of `xor` appended to it; otherwise, `xor` remains `i`.**
