Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0. If the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` contains the value of the original `xor`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list.**
