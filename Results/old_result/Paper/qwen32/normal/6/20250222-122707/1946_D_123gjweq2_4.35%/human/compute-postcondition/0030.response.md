Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains values of `xor` where the `bit`-th bit was 0, `xor` is the final XOR value of elements in `cur_arr` that did not reset `xor` to 0. The `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`**
