To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to follow the logic of the loop and how it modifies the variables based on the input list `cur_arr` and the bit `bit`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the loop's behavior:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cur_arr`: List of non-negative integers.
   - `bit`: An integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not -1.
   - `new_arr`: An empty list.
   - `xor`: 0.
   - `thing1`: 0 (though `thing1` is not used in the loop, it remains unchanged).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each element `i` in `cur_arr`:
     - Compute `xor ^= i` (update `xor` by XORing it with `i`).
     - Check if the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0 (`if not xor >> bit & 1`):
       - If true, append the current `xor` value to `new_arr` and reset `xor` to 0.
       - If false, `xor` remains the updated value.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop completes, `cur_arr` remains unchanged.
   - `bit` remains unchanged.
   - `new_arr` contains the values of `xor` at points where the `bit`-th bit of `xor` was 0.
   - `xor` will be the final XOR value of all elements in `cur_arr` that did not trigger an append to `new_arr` due to the `bit`-th bit being 0.
   - `thing1` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.

Let's formalize this:

- **`cur_arr`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`bit`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`new_arr`**: Contains values of `xor` where the `bit`-th bit was 0.
- **`xor`**: The final XOR value of elements in `cur_arr` that did not reset `xor` to 0.
- **`thing1`**: Remains 0.

### Output State

Output State: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains values of `xor` where the `bit`-th bit was 0, `xor` is the final XOR value of elements in `cur_arr` that did not reset `xor` to 0, `thing1` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, the list `cur_arr` remains the same, the integer `bit` remains the same, `new_arr` will have stored the intermediate XOR values where the `bit`-th bit was 0, `xor` will hold the final XOR value of the elements in `cur_arr` that did not lead to resetting `xor` to 0, and `thing1` will remain unchanged as 0.
