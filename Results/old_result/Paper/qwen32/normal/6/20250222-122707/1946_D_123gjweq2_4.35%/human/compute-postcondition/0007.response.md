The code snippet provided is `xor ^= i`. This line performs an in-place XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the value of `i`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state provided, which means we cannot determine the exact new value of `xor` without knowing `i`. Given the constraints, we can only describe the operation and its effect on `xor` in terms of `i`.

Since the other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `thing1`) are not affected by this operation, we keep their descriptions as they are.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= `bit` < 30, `bit` is not equal to -1, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is `xor` ^ `i`, `thing1` is 0**.
