Functionality: **The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` such that 0 <= bit < 30. The function returns the length of `cur_arr` if `bit` is 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of a new list `new_arr`. If `bit` is greater than 0, it also returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` as `thing1`.**
