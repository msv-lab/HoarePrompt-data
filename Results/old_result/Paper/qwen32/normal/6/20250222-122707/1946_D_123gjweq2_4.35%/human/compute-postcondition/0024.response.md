Output State: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains values of `xor` where the `bit`-th bit was 0, `xor` is the final XOR value of elements in `cur_arr` that did not reset `xor` to 0, `thing1` is -1, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 1.**

Explanation: The only change in the output state is that the variable `thing1` is now assigned the value `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
