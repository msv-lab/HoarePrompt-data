Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is incremented by 1, but `i` is not used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for this particular print statement.
- `n`, `a`, `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

### Analysis:
- The expression `A * C / 2` computes the product of `A` and `C`, and then divides the result by 2.
- The `int()` function is used to convert the result of the division to an integer, effectively performing integer division.

### Output:
The output will be the integer result of the expression `A * C / 2`.

Since the exact values of `A` and `C` are not provided in the initial state, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `A` and `C`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are the integers read from the input)**
