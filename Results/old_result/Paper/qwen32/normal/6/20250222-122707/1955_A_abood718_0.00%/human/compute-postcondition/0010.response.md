To determine the output of the `print` statement, let's break down the given information and compute the values step-by-step.

### Given Information:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
3. The input value for the range is 1.
4. `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input.
5. `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`.
6. `A` is an odd integer.
7. `X` is `A // 2`.

### Calculation:
1. **Determine `X`:**
   - Since `A` is an odd integer, `A // 2` will be the integer division of `A` by 2, which effectively means it will be the largest integer less than or equal to `A / 2`.
   - For example, if `A` is 5, then `X = 5 // 2 = 2`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to be printed is `X * C + B`.
   - Substituting `X = A // 2`, the expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

### Output Description:
- The output will be the result of the expression `(A // 2) * C + B`.
- Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are not provided, we represent the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **(A // 2) * C + B (where A is an odd integer, B and C are integers such that B * 2 >= C)**
