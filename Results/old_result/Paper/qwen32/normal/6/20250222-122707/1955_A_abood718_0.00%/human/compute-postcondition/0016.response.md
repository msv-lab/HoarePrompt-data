To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable `t` does not directly affect the print statement.
- `i` is incremented by 1. This variable `i` does not directly affect the print statement.
- `n`, `a`, `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\). These variables `n`, `a`, and `b` do not directly affect the print statement.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are the three integers read from the input. These are the only variables directly involved in the print statement.

### Print Statement Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```
This statement calculates the value of \(A \times C / 2\) and then converts the result to an integer using the `int()` function.

### Calculation:
- The expression `A * C / 2` first multiplies `A` and `C`, and then divides the result by 2.
- The `int()` function then converts the result of this division into an integer, which means it will truncate any fractional part of the result.

### Output Description:
The output of the print statement will be the integer value of \(A \times C / 2\).

### Final Output:
Output: **int(A * C / 2) (where A and C are the integers read from the input)**
