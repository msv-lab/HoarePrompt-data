In the given initial state, we have the following variables and their constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `i` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not provided, and it's not directly used in the print statement.
- `n`, `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers read from the input.

The print statement is:
```python
print(A * B)
```

The output of this statement will be the product of the integers `A` and `B`. Since the exact values of `A` and `B` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are integers read from the input)**
