### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts, considering both the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. Let's break down the logic to see if it correctly handles all possible scenarios:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts on promotion).

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
   - **Case 1:** If the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price `C`, then it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually. Hence, the cost is `A * B`.
   - **Case 2:** If `A` (number of yogurts) is even, Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. The cost is `(A * C) / 2`.
   - **Case 3:** If `A` is odd, Maxim can buy `(A // 2)` pairs at the promotional price and one yogurt at the regular price. The cost is `(X * C) + B`, where `X` is the number of pairs (`A // 2`).

3. **Error in the Code:**
   - There is an issue in the third case where the program prints `X` (the number of pairs) before calculating the actual cost. This print statement is incorrect and should be removed.

4. **Corrected Logic:**
   - The corrected logic for the third case should be:
     ```python
     X = A // 2
     print(X * C + B)
     ```

5. **Verification with Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `2 5 9`
     - Since `5 * 2` (10) is greater than `9`, Maxim buys 1 pair at `9` burles. Output: `9`.
   - **Test Case 2:** `3 5 9`
     - Maxim buys 1 pair at `9` burles and 1 yogurt at `5` burles. Output: `14`.
   - **Test Case 3:** `3 5 11`
     - Maxim buys 1 pair at `11` burles and 1 yogurt at `5` burles. Output: `16` (not `15` as per the incorrect print statement).
   - **Test Case 4:** `4 5 11`
     - Maxim buys 2 pairs at `11` burles each. Output: `22` (not `20` as per the incorrect print statement).

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical error due to an incorrect print statement in the third case. Therefore, the program is not correct as it stands.

**Correctness:** **False**

The program needs to be corrected by removing the incorrect print statement in the third case.
