The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'Yes'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `t` is described as an integer between 1 and 10,000.
2. The variable `n` is described as a new input integer.
3. The variable `a` is described as a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer `n`.
4. The variable `b` is described as a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer from the latest input (which is the same as `n` in this context).

However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
