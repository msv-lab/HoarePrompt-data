The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`). Therefore, the output will be exactly the string `'No'`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is `print('No')`, which directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Thus, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **No**
