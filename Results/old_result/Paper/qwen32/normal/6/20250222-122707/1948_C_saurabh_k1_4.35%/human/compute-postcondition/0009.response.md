The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_` which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which is not a variable in the loop head but rather controls the number of iterations. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that controls the number of iterations.

Given that the loop will execute one more time, the input value must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings representing the digits of `n`; `b` is a list of strings representing the digits of the new input integer. If the second last element of `b` is the string `'<'`, then the condition of the if part is met; otherwise, the second-to-last element of `b` is not the string `'<'`. The input value for the number of iterations is decremented by 1.**
