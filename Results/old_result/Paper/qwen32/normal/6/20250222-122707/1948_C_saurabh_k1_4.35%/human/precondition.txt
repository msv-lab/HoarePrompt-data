t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even. The following two lines for each test case contain strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
