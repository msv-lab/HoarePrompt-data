The code snippet provided reassigns the values of `n` and `k` by splitting the string `s` and converting the resulting parts into integers. The initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten with these new values.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `s` is the next line of input starting from the second line, `n` is the first integer from the split of `s`, `k` is the second integer from the split of `s`.**
In natural language: The value of `t` remains unchanged, `s` remains the next line of input starting from the second line. `n` and `k` are now the first and second integers obtained by splitting `s`, respectively.
