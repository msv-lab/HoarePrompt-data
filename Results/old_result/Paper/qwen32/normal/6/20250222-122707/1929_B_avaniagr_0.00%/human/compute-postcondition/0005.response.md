To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given expression step by step based on the initial state provided:

### Initial State:
- `t` is at least 1 (but it's not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task).
- `s` is the next line of input starting from the second line.
- `n` is the first integer from the split of `s`.
- `k` is the second integer from the split of `s`.

### Expression to Evaluate:
```
(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Calculate `k // 2 + k % 2`:**
   - `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2.
   - `k % 2` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2.
   - The expression `k // 2 + k % 2` will always be equal to `k // 2 + 0` if `k` is even, and `k // 2 + 1` if `k` is odd.
   - Therefore, `k // 2 + k % 2` is equivalent to `ceil(k / 2)`, which is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

2. **Evaluate `k < 4 * n - 3`:**
   - This is a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` (1) if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`, and `False` (0) otherwise.

3. **Evaluate `k >= 4 * n - 3`:**
   - This is a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` (1) if `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3`, and `False` (0) otherwise.

4. **Evaluate `k == 4 * n - 2`:**
   - This is a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` (1) if `k` is exactly equal to `4 * n - 2`, and `False` (0) otherwise.

### Combining the Expressions:
- The expression can be broken down into three parts:
  - `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)` will be `ceil(k / 2)` if `k < 4 * n - 3`, and `0` otherwise.
  - `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)` will be `2 * n` if `k >= 4 * n - 3`, and `0` otherwise.
  - `(k == 4 * n - 2)` will be `1` if `k == 4 * n - 2`, and `0` otherwise.

### Final Output:
The final output will depend on the values of `k` and `n`. We can summarize the possible values:

- If `k < 4 * n - 3`, the output is `ceil(k / 2)`.
- If `k == 4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n + 1`.
- If `4 * n - 3 <= k < 4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n`.
- If `k >= 4 * n - 2` and `k != 4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n`.

### Output in Given Format:
Output: **(ceil(k / 2) if k < 4 * n - 3 else (2 * n + 1 if k == 4 * n - 2 else 2 * n)) (where k is the second integer from the split of `s` and n is the first integer from the split of `s`)**
