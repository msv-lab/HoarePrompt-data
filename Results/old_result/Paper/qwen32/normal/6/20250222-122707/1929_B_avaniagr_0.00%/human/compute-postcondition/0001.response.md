Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `s` is the first line of input starting from the second line, `n` is the first integer from the split of `s`, `k` is the second integer from the split of `s`.**

In simple terms, the variable `n` is assigned the first integer from the split of the string `s`, and `k` is assigned the second integer from the split of the string `s`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged.
