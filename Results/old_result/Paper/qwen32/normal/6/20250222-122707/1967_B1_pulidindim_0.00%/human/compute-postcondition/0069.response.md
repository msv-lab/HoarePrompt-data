The code snippet assigns the value of `n / count` to the variable `g`. Given the initial state, `n` is the first input integer and `count` is 2. Therefore, `g` will be equal to `n / 2`.

Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is the first input integer, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2`.**
