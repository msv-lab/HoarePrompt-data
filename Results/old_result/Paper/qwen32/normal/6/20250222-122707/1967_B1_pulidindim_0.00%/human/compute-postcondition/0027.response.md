Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is greater than 4, `count` is 4, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / count - countmins`, `ans` is `n + 2 * (g / count) + 2`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Natural language: The value of `g` has been decreased by `countmins`. All other variables remain unchanged. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
