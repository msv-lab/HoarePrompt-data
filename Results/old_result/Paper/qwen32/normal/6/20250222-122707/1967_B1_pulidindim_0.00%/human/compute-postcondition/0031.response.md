To determine the output of the `print(int(ans))` statement, we need to understand the computation involved in calculating the `ans` variable. The initial state provides us with the following information:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `count` is initialized to `m + 1`.
- `ans` is the final accumulated value after all iterations.

The problem states that `ans` is computed by summing up the contributions from each iteration of the loop. However, the loop itself is not provided in the initial state. To proceed, let's assume a typical loop structure that could lead to the accumulation of `ans`.

A common pattern in such problems is a loop that iterates from 0 to `m` (inclusive), and in each iteration, some value is added to `ans`. Since the exact loop is not given, we will consider a generic loop structure and derive the final value of `ans`.

Let's assume a generic loop that adds a value to `ans` in each iteration. For example, a loop that adds `i` to `ans` in each iteration would look like this:

```python
ans = 0
for i in range(m + 1):
    ans += i
```

In this case, `ans` would be the sum of the first `m` integers, which is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[ \text{ans} = \frac{m \times (m + 1)}{2} \]

However, since the exact loop is not provided, we will describe `ans` in a generic manner based on the given information.

Given the initial state and the typical pattern of such problems, `ans` is the accumulated value after iterating from 0 to `m` (inclusive) and adding some value in each iteration.

Therefore, the output of the `print(int(ans))` statement will be the final value of `ans` after all iterations.

Output: **ans (where ans is the final accumulated value after all iterations from 0 to m, inclusive)**

Since the exact loop and the value added in each iteration are not provided, we describe `ans` in the most precise manner possible based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is the final accumulated value after all iterations from 0 to m, inclusive)**
