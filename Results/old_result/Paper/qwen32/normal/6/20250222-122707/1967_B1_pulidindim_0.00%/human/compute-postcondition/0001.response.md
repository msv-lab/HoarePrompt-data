In the given task, the loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The variables `n` and `m` are mentioned in the problem statement but are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts does not affect the execution of the loop, as `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function in each iteration. However, to adhere to the format and ensure clarity, we can state that `i` is 0 before the loop starts, which is the value it will take in the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
