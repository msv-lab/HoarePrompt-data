Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 4, `ans` is `11n/18 + 2/3`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is `n / 4` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
