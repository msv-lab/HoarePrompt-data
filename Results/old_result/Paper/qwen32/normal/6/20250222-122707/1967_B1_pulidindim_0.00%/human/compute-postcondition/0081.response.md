Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is at least 3, `count` is 3, `ans` is the first input integer plus `(n / 2 - countmins) / count + 1`, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `n / 3 - 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated by subtracting `countmins` from it. All other variables remain unchanged.
