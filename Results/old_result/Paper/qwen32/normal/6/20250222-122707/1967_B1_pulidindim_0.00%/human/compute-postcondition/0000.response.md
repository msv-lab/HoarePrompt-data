Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value of the input, which is an integer within the specified range. The conditions and constraints for `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.
