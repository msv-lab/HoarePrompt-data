Let's carefully re-evaluate the provided code and the function summary to determine if the program is correct based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, we need to provide one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to solve the problem using a sliding window approach, which is not suitable for this problem. Let's break down the code and see why it fails:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        return print('YES')
    print('NO')
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

### Function Summary Recap
The function summary states that the function reads integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` from the input. It checks if it's possible to find at least `n` distinct sequences in `s` where each sequence contains all `k` unique lowercase English alphabets. If such sequences exist, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and then for each missing alphabet in the last sequence, it prints a constructed string that includes the found sequences, the missing alphabet, and additional 'a's to meet the required sequence length of `n`.

### Issues in the Code
1. **Incorrect Sliding Window Logic**: The code attempts to clear the `win` set after finding `k` unique characters, which does not correctly simulate the subsequence check.
2. **Incorrect Condition for "YES"**: The code checks if `ps >= n`, but this does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
3. **Incorrect Construction of the Missing Subsequence**: The code attempts to construct a missing subsequence but does not correctly identify one.

### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve:
1. **Generating All Possible Strings**: Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters.
2. **Checking Each String**: For each string, check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
3. **Identifying Missing Subsequence**: If any string is not found, output "NO" and provide that string.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with the sliding window logic and the incorrect conditions for "YES" and "NO", the provided code is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
