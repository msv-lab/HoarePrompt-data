Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers with specific constraints.
- `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least one element.
- `win` is an empty set or contains some characters from `s` but does not contain `i`.
- `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`.
- `ps` is a number of times `win` reached its size of `k`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
- The current character `i` is not in the set `win`.

### Code Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

Let's break down what each part of the print statement does:
1. `''.join(ans)`: This joins all the characters in the list `ans` into a single string. The list `ans` contains characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`.
2. `i`: This is the current character from the string `s` that is not in the set `win`.
3. `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`: This creates a string consisting of the character `'a'` repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. This ensures that the total length of the final printed string is `n`.

### Combining the Parts:
- The part `''.join(ans)` gives us the characters that have already been added to `win` to reach its size of `k`.
- The part `i` adds the current character from `s` that is not in `win`.
- The part `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` fills the remaining length of the string with `'a'`s to ensure the total length is `n`.

### Final Output:
The final printed string is a concatenation of the characters in `ans`, the current character `i`, and the required number of `'a'`s to make the length of the string `n`.

### Output:
Output: **[characters in ans] + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1) (where [characters in ans] are the characters that caused win to reach its size of k, i is the current character not in win, and 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1) fills the remaining length to n)**

For example, if `ans` is `['b', 'c']`, `i` is `'d'`, and `n` is `5`, the output would be:
Output: **bcdaa**
