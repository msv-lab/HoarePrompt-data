The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is the next character in the string `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current character being processed. To move to the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the sequence.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` if `i` is in `us`, and possibly other elements, with its length now being at most `k`; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `ps` is incremented by 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` remains unchanged; `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.

To be more specific, if `i` was the `j`-th character in `s` during the last iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the `(j+1)`-th character in `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` if `i` is in `us`, and possibly other elements, with its length now being at most `k`; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `ps` is incremented by 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` remains unchanged; `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.

To clarify, if `i` was `s[j]` in the last iteration, then in the current iteration, `i` should be `s[j+1]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` if `i` is in `us`, and possibly other elements, with its length now being at most `k`; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `ps` is incremented by 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` remains unchanged; `i` is the next character in the string `s`, i.e., `s[j+1]` where `j` is the index of `i` in the previous iteration**.

Since we do not know the exact index `j` of `i` in the previous iteration, we can simply state that `i` is the next character in the string `s`:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` if `i` is in `us`, and possibly other elements, with its length now being at most `k`; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `ps` is incremented by 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` remains unchanged; `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.
