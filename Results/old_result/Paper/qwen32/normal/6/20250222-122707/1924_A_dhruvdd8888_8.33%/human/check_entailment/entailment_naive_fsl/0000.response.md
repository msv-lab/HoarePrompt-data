Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not properly check for the presence of all possible subsequences.

Here is a specific counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2 5
ababa
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
aa
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the possible strings that can be formed are `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`. The string `aa` is not a subsequence of `ababa`, so the correct output should be `NO` followed by `aa`.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program may output `YES` for this input, which is incorrect.

The main issue with the program is the incorrect approach to checking for the presence of all possible subsequences. The program attempts to use a sliding window approach to clear the set `win` once it contains all `k` characters, but this does not guarantee that all possible subsequences are present in `s`.

A correct approach would involve generating all possible strings of length `n` and checking each one to see if it is a subsequence of `s`. This can be done using a more systematic method to ensure that all possible subsequences are considered.

Since the program does not correctly handle this case, it is incorrect.
