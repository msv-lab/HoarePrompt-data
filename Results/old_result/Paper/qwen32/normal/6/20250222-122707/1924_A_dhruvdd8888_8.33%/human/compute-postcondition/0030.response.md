To determine the final state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop processes the string `s` and modifies the variables `win`, `ans`, and `ps`.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
- If `i` is in the set `us` (which contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets), it is added to the set `win`.
- If the size of `win` reaches `k`, the character `i` is appended to the list `ans`, `ps` is incremented by 1, and `win` is cleared.

### Final Output State:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`k`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`s`**: Remains unchanged as it is only read from, not modified.
- **`us`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`win`**: Will be an empty set because the loop clears `win` every time its size reaches `k`.
- **`ans`**: Will contain all characters `i` from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`.
- **`ps`**: Will be the number of times `win` reached its size of `k` during the loop.

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variables `n`, `k`, and `m` remain the same as they are only used for constraints and are not modified within the loop.
- The string `s` remains unchanged as the loop only reads from it.
- The set `us` remains unchanged as it is initialized once and not modified.
- The set `win` will be empty at the end because it is cleared every time it reaches the size of `k`.
- The list `ans` will contain characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`.
- The variable `ps` will be the count of how many times `win` reached its size of `k`.

### Final Output State in Required Format:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`; `ps` is the number of times `win` reached its size of `k`.**
