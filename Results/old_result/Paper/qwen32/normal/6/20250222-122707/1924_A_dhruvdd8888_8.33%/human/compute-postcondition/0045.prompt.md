Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`; `ps` is a number of times `win` reached its size of `k`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least one element; `win` is an empty set or contains some characters from `s`, and if the current character `i` was not in `win`, it is now added to `win`; `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`; `ps` is a number of times `win` reached its size of `k`, and `ps` is less than `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least one element; `win` is an empty set or contains some characters from `s`, and if the current character `i` was not in `win`, it is now added to `win`; `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`; `ps` is a number of times `win` reached its size of `k`, and `ps` is less than `n`; `i` is the next element in the set `us` after the current `i`. If `i` was not in `win`, it is now added to `win`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must have at least one element; `win` is an empty set or contains some characters from `s`, and if the current character `i` was not in `win`, it is now added to `win`; `ans` is a list containing characters from `s` that caused `win` to reach its size of `k`; `ps` is a number of times `win` reached its size of `k`, and `ps` is less than `n`; `i` is the next element in the set `us` after the current `i`. If `i` was not in `win`, it is now added to `win`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
