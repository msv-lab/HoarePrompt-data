Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the element `i` if `i` is not already in `win`, and possibly other elements, with its length now being at most `k`; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `ps` is incremented by 1 if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ps` remains unchanged; `i` is the next character in the string `s`; `ans` now includes `i` as its last element; `ps` is now `ps + 1`.**

The variable `ps` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous states.
