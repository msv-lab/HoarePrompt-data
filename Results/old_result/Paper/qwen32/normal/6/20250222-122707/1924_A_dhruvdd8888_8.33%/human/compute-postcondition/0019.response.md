Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is an empty set; `ans` is a list containing the element `i` if the length of `win` became `k` after including `i`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing `i` and the previous elements of `ans`; `ps` is `ps + 1`; `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**

The set `win` is cleared, making it an empty set. All other variables retain their previous values.
