The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial state specifies the constraints and types of these variables, but their specific values are not given. After the execution of the code, the values of `n`, `k`, and `m` will be set according to the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 <= n <= 26, 1 <= k <= 26, and 1 <= m <= 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.**
