Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the first element of the list `res`.
- `res` must contain at least two elements.
- The variables `re`, `ul`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `k` remain unchanged and are not relevant to the print statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

This will print the value of `i` followed by a space, as the `end` parameter is set to a space character instead of the default newline.

Since `i` is explicitly defined as the first element of the list `res`, the output will be the value of that first element.

Output: **i (where i is the first element of the list `res`)**
