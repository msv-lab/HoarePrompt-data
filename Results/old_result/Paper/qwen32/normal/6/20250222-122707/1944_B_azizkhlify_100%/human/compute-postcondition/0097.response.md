The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n + 2`.

The condition for the loop to continue is `i < 2 * n`. Since `i` is now `n + 2`, the loop will continue as long as `n + 2 < 2 * n`, which simplifies to `n > 2`.

The state of `n` must remain such that the loop condition is satisfied, and since it was given that `n` must be less than `2 * n`, this condition is already satisfied as long as `n` is a positive integer.

The states `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` are not part of the loop head and therefore should not be adjusted here. However, for the loop to execute, `i` must be correctly set.

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 2**
