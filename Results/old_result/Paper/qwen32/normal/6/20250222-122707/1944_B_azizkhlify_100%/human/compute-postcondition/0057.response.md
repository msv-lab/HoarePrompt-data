Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `ul` is defined as the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2.
- `k` is a non-zero value.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- There is a condition involving `re` and `k`:
  - If `re` equals `k`, then `res` contains `a[0]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
  - If `re` does not equal `k`, the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output the value of `a[i]` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- From the initial state, we know that `i` is 1. Therefore, the value that will be printed is `a[1]`.

### Output:
Since `i` is 1, the value printed will be `a[1]`.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
