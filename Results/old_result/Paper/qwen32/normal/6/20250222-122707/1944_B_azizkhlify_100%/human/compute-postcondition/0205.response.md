Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step.

### Initial State:
- `res` is an empty list (though it is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is `i + 1` (This seems incorrect as it suggests `i` is being defined in terms of itself, but we will assume `i` is some integer value).
- `ul` and `ur` are equal (though they are not used in the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement prints `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
- `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to assume that `a` is a list or an array that has been defined elsewhere in the program.
- `i` is assumed to be a valid index for the list `a`.

### Output:
Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `a[i]`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a)**
