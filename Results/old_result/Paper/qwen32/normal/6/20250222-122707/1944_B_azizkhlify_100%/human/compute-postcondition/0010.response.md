The code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1.

Given the initial state, `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is incremented by 1. After executing the code, the value at `l[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by another 1. Therefore, `l[a[i] - 1]` will now be 2 if it was 1 before, or 1 if it was 0 before.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is incremented by 2 if it was 1 before, or 1 if it was 0 before; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is incremented by 1.**
