The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ur` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than 2, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.**
