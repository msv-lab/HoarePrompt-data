The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` should be `n + 1` and `n` remains the same for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is the input integer, `a` is the input list, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `r` is updated such that `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `re` is unchanged, `ul` and `ur` are unchanged, `i` is `n + 1`**
