Postcondition: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2; otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. The values of `ul` and `ur` are equal if the loop or if statement was broken out of.**
