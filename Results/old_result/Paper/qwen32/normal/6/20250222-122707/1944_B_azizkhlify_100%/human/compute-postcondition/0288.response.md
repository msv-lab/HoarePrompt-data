Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is determined based on the value of `k`:
   - If `k` is `0`, then `i` is `n-1`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is `n`.
2. `res` must contain at least one element, but its specific value is not relevant to the print statement.
3. `re`, `ul`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `k` remain unchanged, but their values are not specified, and they are not used in the print statement.

### Print Statement:
```
print(i, end=' ')
```
- The `print` function will output the value of `i`.
- The `end=' '` argument specifies that a space should be printed at the end of the output instead of the default newline character.

### Determining the Value of `i`:
- If `k` is `0`, `i` is `n-1`.
- If `k` is not `0`, `i` is `n`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we need to consider both possible scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: `k` is `0`, so `i` is `n-1`.
- **Scenario 2**: `k` is not `0`, so `i` is `n`.

### Final Output:
The output will depend on the value of `k`. However, we can provide a precise description based on the given conditions.

Output: **i (where i is n-1 if k is 0, otherwise i is n)**
