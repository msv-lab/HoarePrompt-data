Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, `ul` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `l[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 2 and `ul` remains unchanged. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change occurs to the control flow.**
