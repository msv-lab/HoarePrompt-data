Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input list, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, except if `l[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0, and if `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0. Additionally, if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0. `r` is updated such that `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` are incremented by 1, `re` is unchanged, `ul` is increased by 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was 2, otherwise `ul` is unchanged, and if `l[a[1] - 1]` was 2, `ul` is also increased by 2. `ur` is unchanged, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

In natural language: The values of the variables do not change except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions and states of the variables `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` remain as described in the initial state. The variable `i` remains 1.
