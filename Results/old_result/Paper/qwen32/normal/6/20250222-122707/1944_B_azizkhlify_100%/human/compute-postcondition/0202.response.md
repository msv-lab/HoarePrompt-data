Output State: **`res` is empty, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` and `ur` are equal if the loop or if statement was broken out of, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `res`, `n`, and the condition for `ul` and `ur` remain unchanged. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
