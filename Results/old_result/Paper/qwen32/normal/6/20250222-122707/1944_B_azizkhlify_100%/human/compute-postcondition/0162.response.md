Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0. If `re` equals `k`, `res` contains the elements from `a` such that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to the point where `re` became equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `re` is less than `k`, and `res` contains the elements from `a` such that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to but not including the point where `re` would have become equal to `k`.**
