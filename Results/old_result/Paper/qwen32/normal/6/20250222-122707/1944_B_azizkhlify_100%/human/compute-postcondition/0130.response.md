Let's break down the given information and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `i` is 0.
3. The current value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and the `end` parameter is set to a space, meaning the output will not end with a newline but with a space.

- From the initial state, we know `i` is 0. Therefore, the statement is effectively printing `a[0]` twice.

- However, the initial state does not provide the explicit value of `a[0]`. It only tells us something about `l[a[i] - 1]`, which is `l[a[0] - 1]` and that this value is 2.

### Conclusion:
Since we don't have the explicit value of `a[0]`, the best we can do is describe the output in terms of `a[0]`.

Output: **a[0] a[0] (where a[0] is the first element of the list a)**
