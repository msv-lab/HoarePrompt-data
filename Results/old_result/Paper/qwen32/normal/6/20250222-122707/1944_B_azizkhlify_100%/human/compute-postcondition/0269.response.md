Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `l[a[i] - 1]` either equals 1 or does not equal 1. If `re` equals `k`, the current value of `re` equals `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `re` does not equal `k` and the program continues as per the else part which is not specified but does not alter the given conditions on `i`, `n`, and `l[a[i] - 1]`.**
