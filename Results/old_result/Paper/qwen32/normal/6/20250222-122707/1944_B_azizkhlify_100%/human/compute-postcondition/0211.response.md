To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the conditions and changes within the loop. The loop iterates from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`. The loop will break if `ul` equals `ur` at any point, otherwise, it will continue until the end of the range.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: `res` is empty, `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, the loop checks if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
   - If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, it prints `a[i]` twice, sets `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0, and increments `ur` by 2.
   - If `ul` equals `ur` at any point, the loop breaks.
3. **Final State**:
   - The loop will iterate until `i` reaches `2 * n - 1` unless it breaks due to `ul` equaling `ur`.
   - `res` remains empty as no changes are made to it within the loop.
   - `ul` and `ur` will be equal if the loop breaks, otherwise, `ur` will have been incremented by 2 for each occurrence of `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.

Given the provided output states for the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop will continue until it either breaks or completes all iterations. The final state will depend on whether `ul` equals `ur` at any point during the loop.

Given the conditions, the final state can be described as follows:

- `res` remains empty.
- `i` will be `2 * n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- `ul` and `ur` will be equal if the loop breaks, otherwise, `ur` will be incremented by 2 for each occurrence of `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` will be set to 0 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.

Output State: **`res` is empty, `i` is `2 * n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `ul` and `ur` are equal if the loop breaks, otherwise, `ur` is incremented by 2 for each occurrence of `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.**
