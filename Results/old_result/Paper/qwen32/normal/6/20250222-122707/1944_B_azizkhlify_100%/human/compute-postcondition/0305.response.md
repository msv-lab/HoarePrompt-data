Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is defined as the last element of the list `res` plus 1.
2. `n` is a non-negative integer.
3. The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

### Analysis:
- We need to determine the value of `a[i]` where `i = res[-1] + 1`. 
- However, the list `res` and the list `a` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. 
- Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of the variables and their relationships.

### Steps:
1. Identify `res[-1]`: This is the last element of the list `res`.
2. Calculate `i`: `i = res[-1] + 1`.
3. Determine `a[i]`: This is the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

### Output Description:
The print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, where `i` is the last element of the list `res` plus 1. Since the lists `res` and `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i], a[i] (where i = res[-1] + 1 and a[i] is the element at index i in the list a)**
