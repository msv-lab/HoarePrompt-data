The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `res` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet as they are not mentioned in the provided code. The variables `ul` and `ur` are also not mentioned in the provided code snippet and are only relevant during the loop execution, which is not shown in the code snippet provided. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `n` and `k` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `res` is empty, and `i` is `2 * n` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. If the loop breaks, `ul` and `ur` are equal. During the loop, `ur` is incremented by 2 for each occurrence of `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `i` where `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.**
