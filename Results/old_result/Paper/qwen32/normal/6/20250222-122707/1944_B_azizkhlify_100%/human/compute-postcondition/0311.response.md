The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `2 * n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `res` plus 1, and `n` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the last element of `res` plus 2, and `n` will still be the same non-negative integer.

State: **`i` is the last element of `res` plus 2, `n` is a non-negative integer**
