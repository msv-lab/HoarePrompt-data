Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue until all elements in `res` have been processed. `ul` will remain the same since it is calculated based on the initial conditions and does not change within the loop. `ul` is not equal to `ur`. `i` will be the last element processed in `res`. `re` will be the count of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 1, which is consistent with the initial conditions. `res` will be fully processed, meaning all elements will have been printed. `k` will be updated to `2 * k - ul`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be less than `2 * n`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is `2`, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` is `0` and `ur` is increased by 2. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop is terminated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than 2, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `ul` equals `ur`, the condition `ul == ur` holds.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
