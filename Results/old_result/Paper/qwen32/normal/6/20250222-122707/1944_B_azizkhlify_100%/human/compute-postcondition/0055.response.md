Postcondition: **`ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, multiplied by 2; `k` is a non-zero value; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; if `re` is equal to `k`, then `res` contains `a[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `re` is not equal to `k` and the program continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.**
