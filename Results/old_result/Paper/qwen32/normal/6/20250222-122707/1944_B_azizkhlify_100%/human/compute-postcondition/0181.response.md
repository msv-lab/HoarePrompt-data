To determine the output of the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i` is `n-1`**: This means `i` holds the value of `n-1`.
2. **`ul` is the total number of times `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2 multiplied by 2**: This means `ul` is a value that was calculated based on how many times a certain condition (`l[a[i] - 1]` being 2) occurred, and then that count was multiplied by 2.
3. **`l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 for each `i` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2**: This implies that after some operation (presumably the calculation of `ul`), the elements in `l` that were 2 are now set to 0.
4. **`k` is `2 * k - ul`**: This is a calculation involving `k` and `ul`, but it's not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
5. **`res` must contain at least one element**: This indicates that the list `res` has at least one element, but the specific element(s) are not relevant to the `print` statement.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement only involves the variable `i`.
- According to the initial state, `i` is `n-1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `i`, which is `n-1`.

Output: **n-1**
