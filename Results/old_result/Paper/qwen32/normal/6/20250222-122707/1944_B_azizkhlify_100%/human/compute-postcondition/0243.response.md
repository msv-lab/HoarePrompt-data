Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input list, `l` is a list where `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, except if `l[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` was 2, it is now 0, `r` is updated such that `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` are incremented by 1, `re` is unchanged, `ul` and `ur` are unchanged, `i` is `2 * n - 1`. If `l[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` was 2, `ul` is increased by 2. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the loop or if statement is broken out of.**
