The code snippet reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state of `t` and `test` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are integers provided by the input**.
