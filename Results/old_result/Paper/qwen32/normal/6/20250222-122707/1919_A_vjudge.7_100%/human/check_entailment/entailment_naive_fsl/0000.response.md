To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap their wallets or keep them and then remove one coin from their current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a move, and the other player wins. Both players play optimally.

### Key Observations
1. **Optimal Play**: Since both players play optimally, they will always make the move that maximizes their chances of winning.
2. **Game State**: The game state can be represented by the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who can force the other player into a position where they cannot make a move wins.

### Strategy
The strategy revolves around the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins (`a + b`):
- If `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
- If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.

### Explanation
The reasoning behind this strategy is based on the fact that each move reduces the total number of coins by 1. Therefore, the parity of the total number of coins alternates between even and odd with each move. If the total number of coins is even initially, Bob can always force Alice into a position where she faces an even number of coins on her turn, eventually leading to Bob's win. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd initially, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he faces an odd number of coins on his turn, eventually leading to Alice's win.

### Code Analysis
The provided code correctly implements the above strategy:
```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```
The code reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks the parity of the sum of the coins and prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

### Verification
Let's verify the code with the provided examples:
1. **Example 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 1`
   - `a + b = 2` (even) → Bob wins.
2. **Example 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`
   - `a + b = 5` (odd) → Alice wins.
3. **Example 3**: `a = 5`, `b = 3`
   - `a + b = 8` (even) → Bob wins.
4. **Example 4**: `a = 4`, `b = 5`
   - `a + b = 9` (odd) → Alice wins.
5. **Example 5**: `a = 11`, `b = 9`
   - `a + b = 20` (even) → Bob wins.
6. **Example 6**: `a = 83`, `b = 91`
   - `a + b = 174` (even) → Bob wins.
7. **Example 7**: `a = 1032`, `b = 9307`
   - `a + b = 10339` (odd) → Alice wins.
8. **Example 8**: `a = 839204`, `b = 7281`
   - `a + b = 846485` (odd) → Alice wins.
9. **Example 9**: `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`
   - `a + b = 2000000000` (even) → Bob wins.
10. **Example 10**: `a = 53110`, `b = 2024`
    - `a + b = 55134` (even) → Bob wins.

All the examples match the expected output, indicating that the code is correct for these cases.
