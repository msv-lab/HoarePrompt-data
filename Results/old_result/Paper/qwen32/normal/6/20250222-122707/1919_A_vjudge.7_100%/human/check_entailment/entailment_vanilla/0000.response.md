To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the strategy and the logic behind the game.

### Key Insight:
The game revolves around the total number of coins (a + b). The player who starts the game (Alice) can always force a win if the total number of coins is odd, and Bob can always force a win if the total number of coins is even. This is because:

- **Even Total Coins (a + b is even):** If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always face a situation where Bob can mirror her moves. For example, if Alice swaps, Bob can swap back, and if Alice removes a coin from her wallet, Bob can do the same to his wallet, ensuring that Bob always has a move until Alice is left with no coins.
  
- **Odd Total Coins (a + b is odd):** If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can ensure she always leaves Bob with an even number of coins after her move. Since Bob will always face an even number of coins, he will eventually be left with no coins, making Alice the winner.

### Program Analysis:
The program correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the total number of coins (a + b):

- If `a + b` is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), it prints "Bob", indicating that Bob wins.
- If `a + b` is odd (`a + b & 1 != 0`), it prints "Alice", indicating that Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy described above. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
