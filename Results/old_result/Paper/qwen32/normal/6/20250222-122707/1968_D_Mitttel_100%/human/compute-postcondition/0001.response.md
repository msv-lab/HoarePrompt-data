The variable `mx` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is a list of 4 integers [t, n, P_B, P_S] where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), P_B and P_S are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), and k is the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0.**
