To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop continues until either `vis[s]` is `True` (indicating that the position `s` has been visited before) or `k` becomes `0` (indicating that the number of turns has exhausted).

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following pattern:
1. The loop updates the `vis` list to mark positions as visited.
2. The `mx` variable keeps track of the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]`.
3. The `cur` variable accumulates the values of `a[s]` as the loop progresses.
4. The `s` variable is updated to the next position in the permutation `p`.
5. The `k` variable decrements by 1 in each iteration.

The loop will terminate when either:
- `vis[s]` is `True`, meaning the same position is revisited, indicating a cycle.
- `k` is `0`, meaning the number of turns has been exhausted.

To determine the final state, we need to consider these two termination conditions. However, based on the given information, we don't have specific values for `a`, `p`, `P_S`, and `k`, so we can describe the state in a general form.

Hereâ€™s the final state in a general form:

- `vis` will have `1`s at all positions that were visited during the loop, starting from `P_S - 1`.
- `mx` will hold the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop.
- `cur` will be the sum of all `a[s]` values that were accumulated during the loop.
- `s` will be the last position visited before the loop terminates.
- `k` will be `0` if the loop terminated due to the number of turns exhausting, or it will be the remaining number of turns if the loop terminated due to revisiting a position.

Given the pattern and the constraints, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`vis` is a list of n integers where positions corresponding to the visited indices are 1, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` values accumulated, `s` is the last visited position, and `k` is 0 if all turns were used or the remaining turns if a cycle was detected.**

In simpler terms:
- `vis` will have `1`s at all visited positions.
- `mx` will be the highest value of `cur + k * a[s]` seen.
- `cur` will be the total sum of `a[s]` values visited.
- `s` will be the last position before termination.
- `k` will be `0` if all turns were used, or the remaining turns if a cycle was detected.
