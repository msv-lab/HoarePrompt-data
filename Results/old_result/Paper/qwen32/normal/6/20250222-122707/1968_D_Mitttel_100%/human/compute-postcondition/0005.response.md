The code snippet `vis[s] = 1` sets the value at the index `s` in the list `vis` to 1. Given that `s` is a list of 4 integers `[t, n, P_B, P_S]`, this operation will result in an error because `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, and `s` is not a valid index for `vis`. However, if we assume that the intention is to use one of the elements of `s` as the index (most likely `P_B` or `P_S`), we will proceed with the assumption that `s[2]` (P_B) or `s[3]` (P_S) is used as the index.

Let's assume `P_B` (i.e., `s[2]`) is the intended index. Therefore, `vis[P_B - 1] = 1` because list indices in Python are 0-based.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `p` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n) representing a permutation, `s` is a list of 4 integers [t, n, P_B, P_S] where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), P_B and P_S are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), and k is the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of n zeros except at index `P_B - 1` where it is 1. `k` must be greater than 0.**

If `P_S` (i.e., `s[3]`) is the intended index, then `vis[P_S - 1] = 1`.

Since the problem statement does not specify which element of `s` should be used as the index, both interpretations are valid. However, for the sake of providing a single output state, we will assume `P_B` is the intended index.
