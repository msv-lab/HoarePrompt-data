Postcondition: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - i \times (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\). If \((a - i \times (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \times (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\), then `suma` has been incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.**
