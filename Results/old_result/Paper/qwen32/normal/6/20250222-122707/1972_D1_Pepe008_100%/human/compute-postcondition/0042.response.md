The code snippet provided increments the value of `suma` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `suma` after the increment is `2 * x + 1`.

Output State: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `2 * x + 1`.**
