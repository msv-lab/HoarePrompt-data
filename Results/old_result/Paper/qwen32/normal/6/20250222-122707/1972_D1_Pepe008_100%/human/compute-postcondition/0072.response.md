To determine the output state, we need to calculate the new value of `x` based on the given formula and the initial conditions:

Given:
- `info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input.
- `b` is at least 1.
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is initially `a + 1`.

The code snippet is:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

Let's calculate the new value of `x` step-by-step:
1. Calculate `i * (i - 1)`: Since `i` is 2, `i * (i - 1) = 2 * (2 - 1) = 2`.
2. Calculate `i ** 2`: Since `i` is 2, `i ** 2 = 2 ** 2 = 4`.
3. Calculate `a - i * (i - 1)`: This is `a - 2`.
4. Calculate `(a - 2) // 4`: This is the integer division of `a - 2` by 4.
5. Finally, add 1 to the result of the previous step to get the new value of `x`.

The new value of `x` is therefore `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.**

In natural language: The value of `x` has been updated to `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
