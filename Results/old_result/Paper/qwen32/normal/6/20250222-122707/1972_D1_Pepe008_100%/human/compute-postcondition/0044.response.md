Postcondition: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `b`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is considered. Otherwise, there is no specific change to the variables related to the else part.**
