Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` must be greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `x` is calculated based on the given formula, and all other variables retain their initial values.
