The provided code snippet sets `suma` to 0. This affects the value of `suma` but does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input; `t` is `b + 3`; `T` is greater than 0; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`; `i` is `b + 1`; `suma` is 0.**
