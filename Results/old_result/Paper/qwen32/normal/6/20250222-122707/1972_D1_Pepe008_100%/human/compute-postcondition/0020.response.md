The code calculates the value of `x` based on the given formula and updates the value of `x` accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged except for `i` which has already been incremented by 2 in the initial state.

The formula for `x` is:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `T` is greater than 0
- `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is `i + 2`

After the execution of the code, the new value of `x` is calculated and `i` remains incremented by 2.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**
