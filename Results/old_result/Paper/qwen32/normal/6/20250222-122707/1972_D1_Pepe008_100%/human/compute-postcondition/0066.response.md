The code snippet updates the value of `x` based on the new formula provided. Here's the calculation:

- The initial state specifies that `x` was calculated as \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 1\).
- The new formula for `x` is `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
- Given `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `x = (a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1 ** 2 + 1`, which further simplifies to `x = (a - 0) // 1 + 1` or `x = a + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `x` is `a + 1`.

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a + 1`.**
