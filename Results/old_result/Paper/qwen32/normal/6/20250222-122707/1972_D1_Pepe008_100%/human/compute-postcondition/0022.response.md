Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is increased by `x` and then increased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `suma` has been increased by 1 after the code was executed. All other variables retain their previous values or expressions.
