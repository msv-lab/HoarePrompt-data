Reasoning:
The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, the program's logic does not correctly implement the solution to this problem. 

The program iterates over possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` for each test case and calculates a value `x` based on a formula that does not directly relate to the problem's requirements. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent conditions do not accurately check whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The program also subtracts 2 from the final sum, which does not logically follow from the problem's requirements.

A correct approach would involve iterating over all pairs (a, b) within the given ranges, calculating `gcd(a, b)`, and checking if `a + b` is divisible by `b * gcd(a, b)`. This approach would be computationally expensive for large `n` and `m`, but it would correctly solve the problem.

Given the execution summary and the program's logic, it is evident that the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
