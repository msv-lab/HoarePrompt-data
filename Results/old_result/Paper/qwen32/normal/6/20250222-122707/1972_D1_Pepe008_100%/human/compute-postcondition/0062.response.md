The code increments the value of `suma` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is `b + 1`, `suma` is \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 2\), `x` is \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 1\)**.

In natural language, the output state means that the list `info` and the values of `b`, `T`, `a`, `i`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `suma` is increased by 1, making it \(\left(\frac{a - b^2 - b}{b^2 + 2b + 1}\right) + 2\).
