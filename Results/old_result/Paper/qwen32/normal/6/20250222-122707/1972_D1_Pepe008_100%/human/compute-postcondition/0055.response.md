The code snippet assigns the integer value of the first element in the list `info` to `a` and the integer value of the second element in the list `info` to `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are updated to these new values. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input; `t` is `b + 3`; `T` is greater than 0; `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`; `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`; `i` is `b + 1`; `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated in each iteration where `x > 0`.**
