The code snippet provided modifies the value of `suma` by adding `x` to it. The values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is calculated based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i` and is then added to `suma`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is greater than 0, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i + 2`, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is increased by `x`.**
