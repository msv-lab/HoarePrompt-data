Postcondition: **`info` is a list of substrings, `t` is `b + 2`, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is `b + 1`, and `suma` is `x`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is true, then `suma` is updated to `x + 1`. Otherwise, `suma` remains `x`.**
