Postcondition: **`info` is a new list of substrings based on the user's input, `b` is at least 1, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a + 1`. If `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0`, then `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i` is evaluated. Otherwise, no further action is taken.**

This postcondition captures the state of the variables after the if-else block, considering both the condition being true and false.
