The code snippet `cd += 1` increments the value of `cd` by 1. The initial state does not specify the initial value of `cd`, so we will denote the new value of `cd` as `cd + 1`.

The variables `N`, `nums`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. `N` remains the first input integer, `nums` remains a sorted list of integers with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and `i` remains 2.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `cd` is `cd + 1`**.
