Postcondition: **`N` is assigned the value of the first input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of integers derived from the original set with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning and the length of `nums` is greater than 3. If `nums[i + 1] - nums[i]` equals 1, `cd` is 1; otherwise, `cd` is 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
