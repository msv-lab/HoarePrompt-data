Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the number of piles, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the number of stones in each pile. The function does not return a value (returns None). Instead, it prints 'Alice' to the console if a certain condition is met, otherwise, it prints 'Bob'. The specific conditions for printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' are not detailed in the provided information.**
