Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is either an empty list (if `arr[i] < 0` and the if condition is true), a list where the first element is updated to its original value plus `arr[i]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is true), or a list containing `[arr[i + 1], i + 1]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is false); `i` is `i + 2` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise `i` is `i + 1`; `segments_variants` includes an additional list which is `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise it contains the previous elements of `segments_variants` plus a new element which is `new_segment` concatenated with `[i - 1]`; `max_segment` is `max_segment` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise it is `new_segment`.**
