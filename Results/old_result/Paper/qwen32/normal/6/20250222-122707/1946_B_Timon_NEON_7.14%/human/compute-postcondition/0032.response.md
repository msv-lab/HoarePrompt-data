The code snippet adds the value of `arr[i]` to the first element of the `max_segment` list. Given that `i` is `i + 1`, we assume `i` has already been incremented before this line of code is executed. The values of `arr` and `new_segment` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list; `i` is `i + 1`; `max_segment[0]` is the original `max_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`.**
