Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a non-empty list. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment` is reset to `[]`, `segments_variants` contains either `[0, 0, i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` if `new_segment[0]` is greater than or equal to `max_segment[0]`. In this case, `max_segment[0]` is also updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is not less than 0, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `max_segment` is updated to `[max_segment[0] + arr[i], 0]`, and `segments_variants` remains an empty list. `max_sum` is -1 in both cases.**
