To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(len(arr)):`. The only variable that can be adjusted is `i`, and the length of `arr` is what determines if the loop will execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the controlling factor**: The loop will execute if `len(arr)` is greater than 0. If `arr` is an empty list, the loop will not execute.
2. **Adjustments needed**: To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one element. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted because `i` is initialized by the `range` function at the start of each iteration.

Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `arr` has at least one integer.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [0, 0]; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1**.
