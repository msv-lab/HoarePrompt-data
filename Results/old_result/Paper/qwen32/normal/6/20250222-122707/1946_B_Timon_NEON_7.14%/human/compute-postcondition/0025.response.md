The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that the loop iterates over the indices of `arr` using `range(len(arr))`, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration should be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list. The value of `i` is the index that was just processed.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

Thus, if `i` was 0 in the previous iteration, it should be 1 at the start of the next iteration. If `i` was 1, it should be 2, and so on.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list; `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since the specific value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not provided, we represent the next state with `i` being incremented by 1.
