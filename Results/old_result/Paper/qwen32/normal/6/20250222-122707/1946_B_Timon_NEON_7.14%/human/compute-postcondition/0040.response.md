The code snippet provided appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is constructed by concatenating `max_segment` with a list containing `i - 1`. The values of `arr`, `new_segment`, and `i` remain unchanged as per the given code snippet, except for `i` which is incremented by 1 in the initial state description.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is either an empty list (if `arr[i] < 0` and the if condition is true), a list where the first element is updated to its original value plus `arr[i]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is true), or a list containing `[arr[i + 1], i + 1]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is false); `i` is `i + 2`; `segments_variants` includes an additional list which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`.**
