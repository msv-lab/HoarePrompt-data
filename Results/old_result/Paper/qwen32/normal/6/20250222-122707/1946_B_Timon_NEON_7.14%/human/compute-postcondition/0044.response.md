The code snippet provided sets `new_segment` to an empty list. This change impacts the variable `new_segment` directly, while the other variables (`arr`, `i`, `segments_variants`, and `max_segment`) remain unaffected by this single line of code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is an empty list; `i` is `i + 2` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise `i` is `i + 1`; `segments_variants` includes an additional list which is `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise it contains the previous elements of `segments_variants` plus a new element which is `new_segment` concatenated with `[i - 1]`; `max_segment` is `max_segment` if `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, otherwise it is `new_segment`.**
