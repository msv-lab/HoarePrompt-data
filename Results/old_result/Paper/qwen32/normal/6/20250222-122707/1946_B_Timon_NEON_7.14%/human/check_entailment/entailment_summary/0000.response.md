### Reasoning:

To determine if the provided program is correct, we need to check whether it adheres to the problem description and correctly computes the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

1. **Function `func_1`:** This function is correctly implemented to return the remainder of a number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure that the final answer is within the required modulo range.

2. **Function `func_2`:** This function is intended to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the given array. It iterates through the array, maintaining a running sum (`max_segment[0]`) and updating it whenever a new subarray with a higher sum is found. If all elements are negative, it returns `[-1]`. This function is crucial for identifying the segment that, when duplicated and inserted, will maximize the overall sum of the array.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program involves reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, reading the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a` itself.
   - It then calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum segment.
   - If the maximum segment sum is negative (all elements are negative), it is set to 0.
   - The formula used to calculate the final answer is `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`. This formula is based on the idea that by inserting the maximum sum segment repeatedly, the total sum can be maximized. The term `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k` represents the cumulative sum of the maximum segment after k operations, and `sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is the sum of the original array excluding the maximum segment (since the maximum segment will be added back multiple times).
   - The result is then passed through `func_1` to take modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Function `func_3`:** This function is not used in the main logic and does not affect the correctness of the program. It can be ignored.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly identifies the maximum sum segment and calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations using the derived formula. It also ensures that the final answer is within the required modulo range. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
