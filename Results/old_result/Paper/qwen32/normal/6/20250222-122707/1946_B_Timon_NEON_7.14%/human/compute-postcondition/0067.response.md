To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the provided states.

The loop iterates over each segment in `segments_variants`. For each segment, it checks if the sum of the current `total_max_segment` is less than the sum of the current segment. If so, it updates `total_max_segment` to the current segment.

Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
1. After the first iteration, `total_max_segment` is set to the first segment in `segments_variants` if its sum is greater than the initial `total_max_segment` sum of -1.
2. After the second iteration, `total_max_segment` is updated if the second segment in `segments_variants` has a greater sum than the current `total_max_segment`.
3. After the third iteration, `total_max_segment` is updated if the third segment in `segments_variants` has a greater sum than the current `total_max_segment`.

Since `segments_variants` contains at least two segments (`max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`), and the loop iterates over all segments in `segments_variants`, the final value of `total_max_segment` will be the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.

Considering the loop iterates over all segments in `segments_variants`, the final `total_max_segment` will be the segment with the highest sum. Since `max_segment` is defined as the segment with the maximum sum and its last index, it is likely that `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` will be the segment with the maximum sum, unless `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` has a higher sum.

Thus, the final state of `total_max_segment` will be the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.

Output State: **`arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains all the segments encountered and now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, `total_max_segment` will hold the segment with the highest sum from `segments_variants`, while other variables remain unchanged or reflect their definitions as per the initial state and the loop's logic.
