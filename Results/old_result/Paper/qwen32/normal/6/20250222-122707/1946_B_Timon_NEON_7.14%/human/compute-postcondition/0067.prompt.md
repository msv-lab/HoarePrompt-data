Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains all the segments encountered and now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.
Code of the loop:
for segment in segments_variants:
    if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
        total_max_segment = segment


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains at least one segment (either `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` or `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`); `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment` if `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]`, otherwise it remains `[-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains at least two segments (either `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`); `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment` if `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `segment` is `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains at least one segment (specifically, `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`); `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment` if `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `segment` is `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
