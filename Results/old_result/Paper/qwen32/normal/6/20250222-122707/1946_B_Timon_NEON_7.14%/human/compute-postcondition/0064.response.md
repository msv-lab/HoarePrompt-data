The only object in the loop head is the variable `segment`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `segments_variants` list. If there are more segments in `segments_variants`, the loop will execute again with the next segment.

At the end of the last iteration, `segments_variants` contains at least two segments. After the previous iteration, `segment` was set to the last segment in `segments_variants`, which is `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `segments_variants` must still have at least one more segment to process, and `segment` should be set to that next segment.

Since `segments_variants` contains at least two segments, we can assume that after the first iteration, there is still at least one segment left. The next segment to be processed should be the first segment in `segments_variants`, which is `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `segment` should be set to `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.

State: **`arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains at least one segment (specifically, `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`); `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is now equal to `segment` if `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `segment` is `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`**
