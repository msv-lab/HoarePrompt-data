Output State: **The program returns `total_max_segment`, which is either `[-1]` indicating the maximum segment length is 1, or the segment with the maximum sum among all segments in `segments_variants`.**

In simpler terms, the program returns a segment that either has a maximum length of 1 (indicated by `[-1]`) or the segment with the highest sum from all the segments stored in `segments_variants`.
