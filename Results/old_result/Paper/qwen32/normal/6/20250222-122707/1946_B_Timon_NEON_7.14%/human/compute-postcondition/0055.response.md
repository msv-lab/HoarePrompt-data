The code appends the concatenation of `new_segment` and `[len(arr) - 1]` to `segments_variants`. Given that `segments_variants` already includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` before this operation, this new append operation adds an additional segment to `segments_variants`.

The other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `max_sum`) remain unchanged. `arr` remains the same, `new_segment` retains its value (either empty or containing the last segment of non-negative integers), `max_segment` keeps its value (the segment with the maximum sum and its last index), and `max_sum` remains -1.

Output State: **`arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains all the segments encountered and now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` remains -1.**
