Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is either an empty list (if `arr[i] < 0`) or a list where the first element is updated to its original value plus `arr[i]` (otherwise); `i` is `i + 1`; `max_segment[0]` is the original `max_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`.**
