Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list containing the current element `arr[i]` and its index `i`; `max_segment` is [0, 0]; `segments_variants` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1; the current element `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In simple terms: The `new_segment` list now contains the current element `arr[i]` and its index `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
