Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly k operations. Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after k such operations, and the result should be provided modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis

#### Function 1: `func_1`
```python
def func_1(number):
    return number % 1000000007
```
- This function correctly computes the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) of a given number. It is used to ensure the result remains within the required range.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
```python
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
            total_max_segment = segment
    if len(total_max_segment) == 1:
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    return total_max_segment
```
- This function attempts to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum using a modified version of Kadane's algorithm. It keeps track of segments and their sums.
- However, the implementation has several issues:
  - The `max_segment` and `new_segment` are not correctly initialized and updated.
  - The logic for handling negative numbers and resetting segments is flawed.
  - The final segment is not correctly handled, leading to incorrect results.
  
#### Function 3: `func_3`
```python
def func_3(number, quantity):
    answer = 0
```
- This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations but is currently a no-op.

### Correctness
Given the issues in `func_2` and the incomplete `func_3`, the program is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. The logic for finding the maximum subarray sum and using it to perform k operations is not correctly implemented.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
