The code snippet provided sets `new_segment` to an empty list. The other variables (`arr`, `segments_variants`, `max_segment`, `i`) are not directly modified by this line, so their states remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is an empty list; `i` is `i + 1`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` has a new appended element which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `new_segment + [i]` and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.**
