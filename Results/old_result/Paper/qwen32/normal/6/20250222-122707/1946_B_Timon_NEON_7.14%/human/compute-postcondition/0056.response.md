Output State: **`arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains all the segments encountered and now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` and `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`; `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.**

In this output state, the only change is that a new variable `total_max_segment` is introduced and assigned the value `[-1]`. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
