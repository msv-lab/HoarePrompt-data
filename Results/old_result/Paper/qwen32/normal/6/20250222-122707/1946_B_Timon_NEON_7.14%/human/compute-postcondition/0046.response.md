Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is either an empty list (if `arr[i] < 0` and the if condition is true), a list where the first element is updated to its original value plus `arr[i]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is true), or a list containing `[arr[i + 1], i + 1]` (if `arr[i] >= 0` and the if condition is false); `i` is `i + 1`; `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**

In simpler terms: The value of `max_segment[0]` is now its original value plus `arr[i]`. The values of `arr`, `new_segment`, and `i` remain as described in the initial state, with `i` having been incremented by 1.
