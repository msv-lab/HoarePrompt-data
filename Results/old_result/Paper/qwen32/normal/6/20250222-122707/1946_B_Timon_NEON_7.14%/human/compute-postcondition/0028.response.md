The code assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a list; `i` is `i + 1`; `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `new_segment + [i]`; `max_segment` is `new_segment`.
