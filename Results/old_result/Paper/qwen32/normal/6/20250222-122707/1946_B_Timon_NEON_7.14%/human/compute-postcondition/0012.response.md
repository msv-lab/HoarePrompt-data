Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a non-empty list; `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1; the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.***
