The code appends a new list to `segments_variants`, which is the concatenation of `max_segment` and `[i - 1]`. 

Given the initial state, `segments_variants` was an empty list, and after the code execution, it will contain one list, which is `max_segment` with the element `i - 1` added to the end. 

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a non-empty list; `max_segment` is [0, 0]; `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, i - 1]]; `max_sum` is -1; the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0; `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`.**
