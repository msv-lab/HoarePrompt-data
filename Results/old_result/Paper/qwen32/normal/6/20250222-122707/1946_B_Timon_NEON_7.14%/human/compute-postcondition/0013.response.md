The code snippet `new_segment = []` resets the `new_segment` list to an empty list. The other variables (`arr`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, and `arr[i]`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; `new_segment` is a non-empty list (now reset to `[]`); `segments_variants` is a list containing either `[0, 0, i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]`; `max_sum` is -1; the current value of `arr[i]` is less than 0. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `max_segment` remains `[0, 0]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.**
