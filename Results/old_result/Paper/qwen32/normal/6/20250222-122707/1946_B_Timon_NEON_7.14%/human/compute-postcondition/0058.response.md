Postcondition: **`arr` remains the same; `new_segment` is either empty or contains the last segment of non-negative integers; `max_segment` contains the segment with the maximum sum and its last index; `segments_variants` contains at least one segment (either `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` or `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`); `max_sum` remains -1; `total_max_segment` is `[-1]` and its first element is less than the first element of `segment`.**
