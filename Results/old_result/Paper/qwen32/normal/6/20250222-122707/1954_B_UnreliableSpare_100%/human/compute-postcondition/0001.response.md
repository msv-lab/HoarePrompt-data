The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variable `arr` as a list. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a certain range, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers that satisfies specific conditions. 

After executing the code snippet, the variable `arr` will hold the list of integers read from the input, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by this snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
