Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Elements to Remove:**
   - The program calculates the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of identical elements (`ans`). However, this is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.
   - For example, in the fourth test case:
     ```
     7
     3 3 3 5 3 3 3
     ```
     The program will output `3` because it finds the contiguous subarray `3 3 3` of length `3` and considers it as the minimum to remove. However, removing just these three elements will not make the array stop being beautiful. The correct answer is `3` because you need to remove the first three `3`s to get `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the array is already not beautiful correctly. For example, if the array is already not beautiful, the program should return `0` instead of `Infinity`.

3. **Incorrect Use of `Decimal('Infinity')`:**
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simple large number or `float('inf')` for comparison purposes.

4. **Logic for Checking if the Array is Already Beautiful:**
   - The program checks if all elements are the same using a flag, but this is not sufficient to determine if the array is beautiful as per the problem definition. The array can be beautiful even if it is not composed of identical elements, as long as the condition `a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1}` holds for all valid `i`.

To fix the program, a more comprehensive approach is needed to identify the minimum number of elements to remove. This includes checking the structure of the array and ensuring that removing the minimum number of elements results in an array that no longer satisfies the beautiful condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        flag = True
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]:
                flag = False
                break
        if flag:
            print(-1)
            continue
        ans = float('inf')
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            j = i
            while j + 1 < n and arr[j] == arr[j + 1]:
                j += 1
            length = j - i + 1
            ans = min(ans, length)
            i = j + 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version properly handles the cases and ensures that the minimum number of elements to remove is calculated correctly.
