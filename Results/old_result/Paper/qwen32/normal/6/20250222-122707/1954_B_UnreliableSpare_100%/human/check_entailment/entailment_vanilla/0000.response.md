Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
- We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array so that it stops being beautiful.
- An array is "beautiful" if all its elements can be made the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` (where `2 <= i <= |a| - 1`) with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.
- If it's impossible to make the array stop being beautiful, the output should be `-1`.

### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Checking if the Array is Uniform:**
   - The program uses a `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same.
   - If all elements are the same (`flag` remains `True`), it outputs `-1` because a uniform array cannot stop being beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding the Minimum Length of Uniform Subarrays:**
   - The program then tries to find the smallest contiguous subarray of uniform elements in the array.
   - It does this by iterating through the array, counting the length of contiguous subarrays of the same value, and keeping track of the smallest such length using `ans`.
   - The smallest length of a uniform subarray is stored in `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the array was uniform (`flag` was `True`), it outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the smallest length of a uniform subarray (`ans`).

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Uniform Array Case:** If all elements are the same, the program correctly outputs `-1` because a uniform array cannot stop being beautiful by removing elements.
- **Non-Uniform Array Case:** The program attempts to find the smallest uniform subarray, but this approach is flawed. The smallest uniform subarray does not necessarily determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The smallest uniform subarray is of length `1`, but removing one element is not enough to make the array non-beautiful. The correct answer is `1` (removing any middle `1` or `2`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make a non-uniform array stop being beautiful. The logic for finding the smallest uniform subarray is insufficient.

Correctness: **False**
