Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `i + 1`, `flag` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `i`, and `flag` remain unchanged. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering the values of the variables.
