To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand how the variables are defined and interact with each other.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable seems to be a loop counter or a test case count, but it is not directly used in the given code snippet.
2. **`n`**: An integer.
3. **`a`**: A list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
4. **`arr`**: A list of integers read from the input. The relationship between `arr` and `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is reasonable to assume `arr` and `a` are the same or closely related.
5. **`flag`**: A boolean variable set to `False`, indicating that not all elements in `arr` are the same.
6. **`val`**: The first element of `arr`, i.e., `arr[0]`.
7. **`cnt`**: The length of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val` if the loop ends with a sequence of such elements.
8. **`ans`**: The minimum value of its previous value and `cnt`. This variable is used to track the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same element.
9. **`i`**: Set to `n-1`, indicating the last index of the list `arr`.

### Analysis:
The variable `ans` is supposed to hold the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same element in the list `arr`. Since `flag` is `False`, it means there is at least one sequence of consecutive elements that are different from the others. The variable `cnt` keeps track of the length of the current sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.

However, the code snippet provided does not include any loop or logic to update `cnt` or `ans`. Therefore, the value of `ans` is not modified from its initial value, which is not explicitly given but can be inferred from the context.

### Inference:
- Since `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val` and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, we can infer that `ans` is initialized to a value that is at least as large as the length of the first sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val`.
- Given that `flag` is `False`, there is at least one sequence of consecutive elements that are different, so `cnt` will be at least 1.
- The minimum possible value of `cnt` is 1 (if all elements are different), and `ans` is initialized to a value that is at least as large as `cnt`.

Without further information on the exact sequence of elements in `arr`, the most precise description we can provide is that `ans` holds the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same element in `arr`.

### Conclusion:
Given the information provided, the `print(ans)` statement will output the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same element in the list `arr`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same element in the list `arr`)**
