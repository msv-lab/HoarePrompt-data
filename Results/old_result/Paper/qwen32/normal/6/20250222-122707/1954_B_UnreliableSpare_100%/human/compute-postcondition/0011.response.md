Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is incremented by 1. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `flag` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
