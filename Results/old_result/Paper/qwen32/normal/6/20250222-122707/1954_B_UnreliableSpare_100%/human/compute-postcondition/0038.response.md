Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True (indicating all elements in `arr` are the same), `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `val` if the loop ends with a sequence of such elements, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, `i` is `n-1`.**
