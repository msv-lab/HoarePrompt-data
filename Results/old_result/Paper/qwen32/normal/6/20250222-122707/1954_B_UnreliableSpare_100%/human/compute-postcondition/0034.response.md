The code snippet provided sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the only change in the state is the value of `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 5, `cnt` is 0.**
