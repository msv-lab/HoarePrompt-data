The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` compares the current value of `ans` with the value of `cnt` and assigns the smaller value back to `ans`. Given that `ans` is initially `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` is `0`, the result of this comparison will be `0` because `0` is less than `Decimal('Infinity')`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `ans` is 0, `val` is `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`**.
