The code snippet provided sets `cnt` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `cnt` changes from its previous value to 0. All other variables retain their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= `n`, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `flag` is False, `val` is `arr[0]`. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0, `i` is 4**.
