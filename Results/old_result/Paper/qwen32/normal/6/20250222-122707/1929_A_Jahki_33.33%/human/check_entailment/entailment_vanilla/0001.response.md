Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements when arranged in a specific order. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This ensures that each difference \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) is as large as possible.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the given program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Sorting and Calculating Beauty:**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The beauty is then calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Conditional Check:**
   - There is a function `func_1` that checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, the program incorrectly prints `0` instead of the actual beauty.

### Issues in the Program
- The conditional check `if func_1(a, num2): print(0)` is incorrect. If the array is already sorted, the beauty should still be calculated and printed, not just `0`.
- The function `func_1` is not necessary for the solution. The program can directly sort the array and calculate the beauty without this check.

### Correctness
Given the issues mentioned, the program is not entirely correct. Specifically, the conditional check that returns `0` for already sorted arrays is incorrect.

### Corrected Program
Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(num):
    num2 = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

### Conclusion
Since the original program contains a logical error, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
