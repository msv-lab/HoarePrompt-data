Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in a; `num2` is an integer representing the length of the array `a`, such that `num2` > 1; `order` is 0. The current value of `a` at index `i-1` is greater than or equal to the current value of `a` at index `i`.**
