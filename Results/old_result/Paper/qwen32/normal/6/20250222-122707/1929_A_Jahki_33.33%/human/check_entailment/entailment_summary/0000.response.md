### Reasoning:
The program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array, i.e., \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. In a sorted array, each difference \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) is non-negative, and the sum of these differences is maximized.

The program follows these steps:
1. Parse the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the array elements.
3. Check if the array is already strictly increasing using the `func_1` function. If it is, the beauty is 0 because no rearrangement can increase the beauty.
4. If the array is not strictly increasing, sort the array and compute the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is strictly increasing by iterating through the array and counting the number of times an element is not less than the next element. If this count is zero, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The main part of the program then correctly sorts the array and computes the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. It handles the edge cases, such as when the array is already strictly increasing, and computes the beauty correctly for other cases.

Correctness: **True**
