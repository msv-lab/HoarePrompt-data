### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to calculate the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in non-decreasing order because the sum of differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array is maximized. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array are the largest possible differences between any two elements.

The program follows this logic by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program. The function `func_1` checks if the array is strictly increasing and returns `True` if it is. If the array is strictly increasing, the program incorrectly prints `0` instead of calculating the beauty. This is incorrect because a strictly increasing array does not imply zero beauty; rather, it implies that the beauty is the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
if func_1(a, num2):
    print(0)
else:
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

The correct approach should be to always sort the array and calculate the beauty, regardless of whether the array is initially strictly increasing or not.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling the case where the array is strictly increasing.
