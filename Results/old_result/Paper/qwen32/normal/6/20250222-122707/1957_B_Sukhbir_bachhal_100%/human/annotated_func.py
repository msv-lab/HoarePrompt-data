#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: n is 0, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and position is the number of bits in the initial n minus 1.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns -2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. It calculates the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary form and returns this value minus one. If `n` is 0, the function returns -1. However, given the constraints, `n` will never be 0, so the function will always return a non-negative integer representing the bit length of `n` minus one.
