The function `highest_set_bit(n)` is not directly related to the input variables n and k as described in the problem. However, based on the problem description, the input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9) representing the number of non-negative integers and their sum, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
