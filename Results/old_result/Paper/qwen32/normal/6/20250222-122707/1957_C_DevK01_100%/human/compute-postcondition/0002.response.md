The code snippet provided modifies the `dp` list by appending a new value to it based on the current values of `dp` and `i`. Hereâ€™s the calculation:

- `dp[-1]` refers to the last element of the `dp` list, which is `1`.
- `dp[-2]` refers to the second last element of the `dp` list, which is also `1`.
- The new value to be appended to `dp` is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
- Substituting the values, we get `(1 + 2 * (2 - 1) * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9) = (1 + 2 * 1 * 1) % (7 + 10 ** 9) = 3 % (7 + 10 ** 9) = 3`.

After this operation, the `dp` list becomes `[1, 1, 3]`.

The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is `2`, and it does not change in this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`, `dp` is [1, 1, 3], `i` is 2**.
