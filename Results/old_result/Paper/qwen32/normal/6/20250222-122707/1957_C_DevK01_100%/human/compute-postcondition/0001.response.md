The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will iterate from 2 to `n` (inclusive). To ensure that the loop executes, `n` must be at least 2, as the loop starts from `i = 2`. The variables `t`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, and `dp` are not directly related to the execution of this loop and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is at least 2, and `i` is now 2 (which is the starting point of the loop).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`, `dp` is `[1, 1]`, `i` is 2**
