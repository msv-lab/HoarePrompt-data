The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition `i in range(2, n + 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is currently 2, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, `c_i`, `dp`) are not part of the loop head and thus should remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n, each of the next `k` lines contains two integers `r_i` and `c_i` where 1 <= `r_i`, `c_i` <= `n`, `dp` is [1, 3], `i` is 3**
