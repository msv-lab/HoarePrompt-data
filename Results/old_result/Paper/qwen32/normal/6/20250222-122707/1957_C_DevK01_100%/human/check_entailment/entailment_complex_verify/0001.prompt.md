You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the i-th move you made, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    dp = [1, 1]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
        
        dp.pop(0)
        
    #State: [dp[n-1], dp[n]]
    return dp[-1]
    #The program returns dp[n]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and returns the value of `dp[n]`, which is computed based on a specific recursive formula modulo 10^9 + 7.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Recap:
1. **Chessboard**: An n x n chessboard.
2. **Players**: You and the computer take turns placing rooks.
3. **Rules**:
   - You place white rooks.
   - The computer places black rooks at the mirrored position (c, r) unless r = c, in which case it skips its turn.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (share the same row or column).
4. **Objective**: Determine the number of different final configurations after k moves (with the computer's implied moves) until no more valid moves are possible.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the board) and `k` (number of moves already made).
   - It then reads `k` pairs `(r, c)` representing your moves.

2. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each move `(r, c)`, it checks if `r != c`.
     - If true, it subtracts 2 from `n` because both the row and column are blocked.
     - If false, it subtracts 1 from `n` because only one position (the diagonal) is blocked.
   - This logic is correct because placing a rook at `(r, c)` blocks the entire row `r` and column `c` for future moves, except when `r == c`, which blocks only one position.

3. **Calculating Configurations**:
   - After processing all moves, the remaining `n` represents the number of free rows or columns.
   - The function `func_1(n)` is called to compute the number of configurations.
   - `func_1(n)` uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining `n` rows/columns.
   - The dynamic programming formula used is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` which correctly counts the number of ways to place rooks in `i` rows/columns without them attacking each other.

4. **Output**:
   - The result of `func_1(n)` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the moves according to the rules, and computes the number of configurations using the correct dynamic programming approach. The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
