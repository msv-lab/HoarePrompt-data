The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from the input. It checks if there exists an integer `i` such that the value at index `v[i]` in the list is `i`. If such an integer is found, it prints `2` and terminates. If no such integer is found after checking all possibilities, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value.
