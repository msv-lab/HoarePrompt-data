You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- Monocarp wants at least 2 friends at his party.
- Each friend `i` has a best friend `p_i`, and `p_i` is distinct for all `i`.
- A friend `i` will come to the party if both `i` and `p_i` receive invitations.
- We need to find the minimum number of invitations to send to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of friends) and the list `p` of best friends.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program initializes a list `v` of size `n+1` with zeros, then replaces it with the input list `p` with an extra zero at the beginning (index 0).
   - It then iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `v[v[i]] == i`, which is a condition that checks if `i` and `p_i` are best friends of each other (i.e., `i` is the best friend of `p_i` and vice versa).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed.
   - If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Case 1**: If there is at least one pair of friends who are best friends of each other (`i` and `p_i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`), then sending invitations to just these two friends will ensure they both come to the party. This is correct, and the program correctly prints `2` in this case.
- **Case 2**: If no such pair exists, the program assumes that it needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends. However, this is not always the case. For example, consider the case where `p = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`. Here, no pair of friends are best friends of each other, but sending invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3 would ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party (since 1's best friend is 3, and 2's best friend is 1, and both 1 and 2 have invitations).

### Conclusion:
The program fails to consider scenarios where no pair of mutual best friends exists, but it is still possible to bring at least 2 friends by sending invitations to 3 friends. Therefore, the program does not always provide the correct minimum number of invitations.
