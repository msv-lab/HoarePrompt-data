The given task involves a `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `v`, `i`), but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables. It simply outputs the integer `2`.

Let's break down the given information and the `print` statement:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
- `n` is an integer input where 2 <= n <= 50.
- `p` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each satisfying 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` != `i`.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, where the first element is `0` and the remaining `n` elements are integers read from the input.
- `i` is set to `1`.
- The condition `v[v[i]]` equals `i` is given, but it does not affect the `print` statement.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2)
```

This statement directly outputs the integer `2`, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **2**
