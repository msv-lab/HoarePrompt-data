Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem described. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, then the minimum number of invitations required is 2. However, this is not always true.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
2 3 4 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this test case, the friendships are arranged in a cycle: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 4, and 4 -> 1. In such a scenario, inviting any two adjacent friends in the cycle will ensure that at least two friends come to the party. For example, inviting friends 1 and 2 will ensure that both 1 and 2 come to the party because 1's best friend (2) and 2's best friend (3) receive invitations.

However, the program incorrectly prints 3 for this case because it does not find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends directly. The program only checks for such pairs and defaults to printing 3 if no such pair is found, which is incorrect for this and similar cases.

Thus, the program does not handle all edge cases correctly, making it incorrect.
