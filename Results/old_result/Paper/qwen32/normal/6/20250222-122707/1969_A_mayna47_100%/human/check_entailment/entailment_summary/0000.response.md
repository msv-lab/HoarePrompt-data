Reasoning:  
The program's logic is based on the observation that if there exists a pair of friends (i, p_i) such that p_i is the best friend of i and i is the best friend of p_i, then inviting both of them will ensure that both come to the party. In this case, the program correctly outputs `2` as the minimum number of invitations needed.

However, the program assumes that if no such pair exists, the answer is always `3`. This assumption is incorrect. There could be other configurations where fewer than 3 invitations are needed to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. For example, consider a scenario where the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 3 or more. In such cases, it might be possible to invite fewer than 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 come to the party.

For instance, if the best friend relationships form a cycle like (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1), inviting friends 1 and 2 would result in both friends 1 and 2 coming to the party. Hence, the program should not always output `3` when no direct mutual best friend pairs are found.

Therefore, the program does not handle all possible configurations correctly.

Correctness: **False**
