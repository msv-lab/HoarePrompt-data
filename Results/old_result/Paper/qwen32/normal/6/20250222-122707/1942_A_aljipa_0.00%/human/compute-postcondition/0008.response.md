To determine the output, we need to analyze the conditions and the value of `res` based on the given initial state.

1. **Initial State Conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer read from input, with the constraint \(2 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
   - `res` is defined based on the value of `k`:
     - If `k` equals `n`, `res` is a list of 1s with length `n`.
     - If `k` equals 1, `res` is a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
     - If `k` is neither `n` nor 1, `res` is a list containing -1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*res)` statement will unpack the `res` list or range object and print its elements separated by spaces.

**Case Analysis:**

- **Case 1: `k` equals `n`**
  - `res` is a list of 1s with length `n`.
  - Example: If `n` is 5, `res` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - Output: **1 1 1 1 1** (repeated `n` times)

- **Case 2: `k` equals 1**
  - `res` is a range object from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Example: If `n` is 5, `res` will be `range(0, 5)`, which corresponds to the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
  - Output: **0 1 2 3 4** (sequence from 0 to `n-1`)

- **Case 3: `k` is neither `n` nor 1**
  - `res` is a list containing -1.
  - Output: **-1**

**Final Answer:**

The output depends on the value of `k`:
- If `k` equals `n`, the output is a sequence of `n` ones.
- If `k` equals 1, the output is a sequence from 0 to `n-1`.
- If `k` is neither `n` nor 1, the output is -1.

Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (n times) if k equals n, 0 1 2 ... n-1 if k equals 1, -1 if k is neither n nor 1**
