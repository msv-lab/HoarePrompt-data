Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

**Initial State:**
- `t` is an integer read from input, such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- `res` is a list of 1s with length `n` if `k` equals `n`.
- `res` is a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1.
- `res` is a list containing -1 if neither condition is met.

**Code Snippet:**
```
print(*res)
```

**Analysis:**
1. The `print(*res)` statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to print all elements of the `res` iterable (list or range) separated by spaces.
2. The value of `res` depends on the values of `k` and `n`:
   - If `k == n`, `res` is a list of 1s with length `n`. For example, if `n` is 5, `res` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - If `k == 1`, `res` is a range object from 0 to `n-1`. For example, if `n` is 5, `res` will be `range(0, 5)`, which will be printed as `0 1 2 3 4`.
   - If neither condition is met, `res` is a list containing -1, i.e., `[-1]`.

**Output Description:**
- If `k == n`, the output will be `1` printed `n` times, separated by spaces.
- If `k == 1`, the output will be the numbers from `0` to `n-1`, each separated by a space.
- If neither condition is met, the output will be `-1`.

**Final Output:**
Output: **1 1 1 ... 1 (n times) if k == n, or 0 1 2 ... n-1 if k == 1, or -1 if neither condition is met**
