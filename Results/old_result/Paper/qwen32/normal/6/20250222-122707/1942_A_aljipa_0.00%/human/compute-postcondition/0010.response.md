The provided code snippet updates the values of `n` and `k` by reading two integers from the input. The initial state specifies that `t`, `n`, and `k` are integers read from input, and `res` is a list initialized based on the values of `n` and `k`. However, the code snippet only affects `n` and `k`.

Given the code:
```
n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
```

The values of `n` and `k` are reassigned based on the new input values. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `res` is not affected by this code snippet since the initialization of `res` is dependent on the values of `n` and `k` before this line, and the new values of `n` and `k` have not yet influenced `res` in the provided code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3; `n` and `k` are the new integers read from the input; `res` is a list of 1s with length `n` if `k` equals `n`, a range object from 0 to `n-1` if `k` equals 1, or a list containing -1 if neither condition is met.**
