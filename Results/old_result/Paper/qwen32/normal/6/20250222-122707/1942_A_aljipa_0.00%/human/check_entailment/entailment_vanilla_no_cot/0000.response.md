Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Case `k == n`:** The program correctly outputs an array with all elements the same (e.g., `[1, 1, ..., 1]`), which results in all cyclic shifts being sorted. This part is correct.

2. **Case `k == 1`:** The program outputs an array with elements ranging from `0` to `n-1` (e.g., `[0, 1, ..., n-1]`). While this array is sorted, only one of its cyclic shifts (the original array itself) will be sorted. This part is also correct.

3. **Case `1 < k < n`:** The program outputs `-1` for these cases. However, it is possible to construct an array where exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 2, 1]` has two sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1]` and `[2, 1, 1]`. The program should handle these cases appropriately.

4. **Case `k = 0`:** This case is not mentioned in the problem statement, but since `k` is guaranteed to be at least `1`, we do not need to handle it.

The program needs to be updated to handle the case where `1 < k < n` correctly, which involves constructing an array that results in exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The current implementation does not address this requirement, making it incorrect for those specific cases.
