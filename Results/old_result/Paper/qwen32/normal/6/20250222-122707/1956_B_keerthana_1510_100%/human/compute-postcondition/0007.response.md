Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the integers on the cards in the player's hand. Each integer from 1 through `n` appears in the sequence at most 2 times. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information.**
