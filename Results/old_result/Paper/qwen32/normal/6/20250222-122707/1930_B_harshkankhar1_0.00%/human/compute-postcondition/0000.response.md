The code snippet creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is provided by the user input. The variable `t` (number of test cases) is not used in the provided code snippet, so it remains unchanged. The variable `n` is used to determine the length of the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the variable `n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5. After executing the code, `a` will be a list of integers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Output State: **Each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation p. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) indicating the number of test cases. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n.**
