The code appends a tuple `(v, True)` to the `stack`. This means that the stack now contains the previously remaining tuples plus this new tuple at the end. The other variables (`v`, `postorder`, `tree`, `s`, `x`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v` is the vertex that was last pushed onto the stack, `postorder` is the boolean value that was the second part of the last tuple on the stack, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped plus the new tuple `(v, True)`.**
