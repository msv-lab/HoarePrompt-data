The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, or `tree`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is the number of edges to be removed such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `u` and `v` are the two integers read from the input.**
