The only variable in the loop head is `u`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute for each child of `tree.vertices[v]`. At the end of the last iteration, `u` was the last child of `tree.vertices[v]` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `u` must be the next child in the list of `tree.vertices[v].children`.

State: **`v` is the first element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the popped tuple from `stack`, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class where `tree.vertices[v].children` is a non-empty list, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, `stack` has one more tuple `(v, True)` and one more tuple `(u, False)` than before, `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[v].children`**
