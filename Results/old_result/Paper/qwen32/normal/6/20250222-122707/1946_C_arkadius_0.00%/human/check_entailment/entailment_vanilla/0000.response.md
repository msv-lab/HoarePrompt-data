Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a given tree, all remaining connected components have at least \( x \) vertices.

### Program Analysis

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \). Here's a breakdown of the key functions:

1. **func_1 and func_2**: These functions perform a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of "good components" and the remaining size of each subtree. A "good component" is defined as a subtree that has at least \( x \) vertices. 
   - **func_1** uses an iterative post-order traversal with a stack.
   - **func_2** uses a recursive post-order traversal.

2. **func_3**: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that all remaining connected components have at least \( x \) vertices. It uses the results from `func_1` to determine the number of good components and the remaining size.

3. **func_4**: This function performs a binary search on the possible values of \( x \) to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition checked by `func_3`.

4. **func_5**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree at vertex 0, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum \( x \).

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - The tree is constructed from the input edges.
   - The tree is rooted at vertex 0, which is a valid approach for tree traversal and component size calculations.

2. **Post-order Traversal**:
   - Both `func_1` and `func_2` perform post-order traversals to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree. This is correct because post-order traversal ensures that the sizes of children are calculated before the parent, which is necessary for the calculations.

3. **Binary Search**:
   - The binary search in `func_4` correctly narrows down the possible values of \( x \) by checking the feasibility of each mid-value using `func_3`.

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The feasibility check in `func_3` ensures that the number of good components is at least \( k \) and that the remaining size of the root component (if not a good component) is at least \( x \).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the required logic to find the maximum \( x \) using a combination of tree traversal and binary search. The logic is consistent with the problem requirements, and the implementation is sound.

**Correctness: True**
