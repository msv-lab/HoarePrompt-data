Postcondition: **`v` is the vertex that was last pushed onto the stack, `postorder` is the boolean value that was the second part of the last tuple on the stack, `tree` is an instance of a Tree class, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex for the traversal, `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges, and `stack` contains the remaining tuples after the last tuple has been popped. If `postorder` is False, then `stack` also includes the new tuple `(v, True)` and the new tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of `v`.**
