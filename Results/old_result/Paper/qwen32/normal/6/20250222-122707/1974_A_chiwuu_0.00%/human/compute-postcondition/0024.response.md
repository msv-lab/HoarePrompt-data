The code snippet takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, and splits them from the input string. The initial state mentions that `a` and `b` are integers, but their specific values are not provided. After the input operation, `a` and `b` will be assigned the values from the input, and all other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `t` is calculated as `b * 2 // 5` if `b * 2` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `i` is not defined in the initial state and has not been changed**
