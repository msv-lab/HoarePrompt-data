Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an integer (converted from the string `a`); `b` is an integer (converted from the string `b`); If `t` (which is `b * 2`) is divisible by 5, then `t` is updated to `b * 2 // 5`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`. `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. `t1` is less than `a`.**
