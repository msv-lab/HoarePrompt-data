Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an integer (converted from the string `a`); `b` is an integer (converted from the string `b`); `t` is calculated as `b * 2 // 5` if `b * 2` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`.**
