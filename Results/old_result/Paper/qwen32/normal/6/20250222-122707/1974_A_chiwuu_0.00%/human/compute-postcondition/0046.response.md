Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0, and `t` is `(2 * b) // 5` if `(2 * b) % 5 == 0`; otherwise, `t` is `((2 * b) // 5) + 1`.**
