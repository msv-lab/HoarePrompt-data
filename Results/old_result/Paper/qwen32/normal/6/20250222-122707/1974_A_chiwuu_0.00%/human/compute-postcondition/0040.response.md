Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as a string, `b` is the second value from the input split as a string, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to `a` and `b` as strings. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
