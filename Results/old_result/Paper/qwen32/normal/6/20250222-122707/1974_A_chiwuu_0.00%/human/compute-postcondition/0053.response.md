Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is the first value from the input split as an integer, `b` is the second value from the input split as an integer, `i` is 0. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t1` remains as `t * 15 - b * 4` where `t` is `(2 * b) // 5` if `(2 * b) % 5 == 0`; otherwise, `t` is `((2 * b) // 5) + 1`. If `t1` is less than `a`, then `t2` is recalculated as `a - t1`, and `t` is updated to `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`; otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. In both cases, `t1` is recalculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.**
