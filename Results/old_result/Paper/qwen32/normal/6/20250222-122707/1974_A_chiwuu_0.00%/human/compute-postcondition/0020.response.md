Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` and `b` are integers, `t` is updated based on the divisibility of `t2` by 15. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is increased by `t2 // 15 + 1`. `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`. `t2` is recalculated as `a - t1` and retains its divisibility status by 15.**
