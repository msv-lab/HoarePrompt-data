Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99; `a` is an integer (converted from the string `a`); `b` is an integer (converted from the string `b`); `t` is `b * 2 // 5` and `t` is divisible by 5.**

The value of `t` has been updated to be `b * 2 // 5`, which is still divisible by 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
