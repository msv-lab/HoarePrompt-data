You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` takes no input arguments but operates on multiple test cases provided through standard input. Each test case consists of two integers, x and y, where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons, respectively. The first line of input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which denotes the number of test cases that follow.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b * 2
        
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: The output state is the sequence of `t` values printed for each of the `n` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of 15x15 grids required to cover all the icons.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining the minimum number of 5x3 screens needed to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons.

### Key Points:
1. **2x2 Icons:** Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since each screen is 5x3 (15 cells), we can fit a maximum of 3 2x2 icons per screen (3 * 4 = 12 cells used, 3 cells left).
2. **1x1 Icons:** After placing the 2x2 icons, we can fill the remaining cells with 1x1 icons.

### Steps to Solve:
1. Calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine if the remaining 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space or if additional screens are required.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2  # This line is incorrect; it should be b (number of 2x2 icons) not b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `t`:** The variable `t` is incorrectly calculated as `b * 2`. It should simply be `b` because `t` represents the number of screens needed for `b` 2x2 icons.
2. **Calculation of `t1`:** The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct in principle, but `t` should be calculated properly first.
3. **Logic for Remaining 1x1 Icons:** The logic to determine the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is correct.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b  # Corrected: t should be b, not b * 2
        if t % 3 == 0:
            t = t // 3
        else:
            t = t // 3 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)

func()
```

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of `t`. The corrected version of the program is provided above.
