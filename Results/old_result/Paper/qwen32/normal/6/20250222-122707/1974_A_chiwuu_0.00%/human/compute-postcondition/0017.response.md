The code snippet provided increments the value of `t` by the integer division of `t2` by 15. Given the initial state, we need to reflect this change in the output state.

Initial State Recap:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99
- `a` is an integer (converted from the string `a`)
- `b` is an integer (converted from the string `b`)
- `t` is calculated such that if `b * 2` is divisible by 5, `t` equals `b * 2 // 5`, otherwise `t` equals `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1` and `t2` is divisible by 15

The code snippet modifies `t` as follows:
```
t = t + t2 // 15
```

Since `t2` is divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` is an integer. The new value of `t` is the original `t` plus this integer.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `t` is the original `t` plus `t2 // 15`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1` and `t2` is divisible by 15.**
