To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the context and the values of the variables involved.

From the initial state, we know:
- `sz` is 0.
- `rdb` is a list containing elements from `rgt[1]` to `rgt[n-1]` that are equal to their preceding element.
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end.
- `ldb` is a list containing at least one element.
- `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2.

However, the variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `elem` is not provided with a specific value, we can infer that `elem` must be defined somewhere in the code before the `print` statement is executed. Given the context, `elem` is likely to be an element from one of the lists (`lft`, `rgt`, `sng`, `ldb`) or a value derived from these lists.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not end the line (due to `end=' '`).

Therefore, the output can be described as follows:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is a value derived from the lists lft, rgt, sng, or ldb or a value related to them)**
