Output State: **T is an integer greater than 0, n is greater than 1, k is the second integer from the input, a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, lst is a list of integers from the input, lft is a sorted list containing the first n elements of lst, rgt is a sorted list containing the elements of lst from index n to the end, ldb contains all elements that appear twice consecutively in lft, sng contains all elements in lft that are not part of a consecutive pair and are not at the boundaries of such pairs. rdb contains all elements in rgt that appear twice consecutively. i is n.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the variable `rdb` will contain all the elements from the list `rgt` that appear consecutively. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations from 1 to `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state or as they were affected by the loop's logic up to this point.
