Postcondition: **`sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 1, `sng` is a list with at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element of `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
