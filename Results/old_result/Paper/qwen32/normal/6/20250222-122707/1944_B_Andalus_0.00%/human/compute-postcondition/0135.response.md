The code snippet appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Therefore, `sng` will now contain the value of `lft[i]` as its last element. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n - 1`, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**
