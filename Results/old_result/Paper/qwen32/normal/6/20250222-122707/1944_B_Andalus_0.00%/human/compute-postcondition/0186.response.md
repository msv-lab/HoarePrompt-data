To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. `sng` must contain at least one element.
2. There is a condition involving `sz` and `k` that can break out of a loop or if statement, but the exact loop or if statement is not provided in the snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact behavior of `sz` and `k` without additional context.
3. The `print` statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`, which means it prints the value of `elem` followed by a space, without a newline.

### Key Variable:
- `elem`: This variable is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state. The value of `elem` would depend on where it is assigned in the code that is not provided. However, since the task is to determine what will be printed based on the given information, we can infer that `elem` must be defined somewhere in the code before the `print` statement.

### Output Determination:
Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we need to describe the output in terms of `elem`. The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space.

### Final Answer:
Output: **elem (where elem is the value of the variable elem)**
