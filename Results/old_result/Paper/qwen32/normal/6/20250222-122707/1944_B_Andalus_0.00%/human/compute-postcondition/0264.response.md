The code snippet appends the element at index `i` of `lft` to the list `sng`. Given that `i` is `k + 2`, the element `lft[k + 2]` is added to `sng`.

Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains `lft[i]` and `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list and `sng` contains the first `k` elements of `lft`. Additionally, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `i` is `k + 2`. `sng` now includes the element `lft[k + 2]`.**

In simpler terms: The element at index `k + 2` of `lft` has been added to `sng`. All other conditions and states remain the same.
