Output State: **`sz` is an integer, `sng` is a list where the first `k` elements have been printed, and `rdb` is a list that must have at least 1 element. If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the values of `sz`, `sng`, and `rdb` remain the same as per the initial state. The only change is that we exit the current loop or if statement.
