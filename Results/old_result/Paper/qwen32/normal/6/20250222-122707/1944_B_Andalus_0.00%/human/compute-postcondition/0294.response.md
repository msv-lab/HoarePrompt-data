The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has more elements, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the next element in `ldb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` should be updated to the next element in `ldb`.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `ldb`, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the next element in the list `ldb`.

State: **`sz` is either 2 or remains unchanged, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` and `k` are set to the values provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have duplicates and must have at least 1 element; `rdb` is a list containing all elements in `rgt` that have duplicates consecutively; `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that appear exactly once and are not part of a sequence of duplicates; `i` is `n-1`; `elem` is the next element in `ldb`. If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is not exited.**

Given that `elem` is the loop variable, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the next element in `ldb`. Therefore, we do not need to explicitly state that `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `i` are unchanged, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`elem` is the next element in `ldb`.**
