To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the context in which the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
1. **`sz`**: An integer that is incremented by 2 and is still less than `k`.
2. **`k`**: An integer.
3. **`elem`**: The subsequent element in `sng`.

### Conditions:
- The loop or if statement breaks if `sz` is not less than `k`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is executed within a loop or conditional block that continues as long as `sz` is less than `k`.
- `elem` is the subsequent element in `sng` (presumably a list or iterable).
- The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function means that after printing `elem`, a space will be added instead of a newline.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space. Since `elem` is described as the subsequent element in `sng`, we need to know the value of `elem` to provide the exact output. However, based on the given information, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the subsequent element in the list or iterable `sng`) **
