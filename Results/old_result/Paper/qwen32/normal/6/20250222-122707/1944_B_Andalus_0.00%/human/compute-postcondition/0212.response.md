To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the context of the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Recap:
1. **`sz`**: An integer.
2. **`sng`**: A list where the first `k` elements have been printed.
3. **`rdb`**: A list that must have at least 1 element.
4. **Condition on `sz`**:
   - If `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is updated to 2.
   - Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.
   - If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

### Code Snippet to Analyze:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

### Key Points to Consider:
- The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we need to infer its value based on the context.
- The print statement prints `elem` twice, separated by a space, and does not move to a new line after printing (due to `end=' '`).

### Inference:
- Since `elem` is not defined in the initial state, it must be defined within the context of the code that is not provided here. However, we can assume that `elem` is an element from the list `rdb` or `sng` based on the typical usage of such variables in loops.
- Given the context, `elem` is likely to be an element from `rdb` or `sng` that is being processed in a loop.

### Output Description:
- The output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, separated by a space, and no newline at the end.

Since we don't have the exact value of `elem`, we can describe it as a variable that is being processed in the loop.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the current element being processed in the loop)**
