Postcondition: **`sz` is either 0, 2, 4, or the value remains unchanged if it is already greater than or equal to `k`. `rdb` must contain at least one element, and `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `rdb` or `elem`.**
