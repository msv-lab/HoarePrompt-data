The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, and it iterates over the elements of the list `sng`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `sng` and `elem`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the first element of `sng`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `sng` after `elem`. Therefore, `elem` should be updated to the next element in the list `sng`.

State: **`sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 1, `sng` is a list with at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element of `sng`.**
