The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, ensuring that the range `(1, n)` contains at least one value.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
