Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is equal to `k` if `k` is achievable with the number of pairs in `rdb`, otherwise `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`. `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. All other variables remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
