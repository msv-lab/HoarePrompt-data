Output State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`; `ldb` is a list containing `lft[i]`; `rdb` is an empty list; `sng` is an empty list; `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, `ldb` now contains the element `lft[i]` that was appended to it in the code snippet. All other variables retain their initial state values.
