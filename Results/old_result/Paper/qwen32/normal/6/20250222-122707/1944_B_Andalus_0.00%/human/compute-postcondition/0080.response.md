The provided `print()` statement in the code snippet is empty. This means it will not print anything specific to the variables or objects described in the initial state. An empty `print()` statement in Python outputs a newline character.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print()` statement is empty, so no arguments are passed to it.
2. In Python, when `print()` is called without any arguments, it outputs a newline character.

Therefore, the output will simply be a newline.

Output: **(newline)**
