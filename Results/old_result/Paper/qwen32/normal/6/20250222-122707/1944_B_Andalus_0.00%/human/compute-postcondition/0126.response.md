The code snippet provided is `rdb = []`. This line of code reassigns `rdb` to an empty list, regardless of its previous state.

Given the initial state:
- `sz` is equal to `k`
- All elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`
- `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `k` is the second integer from the input
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`
- `rgt` is a list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end
- `ldb` is an empty list

After executing `rdb = []`, the only change is that `rdb` is explicitly set to an empty list. All other variables retain their previous values and states.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list.**
