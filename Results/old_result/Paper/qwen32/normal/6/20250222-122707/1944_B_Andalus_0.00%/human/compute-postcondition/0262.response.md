The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

State: **`sz` is `k`, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is set to the value provided by the input; `lst` is a list of integers provided by the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of `lst`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains `lft[i]` and `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is an empty list and `sng` contains the first `k` elements of `lft`. Additionally, if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `i` is `k + 2`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` now includes the element `lft[k + 2]`**.
