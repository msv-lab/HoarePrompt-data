The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, and it is used to iterate over the elements in `rdb`. Since `rdb` must contain at least one element, the loop can execute at least once. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state and how the loop progresses.

Given:
- `sz` is either 0 or 2.
- `rdb` must contain at least one element.
- If `sz` is 2, `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.

Since `elem` is the variable being iterated over `rdb`, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` will take the value of the next element in `rdb`.

Considering that `rdb` must contain at least one element and the loop is starting its next iteration, `elem` will be the first element of `rdb` if this is the first iteration, or the next element in `rdb` if this is a subsequent iteration.

Since the problem does not specify the current position of `elem` in `rdb`, we can assume that `elem` is currently the first element, and at the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the next element in `rdb`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`**.

If we assume that the current `elem` is the first element, then at the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the second element, and so on. However, without loss of generality and based on the information provided, we can state:

State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`**.
