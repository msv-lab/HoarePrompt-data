The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. 

Given the initial state, `i` is `k + 1`, and `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`. Therefore, the element at index `i` of `lft` is added to `sng`.

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `i` is `k + 1`, `sng` contains the element at index `i` of `lft` appended to it.**
