The code snippet `ldb.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given the initial state, `ldb` was previously an empty list. After executing this line, `ldb` will contain one element, which is `lft[i]`.

Here's the updated output state:

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is a list containing `lft[i]`, `i` is `k + 1`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `ldb` contains the element at index `i` of `lft`. Otherwise, `sng` contains `lft[i]` if `i` is greater than 0, less than `n - 1`, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains unchanged.**
