The code snippet `lft = lst[:n]` creates a new list `lft` that contains the first `n` elements of the list `lst`. The values of `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and the remaining elements of `lst` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, and `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.**
