Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is equal to `k` if `k` is achievable with the number of pairs in `rdb`, otherwise `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`. `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is now `sz + 1`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. All other variables remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is `sz + 1`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is `sz + 1`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
