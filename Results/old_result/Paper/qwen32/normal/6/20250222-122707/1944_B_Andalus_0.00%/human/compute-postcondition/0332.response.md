Output State: **`sz` is either 2 or 4, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `rdb` or `elem`.**

Natural Language: The value of `sz` has been increased by 2. If `sz` was initially 0, it is now 2. If `sz` was initially 2, it is now 4. The conditions related to `rdb` and `elem` remain unchanged.
