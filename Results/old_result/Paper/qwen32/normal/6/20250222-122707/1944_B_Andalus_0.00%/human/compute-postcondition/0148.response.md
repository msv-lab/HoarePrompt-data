To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the changes it makes to the variables.

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, it checks if the current element in `lft` is the same as the previous one or different from both its neighboring elements. Based on these conditions, it either appends the element to `ldb` (if it's a duplicate of the previous one) or to `sng` (if it's unique in its position).

Given the initial state and the description of the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **`sz`**: It remains equal to `k` throughout the loop as it is not modified in the loop.
2. **`rdb`**: It remains an empty list as no elements are added to it in the given output states for the first three iterations.
3. **`T`**: It remains greater than 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
4. **`n`**: It remains the first integer from the input.
5. **`k`**: It remains the second integer from the input.
6. **`lst`**: It remains the list of integers obtained from the input.
7. **`lft`**: It remains a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`.
8. **`rgt`**: It remains a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end.
9. **`ldb`**: It remains an empty list as no elements are added to it in the given output states for the first three iterations.
10. **`sng`**: It accumulates elements that are unique in their position in `lft`.

The only variables that change are `i`, `ldb`, and `sng`. Since `ldb` remains empty in the given states, we can infer that no duplicates were found in the first three iterations. `sng` accumulates unique elements, and `i` increments from 1 to `n-1`.

After all iterations (from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`):
- `i` will be `n`.
- `sng` will contain all elements in `lft` that are unique in their position.
- `ldb` will still be an empty list if no duplicates were found throughout the loop.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`sz` is equal to `k`, all elements up to the point where `sz` equals `k` have been printed from `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements from `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements from `lst` starting from the `n`-th index to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` contains elements from `lft` that are unique in their position, and `i` is `n`.**
