Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first n elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list (or contains elements that were not processed because `sz` reached `k`), `sng` contains at least one element that is in `lft` and is not part of a consecutive pair and is not at the boundaries of such pairs, `rdb` contains all elements in `rgt` that appear twice consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, and `sz` is equal to `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of all the variables remain unchanged. The execution of the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without altering any of the variable values.
