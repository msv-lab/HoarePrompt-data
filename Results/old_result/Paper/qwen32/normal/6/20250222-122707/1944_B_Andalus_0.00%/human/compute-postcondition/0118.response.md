The code snippet `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. The other variables (`sng`, `elem`, `rdb`, and the condition `if sz >= k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `sz` is the previous value of `sz` plus one.

Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is `sz + 1`, `rdb` is empty if all elements in `rdb` have been processed, otherwise it contains the remaining elements. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
