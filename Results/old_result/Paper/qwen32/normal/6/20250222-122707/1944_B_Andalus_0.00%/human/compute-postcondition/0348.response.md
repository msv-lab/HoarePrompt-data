Output State: **`sz` is incremented by 1; if `sz` was initially equal to `k` (and `k` is even), then `sz` is now `k + 1` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `sz` is now an odd number greater than the largest even number less than `k`; `rdb` and `sng` remain unchanged; `sng` must have at least one more element; `elem` is the next element in `sng` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The value of `sz` is increased by 1. If `sz` was initially equal to `k` (and `k` is even), `sz` is now `k + 1` and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `sz` is now an odd number greater than the largest even number less than `k`. The variables `rdb` and `sng` remain unchanged, `sng` still has at least one more element, and `elem` is the next element in `sng`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
