In the provided for loop, the loop iterates over the elements in the `results` list. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. The variables in the loop head are `result` and `results`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the integer value of the last user input.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `t` is 0.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, which means it is currently an empty list since `t` is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state so that the `results` list contains at least one element. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1, and `results` must be a list with at least one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

State: **`n` is the integer value of the last user input, `a` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `c` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing 1 element which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**
