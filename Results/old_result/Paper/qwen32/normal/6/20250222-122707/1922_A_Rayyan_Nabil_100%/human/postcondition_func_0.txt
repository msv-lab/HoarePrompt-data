The function `func_1` accepts three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20 inclusive. The function checks each position in the strings to determine if the character in `c` at that position matches the character in either `a` or `b`. If there is at least one position where the character in `c` does not match the character in either `a` or `b`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
