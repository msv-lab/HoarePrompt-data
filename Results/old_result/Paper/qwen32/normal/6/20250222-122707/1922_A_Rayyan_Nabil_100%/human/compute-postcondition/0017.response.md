The code snippet `b = input().strip()` updates the value of `b` to a new string provided by the user input, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. The values of `n`, `a`, `c`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new integer value of the user input, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `b` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input (updated), `c` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing two elements which are the results of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` called twice.**
