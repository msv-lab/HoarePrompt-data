The code snippet provided reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value of the new user input. This means the previous value of `n` is discarded, and `n` now holds the new integer value provided by the user. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new integer value of the user input, `a` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input, `t` is `t - 1`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
