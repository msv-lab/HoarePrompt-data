Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find a template `t` such that:
1. Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
2. String `c` does not match the template `t`.

For a character in the template:
- If the character is lowercase, the corresponding character in the string must be the same.
- If the character is uppercase, the corresponding character in the string must be different (from the lowercase version of the template character).

### Program Analysis:
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(n, a, b, c)`: This function checks if there exists at least one position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', indicating that a valid template can be constructed. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1()`, and prints the results.

### Correctness Check:
The program's logic is flawed. Here's why:
- The condition `if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` checks only if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. However, it does not ensure that a template `t` can be constructed such that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.
- For example, consider the case where `a[i] == b[i] != c[i]`. This satisfies the condition in `func_1()`, but it does not guarantee that a template character can be chosen to match `a[i]` and `b[i]` while not matching `c[i]`.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider an input:
```
1
1
a
a
b
```
- According to the problem, we need a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, and `c` does not.
- The program will return 'YES' because `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`, but there is no valid template `t` that can be constructed to satisfy the problem's conditions.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic to determine the validity of the template is insufficient.

Correctness: **False**
