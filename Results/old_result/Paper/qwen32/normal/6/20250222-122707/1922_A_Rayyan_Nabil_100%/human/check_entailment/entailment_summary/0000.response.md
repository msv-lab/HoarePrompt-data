### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. The main function `func_2` handles input and output, while `func_1` performs the core logic.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not.
- **Logic**: For each position `i` in the strings, it checks if the character in `c` at position `i` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES', indicating that a valid template `t` exists. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: Read input, process each test case using `func_1`, and print the results.
- **Logic**: It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the result. Finally, it prints all the results.

#### Analysis:
The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function checks if there is at least one position where the character in `c` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that a valid template `t` exists where `a` and `b` match `t` and `c` does not match `t`.

To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should ensure that:
- For each position `i`, if `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (and `b[i]`).
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then the template can have either an uppercase letter (which does not match `a[i]` or `b[i]`) or the lowercase letter `a[i]` or `b[i]` (which matches `a[i]` or `b[i]` respectively).

The current logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement this requirement. For example, in the third test case, the correct template is "CODEforces", but `func_1` would incorrectly return 'NO'.

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine if there exists a valid template `t` for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
