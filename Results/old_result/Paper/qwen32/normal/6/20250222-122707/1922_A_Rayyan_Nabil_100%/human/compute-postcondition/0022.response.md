Let's analyze the given task step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `n` is the integer value of the last user input.
- `a` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input.
- `b` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input.
- `c` is the last string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters provided by the user input.
- `t` is 1.
- `results` is a list containing 1 element which is the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(result)
```

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Variable `result`**: The code snippet is attempting to print a variable named `result`. However, based on the given initial state, there is no variable named `result`. Instead, there is a variable named `results`, which is a list containing one element.

2. **Variable `results`**: `results` is a list with one element, which is the result of the function call `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. 

3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided initial state, so we cannot determine its exact output. However, we know that `results[0]` holds the result of this function call.

### Conclusion:
The code snippet contains a typo. It should print `results[0]` instead of `result`. Given the initial state, the correct print statement should reference `results[0]`.

However, based on the provided code snippet, since `result` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError`. But, if we assume the intention was to print the first element of the `results` list, the output would be the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

### Output:
Since the variable `result` is not defined, the code will raise an error. But, based on the intention to print the result of the function call, the output would be:

Output: **results[0] (where results[0] is the result of func_1(n, a, b, c))**
