The code snippet `n = int(input().strip())` will change the value of `n` to the integer value of the input provided by the user. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, but this value will be overwritten by the input. The other variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the user input, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is a positive integer, `results` is an empty list.**
