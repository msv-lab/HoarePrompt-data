The code snippet `max_segment = new_segment` updates the value of `max_segment` to be the same as `new_segment`. The other variables (`arr`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Since `new_segment` is a list that could contain one or more elements, `max_segment` will now hold the same list. The specific contents of `new_segment` are not provided, so we'll represent it as `new_segment`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is `new_segment`, `segments_variants` contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty, `i` is incremented by 1**.
