The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it ranges over the length of `arr`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `arr` must have at least one element. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Given this, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one integer. The other variables can remain as they are since their states do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is `-1`**
