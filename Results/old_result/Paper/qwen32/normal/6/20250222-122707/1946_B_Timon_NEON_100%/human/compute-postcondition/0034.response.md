Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. `max_segment` is updated such that if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[i]` and `segments_variants` contains either `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` was greater than `new_segment[0]` before the update, or `new_segment + [i - 1]` otherwise; if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. `max_sum` remains `-1`. `new_segment` is an empty list if `arr[i]` is less than 0, or `[new_segment[0] + arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0. `i` is incremented by 1.**
