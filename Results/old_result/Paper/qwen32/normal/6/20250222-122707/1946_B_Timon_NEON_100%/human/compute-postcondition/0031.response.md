The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` modifies the first element of the list `max_segment` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. 

Given the initial state, `max_segment` is a list where the first element is updated by adding `arr[i]` to it. The other variables (`arr`, `max_sum`, `new_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `i`) remain unchanged unless directly modified by the code, which they are not in this case.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is updated such that `max_segment[0]` is now `max_segment[0] + arr[i]`, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is an empty list, `segments_variants` contains `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` was greater than `new_segment[0]` before the update, otherwise it contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0, `i` is incremented by 1.**
