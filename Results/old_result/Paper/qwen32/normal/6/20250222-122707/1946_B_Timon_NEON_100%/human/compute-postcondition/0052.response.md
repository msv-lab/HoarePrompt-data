Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is updated accordingly, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `new_segment` was `True` and `arr[i]` is less than 0, `new_segment[0]` is reset to `[]`. Otherwise, if `new_segment` was `True`, `new_segment[0]` is also increased by `arr[i]`. If `new_segment` was `False` and `arr[i] >= 0`, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. `segments_variants` includes a new segment which is either `max_segment` followed by `[i - 1]` or `new_segment + [i - 1]` depending on the condition.**
