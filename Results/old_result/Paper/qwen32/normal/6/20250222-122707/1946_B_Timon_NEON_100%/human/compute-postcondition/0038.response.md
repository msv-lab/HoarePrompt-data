Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer. `max_segment` is updated such that `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`. `segments_variants` is updated to contain either `max_segment + [i - 1]` if `max_segment[0]` was greater than `new_segment[0]` before the update and `arr[i]` is less than 0, or `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0. `max_sum` remains `-1`. `new_segment` is updated to `[new_segment[0] + arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was not empty; otherwise, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, or an empty list if `arr[i]` is less than 0. `i` is incremented by 1.**
