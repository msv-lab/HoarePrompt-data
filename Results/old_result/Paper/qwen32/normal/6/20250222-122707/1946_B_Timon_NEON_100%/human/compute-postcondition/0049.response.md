The code snippet assigns a new list `[arr[i], i]` to the variable `new_segment`. This means `new_segment` now holds the current element of `arr` at index `i` and the index `i` itself. The other variables (`arr`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, `max_sum`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is updated such that `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`, `segments_variants` is updated accordingly, `max_sum` remains `-1`, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language: The list `new_segment` is now `[arr[i], i]`. All other variables retain their previous states.
