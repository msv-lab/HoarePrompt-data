The given Python code snippet modifies the value of `new_segment[0]` by adding `arr[i]` to it. Let's break down the impact of this operation on the variables based on the initial state provided.

Initial State: 
- `arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer.
- `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]` with its first element increased by `arr[i]`.
- `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0.
- `max_sum` remains `-1`.
- `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
new_segment[0] += arr[i]
```

This modifies `new_segment[0]` by adding `arr[i]` to it. None of the other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer; `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]` with its first element increased by `arr[i]`; `segments_variants` is either empty or contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0; `max_sum` remains `-1`; `new_segment` is `[new_segment[0] + arr[i], i]`; `i` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms, `new_segment[0]` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
