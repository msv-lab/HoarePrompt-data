### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and see if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

1. **Main Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and the number of operations.
   - It then calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
   - The result from `func_2` is used to compute the final answer based on the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - The final answer is then taken modulo `10^9 + 7` using `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simply returns the input number modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - This part is correct as per the problem's requirement.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is supposed to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
   - The logic seems to be a variation of Kadane's algorithm, but with additional complexities.
   - It tracks the maximum sum of segments and their end indices.
   - The function returns the segment with the maximum sum.

### Issues in `func_2`:
- **Handling Negative Numbers:** The function does not handle negative numbers correctly. Specifically, if all numbers are negative, it should return the maximum single element, not zero.
- **Logic Flaws:** The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle cases where the maximum subarray sum is negative or when the subarray sum resets to zero.
- **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle edge cases such as arrays with all negative numbers or arrays with zeros correctly.

### Example Analysis:
Let's take the first test case from the example:
- Input: `2 2 -4 -7`
- Expected Output: `999999996` (which is `-11 % 1000000007`)
- `func_2` should return `[0, 0]` because all elements are negative, and the maximum sum of any subarray is zero.
- The computed answer would be `0 * 2 ** 2 + (-4 - 7) - 0 = -11`, which is correct when taken modulo `1000000007`.

However, for the third test case:
- Input: `3 3 2 2 8`
- Expected Output: `96`
- `func_2` should return `[12, 2]` because the maximum sum of any subarray is `12` (the sum of the entire array).
- The computed answer would be `12 * 2 ** 3 + (2 + 2 + 8) - 12 = 96`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program has issues in `func_2` that prevent it from correctly finding the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, especially in cases where the maximum sum is negative or involves handling zeros and negative numbers correctly.

**Correctness: False**
