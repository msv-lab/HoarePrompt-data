Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `max_segment` is updated based on the value of `arr[i]`. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` contains `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `max_segment` is set to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` contains `new_segment + [i - 1]` if `arr[i]` is less than 0. `max_sum` remains `-1`. `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[i], i]` if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `new_segment` was empty; otherwise, `new_segment[0]` is updated by `arr[i]` if `new_segment` was not empty. `i` is incremented by 1.**
