The only object in the loop head is the variable `segment`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `segment` for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `segment` was `[3, 4, -1]`. Since `segments_variants` is a list with at least two segments, there must be at least one more segment that can be assigned to `segment` in the next iteration.

Let's assume the next segment in `segments_variants` is the second segment in the list, which is `[1, 0, 0]`.

State: **`arr` is [1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2], `new_segment` is [2, 5], `max_segment` is [11, 0], `segments_variants` is a list with at least two segments (e.g., [[1, 0, 0], [3, 4, -1]]), `max_sum` is -1, `segment` is [1, 0, 0]**
