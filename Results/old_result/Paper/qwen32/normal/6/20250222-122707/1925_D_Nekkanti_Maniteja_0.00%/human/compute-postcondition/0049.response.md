The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This changes the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `M`, `c`, `a`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and conditions, but `s` and `i` have specific expressions that are not directly affected by the input operation.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input; `s` is `s + c * a * k + c * c * m * (k-1) * k / 2`; `i` is incremented by 1; `M`, `c`, and `a` remain the same.**
