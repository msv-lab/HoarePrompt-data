### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary, and then compare it with the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis

The task is to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The expected value needs to be expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, and the result should be \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

#### Program Analysis

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)  # Incorrect calculation of modular inverse
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a  # Incorrect calculation of expected value
        print(s % M)
```

1. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is correctly set to `10^9 + 7`.
   - `c` is intended to be the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs, which is `1 / (n * (n - 1) / 2)`. However, `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` is incorrect because `n * (n - 1) // 1` is just `n * (n - 1)`. It should be `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - `a` is correctly calculated as the sum of all initial friendship values.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` is intended to calculate the expected value over `k` excursions. However, the expression `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect.
   - The correct expected value calculation involves summing up the expected contributions of each pair over `k` excursions, considering their initial friendship values and the incremental increase.

#### Correct Approach

The correct approach involves:
1. Calculating the expected contribution of each pair over `k` excursions.
2. Summing these contributions and computing the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

The expected contribution of a pair with initial friendship value `f` chosen `x` times is:
\[ \text{Expected Contribution} = f \cdot \frac{x}{\binom{n}{2}} + \sum_{j=1}^{x-1} \frac{j}{\binom{n}{2}} \]
where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

The sum of the first `x` integers is \(\frac{x(x-1)}{2}\), so the expected contribution simplifies to:
\[ \text{Expected Contribution} = f \cdot \frac{x}{\binom{n}{2}} + \frac{\frac{x(x-1)}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{f \cdot x + \frac{x(x-1)}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

The expected value over `k` excursions for all pairs is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{\text{all pairs}} \left( f \cdot \frac{x}{\binom{n}{2}} + \frac{\frac{x(x-1)}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

Where `x` is the expected number of times a pair is chosen, which is `k / \binom{n}{2}`.

Thus, the correct calculation should be:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{\text{all pairs}} \left( f \cdot \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} + \frac{\frac{k(k-1)}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \left( \sum_{\text{all pairs}} f \right) \cdot \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} + \left( \sum_{\text{all pairs}} 1 \right) \cdot \frac{\frac{k(k-1)}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}} \]
\[ \text{Expected Value} = a \cdot \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} + m \cdot \frac{\frac{k(k-1)}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

Where `a` is the sum of all initial friendship values and `m` is the number of pairs.

The modular inverse should be calculated as:
\[ c = \text{modular inverse of } \binom{n}{2} \]

Thus, the correct code should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for j in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_value = (a * k * c + m * k * (k - 1) // 2 * c * c) % M
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

#### Conclusion

The provided program contains incorrect logic for calculating the expected value and the modular inverse. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
