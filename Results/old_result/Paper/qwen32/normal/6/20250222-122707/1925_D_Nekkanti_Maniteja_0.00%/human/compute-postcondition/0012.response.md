The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n`, `m` must be greater than 0; `k` is 1000000007; `M` is 1000000007; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`; `s` is 0; `a` is `f + f`; `i` is 2; `u`, `v`, `f` are the integers read from the input.**
