### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the given program and the annotations to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of children.
     - `m`: Number of friend pairs.
     - `k`: Number of excursions.
     - `m` lines of friend pairs with their initial friendship values.

2. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, expressed as `p * q^(-1) % (10^9 + 7)`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value is calculated by considering the probability of each friend pair being chosen and the expected increase in their friendship values over `k` excursions.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program is as follows:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Annotations:
The annotations state:
```python
#State of the program right before the function call: Each test case consists of integers n, m, and k where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. For each of the m pairs of friends, the input specifies two distinct children a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n) and their initial friendship value f_i (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: s = (c^2 * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k) % M
```

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Probability**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is correct for the probability of choosing any specific pair.
   - However, the probability `c` is used incorrectly in the loop that calculates `s`. The loop iterates `k` times, and `c` is multiplied multiple times in a way that does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.

2. **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value should consider the probability of each friend pair being chosen and the expected increase in their friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The current implementation incorrectly multiplies `c` multiple times and adds `a` (the sum of initial friendship values) in a loop that iterates `k` times. This does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Non-Friend Pairs**:
   - The program does not handle the case where there are no friend pairs (`m = 0`) correctly. It should return 0 for such cases, but the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the flawed logic.

4. **Incorrect Use of Modular Inverse**:
   - The modular inverse is used incorrectly in the loop that calculates `s`. The current implementation does not correctly accumulate the expected value using the modular inverse.

#### Corrected Version:
The corrected version of the program should properly calculate the expected value by considering the probability of each friend pair being chosen and the expected increase in their friendship values over `k` excursions.

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        prob = pow(total_pairs, -1, MOD)  # Probability of choosing any specific pair
        
        # Calculate the initial expected value
        initial_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            initial_sum += f
        
        # Calculate the expected increase in friendship values
        expected_increase = 0
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            expected_increase = (expected_increase + i * prob * m) % MOD
        
        # Calculate the final expected value
        final_expected_value = (initial_sum + expected_increase) % MOD
        print(final_expected_value)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The original assessment is accurate, and the program should be corrected as shown above.

### Final: **False**
