In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range specified by the integer input. The loop head only involves the variable `i` and the range function, which depends on the input value. Therefore, the only state we need to adjust is the input value that determines the range of the loop.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will execute `int(input())` times.
2. To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1.
3. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of friendship values are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted such that the input value is at least 1.

State: **`input()` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1**
