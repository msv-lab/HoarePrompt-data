The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the input integer provided to `range(int(input()))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 2. The input integer to `range` determines the upper limit of the loop, but since we are only adjusting the state based on the loop head, we do not need to change `x` or `y`.

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`**
