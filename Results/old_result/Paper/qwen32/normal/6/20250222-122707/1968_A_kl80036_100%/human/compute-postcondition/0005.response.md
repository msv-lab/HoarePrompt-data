The code snippet `x = int(input())` changes the value of `x` to whatever integer is input by the user. The values of `i` and the original value of `y` (which was `x - 1`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, after the code is executed, `x` will have the new input value, and `y` will still be the original value of `x - 1` based on the initial state. However, since `x` is reassigned, `y` is no longer `x - 1` in terms of the current state of `x`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is the original value of `x - 1` based on the initial `x`.**
