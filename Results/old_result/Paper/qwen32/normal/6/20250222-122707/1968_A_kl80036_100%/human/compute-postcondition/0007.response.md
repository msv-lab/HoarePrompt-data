Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement, it is provided in the initial state).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(y)
```

### Analysis:
1. The value of `x` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but it is described as an input integer. This means `x` can be any integer value provided as input.
2. The variable `y` is calculated as `x - 1`. Therefore, the value of `y` will be one less than the value of `x`.

### Output:
Since `x` is an input integer and `y` is calculated as `x - 1`, the output will be the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Output: **y (where y is x - 1 and x is the input integer)**
