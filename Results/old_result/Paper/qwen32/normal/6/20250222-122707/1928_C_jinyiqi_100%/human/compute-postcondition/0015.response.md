To determine the output state after all iterations of the given loop, we need to understand the purpose of the loop. The loop iterates from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` and checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`. If `i` divides `x` without a remainder, both `i` and `x // i` are added to `output1` and `output2` respectively.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and continues until `i > int(x ** 0.5)`.
2. **Condition Check**: For each `i`, it checks if `x % i == 0`.
3. **Appending to Lists**: If the condition is true, `i` is appended to `output1` and `x // i` is appended to `output2`.
4. **Increment**: `i` is incremented by `1` and the process repeats until `i` exceeds `int(x ** 0.5)`.

The loop will execute `int(x ** 0.5)` times in total, and for each iteration where `x % i == 0`, `output1` and `output2` will be updated accordingly.

### Final Output State

After all iterations, `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`, and `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors that are greater than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`.

### Example

For `x = 28`, the loop will execute as follows:
- `i = 1`: `x % 1 == 0`, so `output1 = [1]` and `output2 = [28]`
- `i = 2`: `x % 2 == 0`, so `output1 = [1, 2]` and `output2 = [28, 14]`
- `i = 3`: `x % 3 != 0`, so no changes
- `i = 4`: `x % 4 == 0`, so `output1 = [1, 2, 4]` and `output2 = [28, 14, 7]`
- `i = 5`: `x % 5 != 0`, so no changes

The loop stops here because `i` becomes `5` which is greater than `int(28 ** 0.5) = 5`.

### Conclusion

The final output state is:
- `output1` will contain all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`.
- `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors that are greater than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5)`.

Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` ≤ `int(x ** 0.5)` and `output2` contains the corresponding divisors ≥ `int(x ** 0.5)`.**
