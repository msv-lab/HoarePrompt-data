You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list of all divisors of `x`, sorted such that divisors greater than the square root of `x` appear first, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, which leads to a NameError. Additionally, the logic for determining valid `k` values seems flawed and does not accurately reflect the problem description.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Undefined Function**: The function `func_1` is used but not defined in the given code. This will cause a runtime error.

2. **Logic for Determining Valid `k`**: The logic for determining the valid `k` values is not correctly implemented. The problem requires checking for each `k` whether the position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the described sequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should work correctly:

```python
def count_valid_ks(n, x):
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        period = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_period = (n - 1) % period
        if position_in_period < k - 1:
            if position_in_period + 1 == x:
                count += 1
        else:
            if 2 * k - 2 - position_in_period == x:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_ks(n, x))
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible `k` values from 2 to `n` and checks whether the position `n` corresponds to the number `x` in the described sequence. This ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description.
