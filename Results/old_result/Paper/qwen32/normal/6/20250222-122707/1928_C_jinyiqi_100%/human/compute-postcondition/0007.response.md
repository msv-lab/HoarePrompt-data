The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range parameters `1` and `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. Since the range is determined by `x` and does not change during the loop iterations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has a certain value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

State: **`x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.**
