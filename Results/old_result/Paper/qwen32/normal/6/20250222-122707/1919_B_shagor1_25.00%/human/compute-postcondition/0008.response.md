The code snippet `neg += 1` increments the value of `neg` by 1. Given the initial state, `neg` can either be 0 or 1. After this operation, if `neg` was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if it was initially 1, it becomes 2. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters '+' and '-', `i` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `i`, `neg` is either 1 or 2**.
