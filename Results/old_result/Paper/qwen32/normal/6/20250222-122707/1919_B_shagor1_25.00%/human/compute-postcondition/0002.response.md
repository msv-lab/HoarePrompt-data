Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`. The following line contains the string `s` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters '+' and '-'. The total number of test cases, `t`, is between 1 and 1000. `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string. `neg` is 0.**

Natural Language: The input conditions remain the same, and the variable `neg` has been initialized to 0. No other variables have been affected.
