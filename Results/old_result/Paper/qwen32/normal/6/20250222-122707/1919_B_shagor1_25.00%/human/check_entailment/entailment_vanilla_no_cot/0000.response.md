Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the function `func_1` is incorrect for calculating the minimum penalty. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Logic Explanation**: The program calculates `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`. If `n` is equal to `neg`, it prints `n`. This logic does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty based on the absolute sum of subarrays and their lengths.

2. **Optimal Splitting**: The optimal way to minimize the penalty involves splitting the array in such a way that the absolute sum of each subarray is minimized, and then calculating the penalty for each subarray.

3. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve iterating through the string and keeping track of the running sum. When the running sum returns to zero, it means the subarray from the last zero sum to the current position has a penalty of zero. The correct solution would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the optimal splits.

Given the complexity of the problem, the provided solution is too simplistic and does not correctly implement the required logic to find the minimum penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
