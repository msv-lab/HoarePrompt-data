Let's analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to minimize the penalty for splitting a string `s` consisting of `+` and `-` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

### Key Observations:
- Each `+` contributes +1 to the sum of a subarray.
- Each `-` contributes -1 to the sum of a subarray.
- The penalty for a subarray is minimized when the sum of the subarray is 0, because the absolute value of the sum is 0, and thus the penalty is 0.
- If a subarray cannot have a sum of 0, the penalty is minimized by balancing the number of `+` and `-` as much as possible.

### Strategy to Minimize Penalty:
- The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to create subarrays where the number of `+` and `-` are equal, making the sum of each subarray 0. This results in a penalty of 0 for each such subarray.
- If the number of `+` and `-` are not equal, the remaining characters will form a subarray with a non-zero sum, and the penalty will be the length of this subarray.

### Correct Implementation:
The correct implementation should:
1. Count the number of `+` and `-` in the string.
2. Calculate the difference between the number of `+` and `-`.
3. The minimum penalty will be the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-` because the rest of the characters will form a subarray with a non-zero sum.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
The provided code does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
3. It counts the number of `-` in the string.
4. It calculates the penalty as `n - 2 * neg` if `n != neg`, otherwise `n`.

### Issues in the Code:
- The formula `n - 2 * neg` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. The correct formula should be the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-`.
- The condition `if n != neg` is unnecessary and incorrect. The penalty should always be the absolute difference between the number of `+` and `-`.

### Correct Formula:
- Let `plus` be the number of `+` in the string.
- Let `neg` be the number of `-` in the string.
- The minimum penalty is `abs(plus - neg)`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
