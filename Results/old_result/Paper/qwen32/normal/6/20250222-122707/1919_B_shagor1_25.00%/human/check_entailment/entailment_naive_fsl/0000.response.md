Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The current implementation simply counts the number of '-' characters and calculates a penalty based on that count, which does not align with the described penalty calculation method.

Let's break down why this is incorrect:

1. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The provided code does not calculate the penalty for any subarray; instead, it calculates a value based on the total number of '-' characters.

2. **Optimal Splitting**: The problem requires splitting the array into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The provided code does not attempt to split the array at all; it only considers the entire array and the count of '-' characters.

To illustrate the incorrectness, let's consider an example:

**Input:**
```
1
5
+-++-
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- One optimal way to split the array is into `([1, -1], [1, 1, -1])`.
- The penalty for the first subarray `[1, -1]` is `|1 - 1| * 2 = 0`.
- The penalty for the second subarray `[1, 1, -1]` is `|1 + 1 - 1| * 3 = 3`.
- The total penalty is `0 + 3 = 3`.

However, the provided code would output `5 - 2 * 2 = 1`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for this and many other cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
