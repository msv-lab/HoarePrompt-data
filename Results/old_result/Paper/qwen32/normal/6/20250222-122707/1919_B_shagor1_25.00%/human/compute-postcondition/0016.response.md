Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' and '-' characters. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the number of '-' characters in the string `s`. Specifically, it prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg` (where `neg` is the count of '-' characters), otherwise it prints `n`.**
