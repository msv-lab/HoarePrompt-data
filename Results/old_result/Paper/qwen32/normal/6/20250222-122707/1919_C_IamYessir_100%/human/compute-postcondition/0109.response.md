Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element, and the current element `b[i]` is greater than the previous element `b[i - 1]` plus 1.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
