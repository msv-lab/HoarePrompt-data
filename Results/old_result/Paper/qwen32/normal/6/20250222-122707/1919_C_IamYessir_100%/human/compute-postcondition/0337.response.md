The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is 2 if `a[i]` was greater than `a[i - 1]` (originally 1), otherwise `s` is 1, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is the list of integers obtained from the input, and `cp` is 0.
