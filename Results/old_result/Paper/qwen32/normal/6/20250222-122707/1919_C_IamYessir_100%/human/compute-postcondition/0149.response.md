The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now contain one more element, which is `lit[i]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that is directly modified by this line of code is `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `s`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.

Since `a` is updated by appending `lit[i]`, its previous state (either empty or not empty) is no longer relevant for the final output state. We only need to acknowledge that `a` now includes `lit[i]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list that includes `lit[i]`, `b` is a list (either empty or not empty), `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` was an empty list and is now `lit[i]` or the last element of the updated `a` if `a` was not an empty list, and `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. Additionally, `x` is equal to `y`.**
