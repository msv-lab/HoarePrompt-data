The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The other variables `a`, `b`, and the condition that `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `s` is the count of times an element in `a` is greater than the previous element plus one, and `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`.**
