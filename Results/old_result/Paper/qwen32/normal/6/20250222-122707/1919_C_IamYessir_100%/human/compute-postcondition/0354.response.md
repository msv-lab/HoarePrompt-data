To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `b` is a list of integers.
- `s` is the count of times `b[i] > b[i - 1]` is true for `i` from 1 to `len(b) - 1`.
- `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `lit` is the list of integers obtained from the input.
- `cp` is 0.

The variable `s` is the count of instances where an element in list `b` is greater than the previous element. This is a measure of how many times the sequence in `b` increases as we move from one element to the next.

Since the exact values of the lists `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `s`.

Output: **s (where s is the count of times b[i] > b[i - 1] for i from 1 to len(b) - 1)**
