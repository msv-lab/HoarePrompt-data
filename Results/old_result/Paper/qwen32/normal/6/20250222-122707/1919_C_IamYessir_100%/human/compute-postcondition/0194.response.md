Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of the list `a`. `y` is set to the last element of the list `b`.**

In this output state, the variable `y` has been assigned the value of the last element of the list `b`. All other variables retain their previous states and values as described in the initial state, except for `y` which now holds the last element of `b`.
