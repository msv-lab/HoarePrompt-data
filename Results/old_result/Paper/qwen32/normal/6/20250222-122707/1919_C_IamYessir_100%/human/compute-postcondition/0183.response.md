Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `y` ≥ `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `x`, `b` now includes the element `lit[i]`. `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. If the condition `y` ≥ `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `x` is not met, `b` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` retain their previous values.**
