You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of size n . You will do the following process to
calculate your penalty:

  1. Split array a into two (possibly empty) subsequences^\dagger s and t such that every element of a is either in s or t^\ddagger . 
  2. For an array b of size m , define the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1} . 
  3. The total penalty you will receive is p(s) + p(t) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subsequence of a sequence y if x can be obtained
from y by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

^\ddagger Some valid ways to split array a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (s,t) are
([3,4,1,5],[1]) , ([1,1],[3,4,5]) and ([\,],[3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,4,5],[1]) , ([3,1,4,1],[1,5]) and ([1,3,4],[5,1]) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1\le n\le 2\cdot
10^5 ) — the size of the array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, a possible way to split a is s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3] .
The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3 .

In the second test case, a possible way to split a is s=[8,3,1] and
t=[2,1,7,4,3] . The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 1 =1 .

In the third test case, a possible way to split a is s=[\,] and t=[3,3,3,3,3]
. The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=0 + 0 =0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The program provided is attempting to solve the problem by splitting the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t` and then calculating the penalties `p(s)` and `p(t)`. The goal is to minimize the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

However, the logic for splitting the array into subsequences `s` and `t` does not guarantee an optimal solution. The code seems to be trying to maintain some kind of order in both subsequences, but the conditions used for appending elements to `s` or `t` are not optimal for minimizing the total penalty.

Consider the following points:
1. The program initializes `a` and `b` as empty lists and then iterates through the input list `lit`. It compares the last elements of `a` and `b` (or uses `inf` if the list is empty) to decide where to place the current element.
2. The conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are complex and not clearly optimal. For example, the condition `if x > y` and the subsequent checks do not ensure that the subsequences are being built in a way that minimizes the penalties.
3. The program calculates the penalties for `a` and `b` correctly by iterating through each subsequence and counting the number of times an element is greater than the previous one.
4. However, the way the subsequences are built is not optimal. For example, in the second test case, the program might not split the array in a way that minimizes the total penalty.

Let's consider the second test case: `a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]`. The program might split it into `s = [8, 3, 1]` and `t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 1 = 1`. However, an optimal split could be `s = [2, 3, 4]` and `t = [8, 1, 1, 7, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 0 = 2`, but a better split could be `s = [1, 1, 3, 4]` and `t = [8, 2, 7, 3]` or `s = [1, 1, 3]` and `t = [8, 2, 7, 4, 3]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 0 = 2` or `p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 1 = 3`, but actually the optimal split is `s = [1, 1]` and `t = [8, 2, 3, 7, 4, 3]` or `s = [1, 1]` and `t = [8, 2, 3, 1, 7, 4, 3]` resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 1 = 1`. The program's logic does not guarantee this optimal split.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the minimum possible penalty.
