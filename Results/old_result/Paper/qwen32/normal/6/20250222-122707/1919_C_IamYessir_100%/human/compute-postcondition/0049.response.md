The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. However, the initial state does not mention a list named `a`. It mentions `lit` as a list of integers. Assuming there was a typo in the code snippet and it should be `x = lit[-1]` (accessing the last element of `lit`), the value of `x` will be the last integer in the list `lit`.

Given this assumption, the updated output state will be:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the last element of `lit`.**
