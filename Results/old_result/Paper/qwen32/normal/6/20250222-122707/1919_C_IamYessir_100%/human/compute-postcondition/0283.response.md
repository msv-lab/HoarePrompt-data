Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is updated based on the conditions described; `y` is updated based on the conditions described. If `x > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` if `y >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > x`, and `y` is set to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`. If `x <= y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` if `x < y` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`, or `lit[i]` is appended to `a` if `x >= y`.**
