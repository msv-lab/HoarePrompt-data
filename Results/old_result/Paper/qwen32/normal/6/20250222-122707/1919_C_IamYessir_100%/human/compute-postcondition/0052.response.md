The code snippet provided is `y = b[-1]`, which assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. However, the initial state does not mention a list `b`. Given that `b` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume that `b` is a list that should be defined or provided for the code to run correctly. Since `b` is not part of the initial state, we cannot determine the specific value of `y` after the execution of this line. Therefore, we will assume that `b` is a list with at least one element.

Assuming `b` is a list with at least one element, the value of `y` will be the last element of `b`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `i`, `a`, and `x` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `lit`. `y` is the last element of `b`.**
