The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `a` is not an empty list, `a[-1]` will be the last element of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is not an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a`.**
