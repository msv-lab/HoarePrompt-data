The code snippet assigns the value of the last element of list `b` to the variable `y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only change is the introduction of the variable `y` with the value of the last element of `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is not an empty list, `cp` is 0. If `a` is an empty list, then `x` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. `y` is the last element of `b`.**
