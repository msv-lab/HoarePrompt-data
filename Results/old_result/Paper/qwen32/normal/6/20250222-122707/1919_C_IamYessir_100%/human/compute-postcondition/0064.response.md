Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is an empty list or contains some integers, `x` is set to positive infinity if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `lit`. If `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, then `b` includes the element `lit[i]` from the previous value of `i`. `y` is set to positive infinity if `b` was empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before the append operation. If the condition `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x` is not met, `b` and `y` remain unchanged.**
