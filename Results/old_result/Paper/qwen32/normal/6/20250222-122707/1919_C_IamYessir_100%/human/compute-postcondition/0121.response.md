The code snippet provided updates the `lit` list by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, converting each component to an integer, and then storing these integers in the `lit` list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element.**
