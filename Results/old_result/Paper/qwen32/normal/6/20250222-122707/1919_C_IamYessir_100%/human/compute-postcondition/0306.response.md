Postcondition: **`a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`; `n` is greater than `i`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y` or `x == y`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i] > x` or `b` was empty and `y >= lit[i] > x`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before any potential appending. If `x > y`, `a` remains unchanged, `b` has `lit[i]` appended if `y >= lit[i] > x`, and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`. If `x <= y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `lit[i] > y` or `x >= lit[i]`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended if `y >= lit[i] > x`, and `x` is updated to the last element of `a` if `x != y`.**
