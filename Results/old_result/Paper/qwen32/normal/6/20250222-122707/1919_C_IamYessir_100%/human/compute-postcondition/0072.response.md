The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the value of the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. However, the initial state provided does not include a definition or values for the list `a`. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific value of `x` after the execution of the code. Therefore, we will assume that `a` is a list and proceed with the understanding that `x` will take the value of the last element of `a`.

Given the initial state, the value of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` are not affected by the code snippet. The only change is the introduction of the variable `x` which will hold the value of the last element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the last element of the list `a`.**
