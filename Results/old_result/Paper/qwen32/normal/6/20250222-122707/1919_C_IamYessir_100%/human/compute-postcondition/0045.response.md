Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `cp` is 0. If `x == y`, `a` has a new element `lit[i]` appended to it, and `b` is unchanged. If `x < y`, `a` is updated based on the conditions: if `lit[i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `a` includes `lit[i]`; if `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is not greater than `y` but `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. The conditions `x < y` and `x` is less than `lit[i]` which is less than or equal to `y` hold. If `x` is not less than `y`, no changes are made to `a` or `y`. Additionally, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, and `y` is the last element of `b`. The conditions `x ≤ y` and `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` are maintained.**
