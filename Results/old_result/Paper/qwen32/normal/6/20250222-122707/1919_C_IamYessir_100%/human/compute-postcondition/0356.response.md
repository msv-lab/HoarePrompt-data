Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function returns a value indicating the result of some computation based on the list `a`. The constraints are that `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `n` is between 1 and 2·10^5, and each integer `a_i` in the list `a` is between 1 and `n`. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
