The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means the list `b` will have one additional element, which is `lit[i]`.

Let's update the variables based on the given initial state and the code snippet:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `lit` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `b` will have a new element `lit[i]` appended to it.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `x` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `x`.
- `y` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `y`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of the list `a`, `y` is set to `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of the list `b`, and `b` now contains an additional element `lit[i]`.**
