Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is -1 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b) - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is updated based on the conditions described; `y` is updated based on the conditions described. If `x > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` if `y >= lit[i]` or `lit[i] > x`, and `y` is set to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`. If `x <= y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` if `x < y` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`, or `lit[i]` is appended to `a` if `x >= y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `i` is `len(b)`; `n` is greater than `i`; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y` or `x == y`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i] > x` or `b` was empty and `y >= lit[i] > x`, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` before any potential appending. If `x > y`, `a` remains unchanged, `b` has `lit[i]` appended if `y >= lit[i] > x`, and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`. If `x <= y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `lit[i] > y` or `x >= lit[i]`, `b` has `lit[i]` appended if `y >= lit[i] > x`, and `x` is updated to the last element of `a` if `x != y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` may or may not have `lit[i]` appended; `s` counts how many times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` is still greater than `i`; `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`; `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, it is appended to `b`. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and `x` was initially `float('inf')`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `y` is less than `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` if `a` is not empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
