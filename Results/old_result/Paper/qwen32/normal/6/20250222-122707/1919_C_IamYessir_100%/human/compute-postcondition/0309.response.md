The provided code snippet attempts to assign the last element of list `a` to the variable `x` using `x = a[-1]`. However, if `a` is an empty list, this will raise an `IndexError` because there is no last element to access. Given the initial state, we need to consider both scenarios for `a`: whether it is empty or not.

1. **If `a` is an empty list:**
   - Accessing `a[-1]` will result in an `IndexError`.
   - The code will not execute successfully, and `x` will not be assigned a value.
   - Since an error occurs, the state of other variables remains unchanged.

2. **If `a` is not an empty list:**
   - `x` will be assigned the value of the last element of `a`.
   - The state of `b`, `s`, `i`, and `n` remains unchanged.

Given the task constraints and the requirement to provide an output state, we will consider the scenario where `a` is not an empty list, as the task does not specify error handling.

Output State: **`a` is not an empty list; `b` is a list that may or may not have `lit[i]` appended based on conditions; `s` is 0 if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `s` is the count of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i`; `x` is the last element of `a`.**
