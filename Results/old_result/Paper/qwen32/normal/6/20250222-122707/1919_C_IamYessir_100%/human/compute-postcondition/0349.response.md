Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(a) + 1` elements, `s` is the count of times `a[i] > a[i - 1]` is true for `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus one if `b[i] > b[i - 1]`, `i` is `len(a)`, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is the list of integers obtained from the input, and `cp` is 0.**
