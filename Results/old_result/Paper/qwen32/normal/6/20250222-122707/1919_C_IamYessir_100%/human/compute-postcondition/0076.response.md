Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to positive infinity if the list `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of the list `a`. If the list `b` is empty, `y` is positive infinity; otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`.**
