Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to the last element of the list `a` (previously `x` was positive infinity if `a` was empty, otherwise it was the last element of `a`), `y` is positive infinity if the list `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `lit[i]` > `y`, then `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `a`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `b`.**
