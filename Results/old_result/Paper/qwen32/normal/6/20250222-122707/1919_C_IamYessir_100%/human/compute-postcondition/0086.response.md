The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means the list `b` will now include the element `lit[i]` at the end of it. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `cp`, and `i` remain unchanged, while `x` and `y` retain their previous values since they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to positive infinity if the list `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of the list `a`. If the list `b` was empty, `y` is positive infinity; otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. `b` now includes `lit[i]` as its last element.**
