The code snippet `s = 0` sets the value of `s` to 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `s` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is the list of integers obtained from the input, `cp` is 0.**
