Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is a list (either empty or not empty), `cp` is 0, `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b` and `y >= lit[i] > x`, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list, and `y` is `lit[i]` if `b` was empty or the last element of `b` after the append operation if `b` was not empty. Additionally, `x` is less than `y`, and `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`. If `y >= lit[i] > x`, then `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the last element of the previous `b`. Otherwise, `b`, `s`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
