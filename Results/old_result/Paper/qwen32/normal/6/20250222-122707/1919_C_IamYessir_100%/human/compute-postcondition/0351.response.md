Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least `len(a) + 2` elements, `s` is the count of times `a[i] > a[i - 1]` is true for `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus one if `b[i] > b[i - 1]` plus one, `i` is `len(a) + 1`, `n` is the input integer, `lit` is the list of integers obtained from the input, and `cp` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
