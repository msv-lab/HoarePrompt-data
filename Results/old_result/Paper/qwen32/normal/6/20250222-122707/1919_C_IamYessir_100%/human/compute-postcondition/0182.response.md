The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This changes the state of `b` by adding a new element to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are dependent on the state of `a` and `b` respectively, and since `b` has changed, `y` will now be the last element of `b` if `b` was not empty before, or it will remain `float('inf')` if `b` was empty before and the newly appended element will be the first element in `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer that is incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` now includes the element `lit[i]`, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`**.
