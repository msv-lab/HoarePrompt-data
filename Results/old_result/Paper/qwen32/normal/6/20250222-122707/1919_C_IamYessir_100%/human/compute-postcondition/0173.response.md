The given code snippet appends the `i`-th element of `lit` to the list `b`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `x`, or `y` directly, but it does change the state of `b` and `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `lit` is a list of integers.
- `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on conditions.
- `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`.
- If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is updated to the last element of `b`.

The code modifies `b` by appending `lit[i]` to it. After this operation, `b` will have one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `i` is not incremented in the provided code snippet, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the updated output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list that is modified based on conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` remains the same, `b` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b` which is now `lit[i]`.**
