Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `lit[i]` > `y`, then `a` is a list of integers with the additional element `lit[i]` and `x` is set to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of the list `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the last element of `b`.**
