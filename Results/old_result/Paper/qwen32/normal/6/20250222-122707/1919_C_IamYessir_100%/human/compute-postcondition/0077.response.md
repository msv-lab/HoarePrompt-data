The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` from the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means the list `b` will now have one more element, which is `lit[i]`.

Given the initial state, `t`, `n`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `b`, as an element is appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is set to positive infinity if the list `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is set to the last element of the list `a`. If the list `b` was empty, `y` is positive infinity; otherwise, `y` is the last element of the list `b`. The list `b` now includes an additional element `lit[i]`.**
