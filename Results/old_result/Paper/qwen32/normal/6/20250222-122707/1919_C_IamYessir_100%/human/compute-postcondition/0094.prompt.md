Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `cp` is 0. If `x > y`, then `b` is updated based on the value of `lit[i]`: if `y >= lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is added to `b` and `y` remains unchanged; if `lit[i] > x`, `lit[i]` is added to `b` and `x` remains unchanged; if `x >= lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `b` is empty, `x` is `float('inf')` and `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, and `y` is the last element of `b`. If `x <= y`, then `a` and `y` are updated based on the value of `lit[i]`: if `x == y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a`; if `lit[i] >= x`, `lit[i]` is added to `a`; if `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`; if `y >= lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x` is not less than `y`, no changes are made to `a` or `y`. The conditions `x` and `y` are updated based on the above rules, and `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, and `y` is the last element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` > `y`, the conditions for `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `lit[i]` relative to `x` and `y` as described in the if part. If `x` ≤ `y`, the conditions for `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `lit[i]` relative to `x` and `y` as described in the else part. Specifically, `x` and `y` are updated to reflect the last elements of `lit` and `b` respectively (or set to positive infinity if the respective lists are empty) based on the conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `x` was originally greater than `y`, the following occurs: If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, the list `b` includes an additional element `lit[i]`. Otherwise, if `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, the list `b` includes the element `lit[i]`. If `x` was originally greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, `a` has `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains as the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, or positive infinity if `b` is empty. Otherwise, `x` and `y` retain their original values. If `x` is not greater than `y`, `x` is set to the last element of the list `a` (previously `x` was positive infinity if `a` was empty, otherwise it was the last element of `a`), and `y` is positive infinity if the list `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of the list `b`. If `x` equals `y`, `a` now contains all its previous elements plus `lit[i]`. If `x` is not equal to `y`, for each `lit[i]` in `lit`, if `x` >= `lit[i]`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `a`. If `x` < `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `y`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `a`. If `x` < `lit[i]` and `y` >= `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` > `x`, `lit[i]` is added to the end of the list `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
