The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the `i`-th element of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This action modifies the list `b` by adding a new element to it.

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged except for `b`. The list `b` now includes the element `lit[i]` at the end.

If `b` was previously empty, it now contains one element, `lit[i]`. If `b` was not empty, it now contains all its previous elements plus `lit[i]` as the last element.

The condition `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty or the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty will be updated because `b` is no longer empty. Therefore, `y` will now be equal to `lit[i]`.

The relationship `x > y` and `y >= lit[i]` still holds because `x` is either `float('inf')` (if `a` was empty) or the last element of `a` (if `a` was not empty), and `y` is now `lit[i]`. Since `x` was initially greater than `y`, and `y` is now `lit[i]`, the relationship `x > y` and `y >= lit[i]` is preserved.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, `b` is a list containing all its previous elements plus `lit[i]` as the last element, `cp` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than the previous element, `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list, and `y` is `lit[i]`. Additionally, `x` is greater than `y` and `y` is equal to `lit[i]`.**
