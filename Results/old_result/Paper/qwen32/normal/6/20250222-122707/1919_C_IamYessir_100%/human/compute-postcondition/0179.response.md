The code appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This means that the list `a` will now contain one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since the value of `i` is not used in the calculation of `x` or `y`, they remain unchanged. The variable `s` is not affected by the code snippet provided.

The conditions for `x` and `y` remain the same as before:
- If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`.
- If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is updated to the last element of `b`.

Since `a` now has one more element (`lit[i]`), `x` will be updated to `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list with an additional element `lit[i]`, `b` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is `lit[i]`, `y` remains unchanged.**
