Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` and `b` are lists that are modified based on the conditions, `s` is an integer incremented based on certain conditions, `i` is incremented by 1. If `x > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `x >= lit[i] > y`, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If `x > y` and `lit[i] <= y` or `lit[i] <= x`, no changes are made to `a`, `x`, or `y`. If `x <= y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element if `x < lit[i]`, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` remains unchanged if `x == y` or is updated to the last element of `b` if `x < y` and `lit[i] > y`. If `x < y` and `x < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= y`, `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. If `a` is empty, `x` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `y` is updated to the last element of `b`.**
