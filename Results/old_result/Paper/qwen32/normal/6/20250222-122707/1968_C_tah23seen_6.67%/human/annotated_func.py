#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500 representing the number of elements in the array a, which is one more than the length of arr. The function is called for each test case, with the number of test cases t satisfying 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`; `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.
