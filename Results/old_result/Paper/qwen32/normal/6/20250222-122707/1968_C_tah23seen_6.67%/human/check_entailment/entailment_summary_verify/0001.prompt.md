You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find an array `a` of length `n` such that:
- Each `a_i` is between 1 and \(10^9\).
- For each `i` from 2 to `n`, `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`, where `x` is the input array.

### Program Analysis
The given program reads multiple test cases and for each test case:
1. Reads the length `n` of the array `a`.
2. Reads the array `x` of length `n-1`.
3. Calls `func_1(arr, n)` to compute the array `a`.

Let's analyze the function `func_1(arr, n)`:
1. Initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with zeros.
2. Sets `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`.
3. Iterates through the array `arr` and computes `ans[i + 1]` as `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
4. If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, it increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1] > arr[i + 1]`.
5. Sets `ans[-1]` to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

### Correctness Analysis
Let's verify if the function `func_1` correctly constructs the array `a` based on the conditions provided.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `ans[0]` is greater than `arr[0]` and satisfies `a_2 % a_1 = x_2`.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each `i` from 0 to `n-3`:
     - `ans[i + 1]` is initially set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
     - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, it increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1] > arr[i + 1]`.
   - This ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]` and `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] = arr[i + 1]`.

3. **Final Element**:
   - `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
   - This ensures that `ans[-1] % ans[-2] = arr[-1]`.

### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the first test case from the example:

**Input:**
```
4
2 4 1
```

**Output:**
```
3 5 4 9
```

- `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
- `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 2 + 3 = 5` (since `5 > 2`)
- `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1] = 4 + 5 = 9` (since `9 > 4`)
- `ans[3] = ans[2] + arr[2] = 9 + 1 = 10` (but corrected to `9` as per the output)

Checking the conditions:
- `5 % 3 = 2 = x_2`
- `4 % 5 = 4 = x_3`
- `9 % 4 = 1 = x_4`

The program seems to correctly generate the array `a` for this test case.

### Conclusion
The program correctly computes the array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for the provided test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
