The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` modifies the value of `ans[5]` by adding `ans[4]` to it. Given that `i` is 4, `ans[5]` is initially `arr[4] + 2 * ans[4]`. After the operation, `ans[5]` becomes `arr[4] + 2 * ans[4] + ans[4]`, which simplifies to `arr[4] + 3 * ans[4]`.

The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( x_i \) satisfies \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) and `arr[5]` is `arr[4] + ans[4]`; `n` is an integer such that \( 3 \leq n \leq 500 \); `ans` is a list of integers where `ans[5]` is `arr[4] + 3 * ans[4]`; `i` is 4; `arr[4]` is adjusted such that `arr[5]` is greater than or equal to `ans[5]`.**
