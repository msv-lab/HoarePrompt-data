Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements in `ans` are 0. The current value of `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`.**
