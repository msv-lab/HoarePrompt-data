To determine the final output state, we need to understand how the loop modifies the `ans` list based on the values in `arr`. The loop continues to execute as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Each time the loop runs, it adds `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]`.

From the given output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:
- After 1 iteration: `ans[i + 1]` becomes `arr[i] + 2 * ans[i]`.
- After 2 iterations: `ans[i + 1]` becomes `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]`.
- After 3 iterations: `ans[i + 1]` becomes `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]` and `ans[k + 1]` is `ans[k]`, indicating that the loop stopped because `ans[i + 1]` exceeded `arr[i + 1]`.

This suggests that the loop continues to add `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` becomes greater than `arr[i + 1]`.

Given that the loop stops after the third iteration, it means that after the third addition, `ans[i + 1]` becomes greater than `arr[i + 1]`. Therefore, the final value of `ans[i + 1]` will be `arr[i] + 3 * ans[i]`.

To generalize, if the loop runs `m` times, the final value of `ans[i + 1]` will be `arr[i] + (m + 1) * ans[i]`, where `m` is the number of times the loop runs.

Since the loop stopped after 3 iterations, `m = 3`, and thus the final value of `ans[i + 1]` is `arr[i] + 4 * ans[i]`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list of integers where `ans[i + 1]` is now `arr[i] + 4 * ans[i]`, `i` is `k + 1`, `ans[k + 1]` is `ans[k]`, and `arr[k + 2]` is greater than `ans[k + 2]`.**

In simple terms, after all iterations, the value of `ans[i + 1]` is updated to be the sum of `arr[i]` and four times the previous value of `ans[i]`. The loop stops because `ans[i + 1]` exceeds `arr[i + 1]`.
