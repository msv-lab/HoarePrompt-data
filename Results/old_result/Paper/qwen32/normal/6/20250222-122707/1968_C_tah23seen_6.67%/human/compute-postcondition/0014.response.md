The code snippet assigns the value of `arr[i] + ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, the value at `ans[i + 1]` is now updated to be the sum of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their described properties.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers where `ans[i + 1]` is now `arr[i] + ans[i]`, `i` is `k + 1`**.
