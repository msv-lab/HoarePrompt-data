The code snippet modifies the last element of the list `ans` by setting `ans[-1]` to the sum of `ans[-2]` and the last element of the list `arr`.

Given the initial state, `ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`. The only change in the output state is the value of `ans[-1]`, which is updated to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from `0` to `n-2`, `ans[i + 1]` is the smallest integer greater than `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[i]` and its previous values in `ans`; `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
