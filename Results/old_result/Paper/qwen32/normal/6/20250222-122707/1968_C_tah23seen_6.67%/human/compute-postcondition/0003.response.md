The code snippet updates the `ans` list based on the values of the `arr` list. Specifically, it sets `ans[i + 1]` to be the sum of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. Given the initial state, `ans[0]` is already set to `arr[0] + 1` and the rest of the elements in `ans` are 0. After executing the code snippet, `ans[1]` will be updated to `arr[0] + ans[0]`, which simplifies to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1) = 2 * arr[0] + 1`. The rest of the elements in `ans` remain unchanged as the loop or operation that would update them is not specified to run multiple times in this snippet.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer x_i satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 500, `ans` is a list of integers where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `2 * arr[0] + 1`, and the rest of the elements in `ans` are 0.**
