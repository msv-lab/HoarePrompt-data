### Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can form another rectangle after cutting his original \(a \times b\) rectangle, we need to analyze the possible cuts and resulting configurations.

When Bob cuts the rectangle, he can make a cut parallel to either the side of length \(a\) or the side of length \(b\). This results in two smaller rectangles. For Bob to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles, the combined area of the smaller rectangles must be able to fit into a new rectangle with different dimensions (ignoring rotations).

Let's consider the two possible cuts:

1. **Cut parallel to side \(a\)**: This results in two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) if \(b\) is even. If \(b\) is odd, he cannot make an integer cut.
2. **Cut parallel to side \(b\)**: This results in two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) if \(a\) is even. If \(a\) is odd, he cannot make an integer cut.

For Bob to form a new rectangle, the cut must result in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. This is only possible if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, allowing for an integer cut.

However, the given function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if \(b\) is even. This is not sufficient because Bob could also make a cut parallel to the side of length \(a\) if \(a\) is even.

### Correctness Analysis:

The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if \(b\) is even and returns 'yes' if true, otherwise 'no'. This means it will incorrectly return 'no' for cases where \(a\) is even but \(b\) is odd, even though Bob can still form a new rectangle by cutting parallel to the side of length \(a\).

For example, consider the test case \(a = 4\) and \(b = 3\). The function will return 'no' because \(b\) is odd, but Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and form a new \(3 \times 4\) rectangle.

### Conclusion:

The function is not correct because it does not account for the possibility of cutting parallel to the side of length \(a\).

Correctness: **False**
