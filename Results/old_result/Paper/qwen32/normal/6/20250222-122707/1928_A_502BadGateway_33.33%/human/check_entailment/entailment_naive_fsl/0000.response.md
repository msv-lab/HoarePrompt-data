Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle of size a \times b. The current implementation only checks if `b` is even, which is not the correct logic to solve the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If `a` or `b` is 1, then the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles that can form a different rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, then the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles in such a way that they can form a different rectangle.

The given code only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient. For example, consider the case where `a = 3` and `b = 2`. According to the problem description, Bob can cut the 3 \times 2 rectangle into two 3 \times 1 rectangles and form a 1 \times 6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3 \times 2 rectangle. However, the program would incorrectly output "no" for this case because `b` is not even.

A correct implementation would be:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('Yes' if (a > 1 and b > 1) else 'No')
```

This implementation correctly checks if both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, which is the necessary condition for Bob to be able to form a different rectangle.
