### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from a given rectangle \(a \times b\) by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. The key observation is that a new rectangle can be formed if and only if one of the dimensions of the original rectangle (either \(a\) or \(b\)) is even.

Here's why:
- If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the resulting smaller rectangles after any possible cut will also have at least one odd dimension, and no combination of these smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle with different dimensions.
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles such that one of them has an even dimension, and these smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

The function `func_1` in the provided code checks only if `b` is even. However, the logic should check if either `a` or `b` is even, not just `b`. Therefore, the current implementation is incorrect as it does not consider the case where `a` is even and `b` is odd.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The function should be modified to check if either `a` or `b` is even. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

With this correction, the function will correctly determine if a different rectangle can be formed.
