You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Input

    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.

    #The program returns 'yes' if b is even, otherwise 'no'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
Bob has a rectangle of size `a x b`. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides, and then form another rectangle using these two smaller rectangles. The key points are:
1. The cut must be parallel to one of the sides.
2. The two resulting rectangles can be rotated and moved as needed.
3. Two rectangles that are 90° rotations of each other are considered the same.

From the problem description, we need to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the original `a x b` rectangle using the above rules.

### Observations:
- If `a == b`, then the rectangle is a square. Cutting a square results in two rectangles of size `a x (b/2)`, which can only form the same square when rearranged.
- If `a != b`, then:
  - If `b` is even, we can cut the rectangle into two `a x (b/2)` rectangles. These can be rearranged to form a rectangle of size `(a * 2) x (b/2)`, which is different from the original `a x b` rectangle.
  - If `b` is odd, we can cut the rectangle into an `a x (b-1)/2` rectangle and an `a x 1` rectangle. These cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle with integer sides.

### Conclusion:
- The problem boils down to checking if `b` is even. If `b` is even, Bob can form a different rectangle; otherwise, he cannot.

### Program Analysis:
The given program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b`. It then calls the function `func_1(a, b)` which checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise.

### Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

### Evaluation:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic derived from the problem analysis. It checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if true, and 'no' if false. This matches the requirements of the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
