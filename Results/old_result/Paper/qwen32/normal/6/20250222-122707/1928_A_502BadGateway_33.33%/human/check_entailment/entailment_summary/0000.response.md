Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect. The logic in `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The problem requires checking if the rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled into a different rectangle. This is possible if either `a` or `b` is even, because if one of the dimensions is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of equal area, which can then be rearranged into a different rectangle. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged into a 4x3 rectangle. Therefore, the correct condition should be if either `a` or `b` is even.

Correctness: **False**
