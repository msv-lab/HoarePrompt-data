Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. However, the problem requires checking whether the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle with integer sides. The correct logic should consider whether either dimension can be divided into two parts that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be rearranged into a 3x4 rectangle. This means that the correct condition should be based on whether either `a` or `b` is divisible by 2, not just `b`.

Here is the corrected logic:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This will correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
