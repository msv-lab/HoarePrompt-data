The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes that `t` is greater than 0, and `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. However, these variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print('YES')` statement is executed.
2. The string `'YES'` is output to the console.

Since the `print` statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, there is no need to consider the values of `t`, `n`, or `k` for this particular print statement.

Output: **YES**
