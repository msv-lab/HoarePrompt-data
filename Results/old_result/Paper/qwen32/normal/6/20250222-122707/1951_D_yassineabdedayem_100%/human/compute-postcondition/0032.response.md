The given initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not use these variables. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `t` is greater than 0, and `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
2. The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(1)`.
3. This statement directly outputs the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
