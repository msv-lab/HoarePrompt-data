Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, it has printed either "YES" followed by two integers or "NO" based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` from the input remain unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations (as specified by the initial value of `t`), it will have processed each test case by comparing `n` and `k` and printing the appropriate output ("YES" with two integers or "NO"). The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `k` provided in the input will not be altered by the loop.
