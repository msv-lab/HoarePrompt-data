Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- If `n` equals `k`, no further changes are made to `n` or `k`.
- Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to `k`, the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is determined:
  - If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, that relationship holds.
  - Otherwise, `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.

### Python Code Snippet
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis
The `print` statement in the code snippet outputs the integer `1`. The value `1` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`.

### Output
Based on the analysis, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
