Based on the provided initial state, we know the following:
- `t` is greater than 0, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this specific print operation.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

This statement calculates the value of `n - k + 1` and prints it. The `end=' '` argument specifies that the output should be followed by a space instead of the default newline character.

Since we don't have the specific values of `n` and `k`, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are integers read from the input)**
