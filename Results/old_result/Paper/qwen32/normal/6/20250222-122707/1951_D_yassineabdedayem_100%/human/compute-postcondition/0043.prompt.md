You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. The input consists of multiple test cases, with the first line containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        if n == k:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(1)
        elif n + 2 > k * 2:
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
            print(1)
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, it has printed either "YES" followed by two integers or "NO" based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` from the input remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively. For each test case, the function returns a result indicating whether it is possible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
