The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes conditions related to the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these conditions do not influence the output of the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` and will always output `'YES'`.

Here is the detailed explanation:

- `t` is greater than 0, but it's not used in the `print` statement.
- `n` and `k` are integers read from the input.
- If `n` equals `k`, no further changes are made to `n` or `k`.
- If `n` is not equal to `k`, the relationship between `n + 2` and `k * 2` is determined, but this relationship does not affect the `print` statement.

Since the `print` statement is simply `print('YES')`, it will always output `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **YES**
