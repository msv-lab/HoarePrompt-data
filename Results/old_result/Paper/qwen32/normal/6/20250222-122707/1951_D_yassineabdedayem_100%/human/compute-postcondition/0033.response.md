The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, and `k`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, and `n` and `k` are integers read from the input. However, these variables are not referenced in the provided code snippet.
2. The code snippet only contains `print(1)`, which directly outputs the integer `1`.

Thus, the output of the print statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
