Precondition: **num is a list of test cases, where each test case is represented as a list containing two integers n and m, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The constraints are 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in the list of integers for a test case. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
