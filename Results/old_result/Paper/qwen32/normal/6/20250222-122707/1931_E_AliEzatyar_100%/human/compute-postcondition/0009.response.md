The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which will exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Given the initial state, none of the variables `num`, `counter`, or `i` are directly modified by the `break` statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a list of test cases with at least one element, `counter` is 1 if the current element `num[i]` is '0', otherwise `counter` remains 0 and `num[i]` is not equal to '0', `i` is `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
