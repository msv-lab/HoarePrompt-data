### Reasoning:

The program's goal is to determine a way to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, given that the winning outcome has its bet multiplied by a specific factor `k_i`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of possible outcomes, and a list of multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - It calculates the product `m` of all multipliers for the current test case.

3. **Generating Initial Bets:**
   - It generates a list `c` where each element `c_i` is `m / k_i`. This means that if the i-th outcome wins, the total bet `m` would be exactly covered by the returned amount `k_i * c_i`.

4. **Simplifying the Bets:**
   - It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c` using the `func_1` function.
   - It then divides each element in `c` by this GCD to simplify the bets while maintaining the ratio.

5. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It checks if the sum of the simplified bets is strictly less than `m / hcf`, where `hcf` is the GCD of the list `c`.
   - If the sum of the simplified bets is not strictly less than `m / hcf`, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of bets is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the simplified bets.

### Issues in the Program:

The main issue with the program is in the **feasibility check**. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is incorrect. It should be `if sum(c) >= m / k_i` for each `k_i`, not the overall product `m` divided by the GCD of the list `c`.

The correct feasibility check should be to ensure that for each `i`, the sum of all bets `sum(c)` is strictly less than `m / k_i`. This can be verified by ensuring that `sum(c) < m / min(k)`, where `min(k)` is the smallest multiplier among `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation does not correctly check the feasibility of the bet distribution. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
