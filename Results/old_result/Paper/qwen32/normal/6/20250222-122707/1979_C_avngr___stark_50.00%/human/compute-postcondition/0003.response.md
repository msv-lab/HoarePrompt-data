In the given task, the loop iterates over the elements of the `numbers` list starting from the second element. The loop variable `num` takes the value of each element in the list from `numbers[1]` to the end.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, the second element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes for the first test case, and the next `n` elements are the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).
- `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of `t` and `k_1`.

We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

The loop variable `num` is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted. At the end of the previous iteration, `num` would have taken the value of `numbers[1]` (which is `n`), and in the next iteration, it should take the value of `numbers[2]` (which is `k_1`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be set to the next element in the list, which is `k_1`.

State: **`numbers` is a list where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, the second element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes for the first test case, and the next `n` elements are the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of `t` and `k_1`, `num` is `k_1`**.
