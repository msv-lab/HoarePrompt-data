Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `numbers` where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements for each test case. Each pair consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_i`. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `t` and all the integers `k_i` from all test cases.**
