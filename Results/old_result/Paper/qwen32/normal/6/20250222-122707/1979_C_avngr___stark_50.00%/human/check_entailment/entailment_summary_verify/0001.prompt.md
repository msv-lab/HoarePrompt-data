You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    6 3 2

    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        m = m * k[i]
    c = []
    for i in range(n):
        c.append(int(m / k[i]))
    hcf = func_1(c)
    for i in range(n):
        c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)
    if sum(c) >= m / hcf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')

def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
    return hcf



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `numbers` where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, followed by pairs of elements for each test case. Each pair consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_i`. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `t` and all the integers `k_i` from all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Given the multipliers \( k_i \) for each outcome, we need to find bets \( x_i \) such that:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \forall i \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \min(k_i \cdot x_i) \]

### Program Analysis

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read.
   - For each test case, the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_i \) are read.

2. **Calculating the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**
   - The program calculates the LCM of all \( k_i \) values. This is done by multiplying all \( k_i \) values together, which is stored in the variable `m`.

3. **Generating Initial Bets:**
   - The program generates initial bets \( c_i \) by dividing the LCM `m` by each multiplier \( k_i \). This is stored in the list `c`.

4. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - The program calculates the GCD of all elements in the list `c` using the `func_1` function. This GCD is stored in the variable `hcf`.

5. **Normalizing Bets:**
   - The program normalizes the bets by dividing each element in `c` by the GCD `hcf`.

6. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If the sum is not less, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution is possible.
   - If the sum is less, it prints the normalized bets.

### Correctness Analysis

The program aims to find a distribution of bets that satisfies the condition for all possible winning outcomes. Here are the key points:

- **LCM Calculation:** The LCM of the multipliers is used to ensure that the bets can be distributed in a way that satisfies the condition for all outcomes.
- **Initial Bets:** By dividing the LCM by each multiplier, the program ensures that the bets are proportional to the required condition.
- **Normalization:** Dividing by the GCD helps in reducing the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the condition.

However, the condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect. The correct condition should be checking if the sum of the bets is strictly less than the smallest possible return, which is the minimum of \( k_i \cdot c_i \). The current implementation does not correctly ensure this.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the feasibility of the bets. The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` is not sufficient to ensure that the total bets are strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
