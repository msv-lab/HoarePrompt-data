To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it adheres to the problem requirements and accurately computes the minimum total cost of installing supports for the bridges.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Problem Requirements Recap
- **Grid Representation**: An `n x m` grid where the first and last columns are river banks (depth 0).
- **Bridge Construction**: Build `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
- **Support Installation**:
  - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns.
  - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - Cost to install a support at cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
  - Goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for the `k` bridges.

#### Program Analysis
The program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(row, d)`**:
   - Initializes the first `d` cells of the row with specific costs.
   - Uses a min-heap to efficiently calculate the minimum cost to install supports for the rest of the row, ensuring the distance constraint between supports.
   - Returns the cost of the last cell in the row, representing the total cost of the bridge for that row.

2. **`func_2()`**:
   - Reads input for each test case.
   - Calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - Calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

#### Correctness Check
1. **Cost Calculation for a Single Row**:
   - **Initialization**: The first `d` cells are initialized correctly (`row[0] = 1` and `row[i] = row[i] + 2` for `1 <= i < d`).
   - **Min-Heap Usage**: The min-heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost to install supports for the rest of the row while maintaining the distance constraint.
   - **Final Cost**: The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row, which represents the total cost of the bridge for that row.

2. **Total Cost Calculation for `k` Consecutive Rows**:
   - **Cost Aggregation**: The function calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Minimum Cost**: It finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets and prints it.

#### Annotations Validation
The annotations provide a detailed state description of the program at key points:
- **`func_1`**:
  - Correctly initializes the first `d` cells.
  - Correctly uses a min-heap to calculate the minimum cost for the rest of the row.
  - Correctly returns the final cost of the row.
- **`func_2`**:
  - Correctly reads input for each test case.
  - Correctly calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - Correctly calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
  - Correctly prints the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion
Based on the detailed analysis and validation of the annotations, the program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows while adhering to the constraints.

**Final: True**
