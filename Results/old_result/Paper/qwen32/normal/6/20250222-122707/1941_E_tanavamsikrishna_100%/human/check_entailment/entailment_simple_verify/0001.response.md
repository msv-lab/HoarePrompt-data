### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the problem description, the provided program, the annotations, and the original assessment to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of an `n x m` grid.
- Each row must have supports at the first and last columns.
- Supports must be placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
- The cost to place a support at cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
- We need to minimize the total cost of placing the supports for all `k` bridges.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Objective**: Calculate the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Initializes the first `d` cells of the row with costs.
     - Uses a min-heap to maintain the minimum cost to install supports for the rest of the row.
     - Ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed `d`.
   - **Annotations**:
     - The first `d` cells are initialized correctly.
     - The min-heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost for the rest of the row.
     - The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Objective**: Calculate the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Reads the input for each test case.
     - Calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - Calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
     - Prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Annotations**:
     - The cost for each row is calculated correctly using `func_1`.
     - The total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows is calculated correctly.
     - The minimum total cost is printed.

#### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that `func_1` uses a min-heap to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for a single row while adhering to the constraints.
- It also correctly states that `func_2` calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
- The annotations provided confirm the correctness of the program's behavior at key points.

#### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**: The implementation assumes valid inputs and does not handle edge cases explicitly. For example, if `d` is very large, the program might not behave as expected.
- **Performance**: The program uses a min-heap to efficiently calculate the minimum cost, which is appropriate given the constraints. However, for very large `m`, the performance might be an issue, but it is within the acceptable limits given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows while adhering to the constraints.

**Final: True**
