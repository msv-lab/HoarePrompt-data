The code snippet calculates a list called `costs` by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the 2D list `rows`. The dimensions and properties of `rows` remain unchanged, and the other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` also remain unchanged. The new variable `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are positive integers; `rows` is a 2D list of integers representing the depth of the river cells with dimensions `n` x `m`, where each row starts and ends with 0, and the intermediate values are the integers read from the input; `costs` is a list where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows`.**
