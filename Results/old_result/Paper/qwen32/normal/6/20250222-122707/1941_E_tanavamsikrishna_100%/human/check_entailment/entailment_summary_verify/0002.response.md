### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the function summaries to ensure the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Breakdown

1. **Grid and Bridge Construction**:
   - The river is represented as an `n x m` grid where the first and last columns have depth 0 (river banks).
   - `k` bridges must be built on consecutive rows.
   - Supports must be placed at the first and last columns and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed `d`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost to install a support at cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

#### Program Analysis

The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculate the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Initialize the first `d` cells of the row with costs.
     - Use a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost to install supports for the rest of the row, ensuring the distance between supports does not exceed `d`.
     - Return the cost of the last cell in the row, which represents the total cost of the bridge for that row.
   - **Function Summary**: The function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row with the given constraints.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Read input, calculate costs for each row, and determine the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Implementation**:
     - Read the input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
     - Read the `n` rows of the grid.
     - Calculate the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - Calculate the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
     - Print the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.
   - **Function Summary**: The function calculates and prints the minimum total cost of building bridges over a series of river rows, considering constraints on the number of consecutive rows (`k`) and the maximum distance between supports (`d`).

#### Correctness Check

Let's verify if the program correctly implements the solution:

1. **Cost Calculation for a Single Row**:
   - **Heap Usage**: The use of a min-heap in `func_1` is appropriate for efficiently finding the minimum cost to install supports while maintaining the distance constraint.
   - **Initialization**: The first `d` cells are initialized with costs, and the heap is built from these initial values.
   - **Iteration**: The function iterates through the rest of the row, ensuring that the distance between supports does not exceed `d` by maintaining the heap property.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row, which correctly represents the total cost of the bridge for that row.

2. **Total Cost Calculation for `k` Consecutive Rows**:
   - **Cost Calculation**: The function `func_2` correctly calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - **Total Cost Calculation**: It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of the rows in each set.
   - **Minimum Cost**: Finally, it finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and prints it.

#### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows while adhering to the constraints.
