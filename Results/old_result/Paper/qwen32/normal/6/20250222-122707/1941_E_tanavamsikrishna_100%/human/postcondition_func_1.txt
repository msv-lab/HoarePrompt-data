The function calculates and prints the minimum total cost of building bridges over a series of river rows, considering constraints on the number of consecutive rows (`k`) and the maximum distance between supports (`d`). The input includes the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), the number of consecutive rows for building bridges (`k`), the maximum distance between supports (`d`), and a 2D list (`rows`) representing the depth of the river cells. The function returns the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.
