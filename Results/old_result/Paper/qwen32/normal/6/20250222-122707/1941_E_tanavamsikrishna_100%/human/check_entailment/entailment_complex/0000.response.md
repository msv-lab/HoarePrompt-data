### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
   - This function takes a row of river depths and a distance `d` as input.
   - It initializes the first `d` elements of the row, then uses a min-heap to determine the minimum cost for placing supports in the remaining cells, ensuring that the distance between supports does not exceed `d`.
   - The function returns the cost of placing supports in the last cell of the row.
   - The approach seems valid for calculating the minimum cost for a single row with the given constraints.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles the overall problem for multiple rows.
   - It reads the input parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`), and the grid of river depths (`rows`).
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`, storing these costs in the `costs` list.
   - It then calculates the sum of costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows and stores these sums in `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which represents the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges.
   - This approach correctly handles the requirement to find the minimum cost for `k` consecutive rows.

### Correctness of the Code:

- **Function `func_1(row, d)`**:
  - The function correctly initializes the first `d` elements and uses a min-heap to ensure that the distance between supports does not exceed `d`.
  - The use of a min-heap ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost for each cell in the row, adhering to the constraints.

- **Function `func_2()`**:
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes each row using `func_1`.
  - It calculates the cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum cost, ensuring that the solution meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Both `func_1` and `func_2` work together to find the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges over the river, considering the constraints on the maximum distance between supports.

**Correctness: True**
