To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided information.

The loop condition is:
```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
    pass
```

This loop will continue to pop elements from the `min_heap` and check if the index part of the popped element (`e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. The loop will stop once this condition is no longer met.

From the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- After the 1st iteration, `i` must be at least `d + 2`.
- After the 2nd iteration, `i` must be at least `2d + 1`.
- After the 3rd iteration, `i` must be at least `2d + 1`.

This suggests that the loop will continue to execute as long as the index of the element popped from the heap is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Given that `min_heap` is initialized with elements `[(1, 0), (3, 1), (5, 2), ..., (1 + 2*(d-1), d-1)]`, the indices of these elements are `0, 1, 2, ..., d-1`.

The loop will stop when the index `d-1` (the largest index in the heap) is no longer less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Therefore, the loop will stop when:
\[ d-1 > i - (d + 2) \]
\[ d-1 > i - d - 2 \]
\[ 2d + 1 > i \]
\[ i < 2d + 1 \]

Since the loop stops when `i` is at least `2d + 1`, the loop will execute until `i` reaches `2d + 1`.

At this point, all elements will have been popped from the `min_heap` because the indices of the elements in the heap range from `0` to `d-1`, and the loop condition will no longer be satisfied.

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `row[0]` is 1.
- `row[i]` for `i` in the range [1, d-1] is increased by 2 compared to its initial value.
- `min_heap` will be empty because all elements have been popped.
- `d` is less than `len(row)`.
- `i` will be at least `2d + 1`.

Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` in the range [1, d-1] is increased by 2 compared to its initial value, `min_heap` is `[]`, `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is at least `2d + 1`.**
