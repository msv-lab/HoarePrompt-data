t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, m, commands). Here, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^4, and commands is a tuple itself containing a list of integers a of length n (where 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each a_i) and a string s of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
