Postcondition: **The first element of `y` is now either `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, or `k * a[q1+1] % m` otherwise, while the last element of `y` remains the same as the first element. All other variables retain their initial values except `i` which is `n-3` and `n` which remains the same. If `t[i] == 'R'`, then `q2` is incremented by 1. If `t[i] != 'R'`, then `k` is updated to `k * a[q1+1] % m` and `q1` is decreased by 1.**
