Postcondition: **`t` is an input string, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer from input and must be at least 2, `m` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers from the input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the first and last elements being `k`, `i` is 1. If `t[i]` is 'R', `k` is updated to `(k * a[q2]) % m` and `q2` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `(k * a[q1]) % m` and `q1` is decremented by 1.**
