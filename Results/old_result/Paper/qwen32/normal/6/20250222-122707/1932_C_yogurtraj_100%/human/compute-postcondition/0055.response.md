The value of `k` is updated to be the remainder of the division of `a[l]` by `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is a list of integers from the new input line, `l` is the count of 'L' in the new `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element `y[i]` is the value of `k` after processing the character at index `i` in the new `t`, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is 0, `q2` is 0.**
