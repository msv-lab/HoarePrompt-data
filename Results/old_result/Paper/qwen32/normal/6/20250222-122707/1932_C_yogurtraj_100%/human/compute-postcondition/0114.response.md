The value of `q2` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: The first element of `y` is now `k * a[q2] % m`, while the last element of `y` remains `k * a[q2] % m`. All other variables retain their initial values, `i` is `n-3`, `n` remains the same, and `q2` is incremented by 1.
