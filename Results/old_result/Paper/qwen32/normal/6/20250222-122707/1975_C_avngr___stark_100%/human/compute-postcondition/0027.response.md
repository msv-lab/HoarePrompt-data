The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, so `t` should be greater than or equal to 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `max` is the maximum value of the middle elements of all possible slices of 3 consecutive elements in the array `a`**.

However, since `t` is decremented at the start of each iteration, we need to reflect that in the state:

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `max` is the maximum value of the middle elements of all possible slices of 3 consecutive elements in the array `a`**.
