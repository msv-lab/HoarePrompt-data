The provided Python code snippet sorts the list `temp`. Given the initial state, `temp` contains the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`. After sorting, the order of these elements in `temp` will change based on their values, but the values themselves remain the same. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `max` are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input; `i` is 2; `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`; `max` is updated if the second element of the previous `temp` (before sorting) was greater than `max`; otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
