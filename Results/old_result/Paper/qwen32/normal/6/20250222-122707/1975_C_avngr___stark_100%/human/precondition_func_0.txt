Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is provided at the beginning, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
