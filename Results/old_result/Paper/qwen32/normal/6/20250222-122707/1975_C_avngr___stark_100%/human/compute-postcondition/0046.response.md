The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` updates the value of `temp` to a new slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` and including the next two elements.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input.
- `i` is 2.
- `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` in ascending order.
- `max` is updated if the second element of `temp` (before sorting) was greater than `max`; otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.

After executing `temp = a[i:i + 3]`:
- `temp` is now a list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `max`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input; `i` is 2; `temp` is a list containing the elements `a[2]`, `a[3]`, and `a[4]`; `max` is updated if the second element of the previous `temp` (before sorting) was greater than `max`; otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
