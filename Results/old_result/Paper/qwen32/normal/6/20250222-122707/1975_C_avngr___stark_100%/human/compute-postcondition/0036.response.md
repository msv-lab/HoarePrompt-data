The code snippet sorts the `temp` list, which initially contains the first three elements of the list `a`. After sorting, the elements in `temp` will be in non-decreasing order. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value provided by the user input and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `max` is 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is a sorted list containing the first three elements of `a` in non-decreasing order.**
