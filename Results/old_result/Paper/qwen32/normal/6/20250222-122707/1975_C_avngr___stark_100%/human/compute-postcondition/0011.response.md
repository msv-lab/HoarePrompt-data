The code snippet sorts the list `temp`, which is a slice of the list `a` starting at index `i` and including up to the next 3 elements. This operation modifies the order of elements in `temp` but does not affect the original list `a` or any other variables. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `temp` is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `max` is 0; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` starting at index `i` and including up to the next 3 elements.**
