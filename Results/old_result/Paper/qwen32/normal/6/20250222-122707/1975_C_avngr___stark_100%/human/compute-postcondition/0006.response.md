The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, none of the variables (`t`, `n`, `a`) are modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is the input integer representing the length of the array `a` and the current value of `n` is 2; `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by the input.**
