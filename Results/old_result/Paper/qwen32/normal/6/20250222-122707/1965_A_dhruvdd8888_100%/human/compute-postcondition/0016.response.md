The provided code snippet only assigns the value `True` to the variable `cw`. The values of all other variables (`t`, `N`, `n`, `nums`, `ls`, and `nw`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `True`.**
