### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program and function summaries to determine the correctness of the program in solving the described problem.

#### Problem Description Recap
The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to remove stones from piles. The player who cannot make a move loses. The strategy involves calculating the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

#### Program Analysis

1. **Random Function Call**:
   - `rrr = randint(8888, 88888)` is indeed unnecessary and can be removed. It does not contribute to the logic of the game.

2. **Function `func_1` Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called inside a loop, which is correct for handling multiple test cases. However, the function is defined correctly and is supposed to handle the logic for each test case.

3. **Handling Input**:
   - `nums = set(input().split())` reads the input as a set of strings, which removes duplicates and is not suitable for the problem. The correct approach is to read the input as a list of integers without removing duplicates.
   - `nums = set(input().split())` followed by `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` does not correctly preserve the count of each pile size, which is essential for the game.

4. **Sorting and List Manipulation**:
   - The code sorts the unique values of the piles and then manipulates these values. This approach is incorrect because the game does not involve sorting or manipulating unique values. Instead, it involves calculating the Nim-sum of all pile sizes.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The logic for determining the winner is incorrect. The code uses a loop to determine the winner based on the values in the list, but this logic does not correctly implement the game theory concept of Nim-sum.

#### Correct Approach
The correct approach involves calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Here is the corrected version of the program:
```python
def determine_winner():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile in piles:
            nim_sum ^= pile
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

determine_winner()
```

### Final Evaluation
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the input and does not implement the correct logic to determine the winner based on the Nim-sum.

Final: **False**
