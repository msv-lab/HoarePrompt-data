Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `N` is the input integer representing `t`.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element.
- `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list.
- `nw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`.
- `cw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`. Additionally, `cw` is explicitly set to `False`.

### Print Statement:
```
print('Bob')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement simply prints the string `'Bob'`. The variables `t`, `N`, `n`, `nums`, `ls`, `nw`, and `cw` are mentioned in the initial state, but they do not affect the print statement because the print statement does not reference any of these variables. It directly prints the string `'Bob'`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
