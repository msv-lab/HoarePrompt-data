The code snippet provided is:

```python
ls += nums[i]
```

This line of code increments the variable `ls` by the value of `nums[i]`.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `N` is the input integer representing `t`
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'` and must have at least one element where `nums[i]` is decreased by `ls`
- `i` is `i + 1`

The code modifies `ls` by adding `nums[i]` to it. The values of `t`, `N`, `n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'` and must have at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `ls` is `ls + nums[i]`.**
