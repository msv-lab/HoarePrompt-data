To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the loop head variables: `i`, `nums`, and the range specified in the loop (`len(nums) - 2, 0, -1`). The other variables (`t`, `N`, `ls`, `nw`, `cw`) are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

Given the loop:
```
for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` needs to be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Current State**: `i` is the current index after the previous iteration.
2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1` with a step of `-1`.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1.

Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be one less than its current value for the next iteration.

**State at the end of the previous iteration**: `i` is `i - 1` (as per the provided state).

**State at the start of the next iteration**: `i` should be `i - 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element with at least 2 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, `nw` is `True` if `cw` is `True`, `nw` is `False` if `cw` is `False`, `cw` is `True` if `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` is not 1, and `i` is `i - 2`.**
