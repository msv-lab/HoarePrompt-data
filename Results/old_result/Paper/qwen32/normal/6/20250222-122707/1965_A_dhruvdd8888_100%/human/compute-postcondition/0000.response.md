The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `N`. This input represents the number of test cases, `t`, mentioned in the initial state. The other variables (`n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
