Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element with at least 2 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, `nw` is `False` if the current element `nums[i]` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `True` if `nw` is `False` (i.e., `nums[i]` is 1), `cw` is `True` if `nw` is `True` (i.e., `nums[i]` is not 1), and `i` is `i - 1`.**
