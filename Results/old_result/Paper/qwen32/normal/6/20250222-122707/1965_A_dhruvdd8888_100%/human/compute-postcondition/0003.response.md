The code provided sorts the set of integers `nums` and converts it into a sorted list of integers. The variables `t`, `N`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'`.**
