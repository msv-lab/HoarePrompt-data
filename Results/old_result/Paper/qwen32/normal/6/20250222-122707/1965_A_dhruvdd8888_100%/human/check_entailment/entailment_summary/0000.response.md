Reasoning: 

The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the rules described. The logic used in the function `func_1` does not align with the game's mechanics, which involve removing the same number of stones from each non-empty pile until no stones remain.

Here are some issues with the program:
1. The program uses a set to eliminate duplicate pile sizes, which is not appropriate because the number of piles matters in this game.
2. It sorts the pile sizes and then modifies them in a way that does not reflect the actual game moves.
3. The condition checks within the loop and the final decision logic are not based on the Nim game theory principles that would correctly determine the winner.

The correct approach to solve this problem involves the concept of Nim-sum (XOR sum) from combinatorial game theory. The winner can be determined by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes. If the XOR-sum is zero, the position is losing for the first player (Alice), otherwise, it is winning for the first player (Alice).

Here is the correct logic:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
- Compute the XOR of all pile sizes.
- If the XOR is zero, print "Bob"; otherwise, print "Alice".

The provided program does not implement this logic, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
