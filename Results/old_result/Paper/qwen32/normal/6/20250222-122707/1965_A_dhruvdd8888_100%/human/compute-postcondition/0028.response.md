The code snippet `nw = cw` assigns the value of `cw` to `nw`. The previous values of `nw` and `cw` are not specified directly, but we know the relationship between them: `cw` is the negation of `nw`. After the assignment, `nw` will have the same value as `cw`. Therefore, the new state of `nw` will be the same as the current state of `cw`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element with at least 2 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, `nw` is `True` if `cw` is `True`, `nw` is `False` if `cw` is `False`, `cw` is `True` if `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` is not 1, and `i` is `i - 1`.**
