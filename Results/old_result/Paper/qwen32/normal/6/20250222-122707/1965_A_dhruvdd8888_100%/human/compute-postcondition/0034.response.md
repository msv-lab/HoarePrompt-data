To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `nw` and `cw` evolve.

The loop iterates over the list `nums` from the second-to-last element to the second element (i.e., indices `len(nums) - 2` to `1`). For each element `nums[i]`:
- If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` is set to `not nw`, and `nw` is then set to `cw`.
- If `nums[i]` is not 1, `cw` is set to `True`, and `nw` is then set to `cw`.

Let's analyze the final state of `nw` and `cw` based on this logic:
- Since the loop processes elements from the end of the list towards the beginning, the final value of `nw` and `cw` will depend on the last few elements of the list, particularly the first element processed (i.e., `nums[1]`).

To generalize:
- If `nums[1]` is 1, `cw` will be set to `not nw` (initially `nw` is `True`), so `cw` will be `False`. Then `nw` will be set to `cw`, so `nw` will also be `False`.
- If `nums[1]` is not 1, `cw` will be set to `True`, and then `nw` will be set to `cw`, so both `nw` and `cw` will be `True`.

Thus, the final state of `nw` and `cw` will be determined by the value of `nums[1]`.

**Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a list of differences between consecutive elements starting from the original first element, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list, `nw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, the values of `nw` and `cw` will both be `True` if the second element of `nums` (i.e., `nums[1]`) is not 1, and both will be `False` if `nums[1]` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
