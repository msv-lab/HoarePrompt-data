The code snippet provided is `nums[i] -= ls`. Given that `ls` is 0, this operation will not change the value of `nums[i]` because subtracting 0 from any number leaves it unchanged. Therefore, the list `nums` will remain the same, and no other variables will be affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is the input integer representing `t`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input string with the addition of the string `'0'` and must have at least one element, `ls` is 0**.
