To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the changes to the variables in each iteration and extrapolate these changes to the final state.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is the number of times the loop will execute.
- `index` starts at 1.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `data` is a list of strings from the input.

### Loop Iteration Changes:
1. **First Iteration**:
   - `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS` are read from `data` starting at `index`.
   - `p` and `a` are read from `data` starting at `index + 4`.
   - `index` is incremented by `4 + 2n`.
   - `result` is computed by `func_1` and appended to `results`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS` are read from `data` starting at `index`.
   - `p` and `a` are read from `data` starting at `index + 4`.
   - `index` is incremented by `4 + 2n`.
   - `result` is computed by `func_1` and appended to `results`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS` are read from `data` starting at `index`.
   - `p` and `a` are read from `data` starting at `index + 4`.
   - `index` is incremented by `4 + 2n`.
   - `result` is computed by `func_1` and appended to `results`.

### Generalizing for All Iterations:
- After each iteration, `index` is incremented by `4 + 2n`.
- `t` decrements by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.
- `results` accumulates the `result` from each iteration.

### Final Output State:
- The loop will execute `t` times.
- `index` will be `1 + (4 + 2n) * t` after all iterations.
- `results` will be a list containing `t` results from `func_1`.

### Output State Calculation:
- After `t` iterations, `index` will be `1 + 4t + 2nt`.
- `t` will be 0.
- `results` will contain `t` results.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]` in the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]` in the last iteration, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` in the last iteration, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` in the last iteration, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + (4 + 2n) * t`, `t` is 0, and `results` is a list containing `t` results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `index` will point to the position just after the last set of data processed, `t` will be 0 indicating no more iterations, and `results` will contain the results from each iteration.
