The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. The values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `data`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + 2n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**
