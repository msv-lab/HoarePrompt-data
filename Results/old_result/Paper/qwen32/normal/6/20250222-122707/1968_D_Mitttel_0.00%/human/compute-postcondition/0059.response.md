The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the state. However, the loop will execute based on the `remainder_steps` variable. For the loop to execute one more time, `remainder_steps` must be decremented by 1 since the loop decrements `remainder_steps` in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, here are the adjustments needed:

- `remainder_steps` should be decremented by 1.

All other variables are not in the loop head and thus should not be adjusted.

State: **`start_pos` is an integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`; `score` is the sum of `a[current_pos - 1]` for each `current_pos` visited up to the `k`-th step plus `full_cycles * cycle_score` plus `a[current_pos - 1]`; `current_pos` is `p[current_pos - 1]`; `steps` is `k`; `visited` is a dictionary mapping each visited position to the step at which it was visited; `cycle_start` is not equal to -1; `cycle_length` is greater than 0; `cycle_score` is the sum of `a[cycle_pos - 1]` for each `cycle_pos` in the cycle; `cycle_pos` is the position after `cycle_length` steps within the cycle; `remaining_steps` is greater than 0; `full_cycles` is 0; `remainder_steps` is `remainder_steps - 1`**
