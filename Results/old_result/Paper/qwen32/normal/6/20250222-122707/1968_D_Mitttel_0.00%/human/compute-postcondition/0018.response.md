The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the state of the program. However, the loop's continuation depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`
- `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`
- `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`
- `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`
- `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[5:5 + n]`
- `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `index` is `5 + 2n`
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `results` is a list containing `result`
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`

Since `t` is the only variable that affects the continuation of the loop, we need to decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration to occur.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + 2n`, `t` must be greater than 0 and `t` is decremented by 1, `results` is a list containing `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

To make it clear:
State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + 2n`, `t` is `t - 1` (and must be greater than 0), `results` is a list containing `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**
