The code snippet appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged in value or state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + 2n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

In natural language, the `results` list now contains the `result` value, which is the return value of the function `func_1` with the provided arguments. All other variables retain their initial values or states.
