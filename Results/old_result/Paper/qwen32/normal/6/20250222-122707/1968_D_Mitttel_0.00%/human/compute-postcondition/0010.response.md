The code snippet updates the value of `PS` by assigning it the integer value of `data[index + 3]`. Given that `index` is 1, `PS` is now assigned the integer value of `data[4]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**.
