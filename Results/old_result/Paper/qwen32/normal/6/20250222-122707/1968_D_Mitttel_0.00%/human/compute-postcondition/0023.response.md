Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[5:5 + n]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[index - 4:index - 4 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `5 + 2n + 4`, `t` is `t - 1` (and must be greater than 0), and `results` is a list containing `result`, where `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

In simple terms, the variable `index` has been incremented by 4. All other variables retain their previous values.
