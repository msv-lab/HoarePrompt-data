Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `13 + 6n`, `t` is `t + 1` (and must be greater than 0), and `results` is a list containing the updated `result`, where `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`; `results` now includes the new `result` appended to it.**

Natural Language: The value of `result` is now the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, and this new `result` has been appended to the `results` list. All other variables retain their previous values.
