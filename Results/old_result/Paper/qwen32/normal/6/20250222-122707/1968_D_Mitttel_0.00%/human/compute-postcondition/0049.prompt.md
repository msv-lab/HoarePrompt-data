Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]` in the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]` in the last iteration, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` in the last iteration, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` in the last iteration, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + (4 + 2n) * t`, `t` is 0, and `results` is a list containing `t` results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]` in the last iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]` in the last iteration, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` in the last iteration, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` in the last iteration, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the last iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + (4 + 2n) * t`, `t` is 1, and `results` is a list containing `t` results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]` in the next iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]` in the next iteration, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` in the next iteration, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` in the next iteration, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the next iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the next iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + (4 + 2n) * 2`, `t` is 2, and `results` is a list containing 2 results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration. `result` is the second result in the `results` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]` in the next iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]` in the next iteration, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]` in the next iteration, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]` in the next iteration, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the next iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]` in the next iteration, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `1 + (4 + 2n) * 2`, `t` is 2, and `results` is a list containing at least 3 results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration. `result` is the third result in the `results` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
