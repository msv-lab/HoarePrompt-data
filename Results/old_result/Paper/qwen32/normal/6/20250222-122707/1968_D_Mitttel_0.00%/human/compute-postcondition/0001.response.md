The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which is assigned to the variable `data`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and array a, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing Bodya's and Sasha's starting positions respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each element in p and a is a positive integer. `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
