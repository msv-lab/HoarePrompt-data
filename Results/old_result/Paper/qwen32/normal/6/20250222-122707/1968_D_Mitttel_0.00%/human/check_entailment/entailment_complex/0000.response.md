### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine the winner of a game based on the scores of two players, Bodya and Sasha, after `k` turns. The game involves traversing a permutation `p` and accumulating scores from an array `a`.

- **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function. It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

- **Function `calculate_score`**: This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position. It handles cycles in the permutation efficiently by detecting cycles and computing the score for the remaining steps after the cycle.

- **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`, and uses `func_1` to determine the winner.

### Key Points:

1. **Cycle Detection**: The `calculate_score` function correctly handles cycles in the permutation, which is crucial for efficiently computing the score when `k` is large.

2. **Score Calculation**: The score is calculated by summing the values in the array `a` at the positions determined by traversing the permutation `p`.

3. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases as specified in the input, ensuring that each test case is handled independently.

4. **Correctness of Output**: The program outputs the correct result based on the scores calculated for Bodya and Sasha.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided annotations and the logic described in the functions, the program appears to be correctly implementing the game rules and calculating the correct winner for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
