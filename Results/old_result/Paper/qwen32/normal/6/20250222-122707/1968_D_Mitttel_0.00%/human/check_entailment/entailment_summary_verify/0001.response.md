### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its components to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

#### Key Components of the Program:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles input reading, parsing, and output generation.
   - **Process**: Reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It then calls `func_1` with these values and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
   - **Implementation**: The function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and correctly handles multiple test cases. This part seems correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Determines the winner of the game by comparing the scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - **Process**: Calls `calculate_score` for each player's starting position (`PB` and `PS`) and compares the scores to determine the winner.
   - **Implementation**: The function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores to determine the winner. This part seems correct.

3. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - **Purpose**: Calculates the score for a player starting at a given position.
   - **Process**: Follows the rules of the game, adding the value of `a` at the current position to the score on each turn and moving to the position indicated by the permutation `p` unless the player decides to stay. The function handles cycles in the permutation by detecting when a position has been visited before and calculating the score for the remaining steps, taking into account the cycle length and score.
   - **Implementation**: The function correctly handles cycles in the permutation and calculates the score efficiently. It uses a dictionary `visited` to track positions and their corresponding step numbers to detect cycles. Once a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by leveraging the cycle length and score. This part seems correct.

#### Detailed Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
  - The function `calculate_score` correctly detects cycles by checking if a position has been visited before.
  - Once a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps efficiently by considering the cycle length and score.

- **Score Calculation**:
  - The function adds the value of `a` at the current position to the score on each turn.
  - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by considering the cycle length and score.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles large values of `k` efficiently by detecting cycles and calculating the score for the remaining steps.
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases.

#### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles input parsing, score calculation, and cycle detection efficiently. The function summaries and the implementation details are consistent with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
