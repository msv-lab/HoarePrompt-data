The code snippet assigns the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` to the variable `result`. The variable `result` is already an element in the list `results`. Since the function `func_1` is called and its result is assigned back to `result`, the list `results` will now contain the updated `result`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[index - 4]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 3]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `9 + 4n`, `t` is `t - 1` (and must be greater than 0), and `results` is a list containing the updated `result`, where `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.
