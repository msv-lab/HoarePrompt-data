The code snippet updates the value of `PB` to be the integer value of `data[index + 2]`. Given the initial state, `index` is 1, so `PB` is updated to the integer value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is a positive integer such that 1 <= PS <= n, `p` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of n integers, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**.
