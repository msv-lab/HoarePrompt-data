To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's carefully analyze the given initial state:

1. **Variables and Their Definitions:**
   - `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`: These are integer values derived from specific indices of the `data` list in the last iteration.
   - `p` and `a`: These are lists of integers derived from a slice of the `data` list in the last iteration.
   - `data`: A list of strings.
   - `index`: Calculated as `1 + (4 + 2n) * t`.
   - `t`: An integer value, set to 1 in this case.
   - `results`: A list containing `t` results, where each result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration.

2. **Key Points:**
   - We are interested in the value of `result` when the `print(result)` statement is executed.
   - `result` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state. However, from the context, it seems that `result` refers to the last element added to the `results` list, which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the last iteration.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `t` is 1, there is only one iteration, and `results` contains exactly one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
   - Therefore, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the last (and only) iteration.

Given the information provided, the most precise description of what will be printed is:

Output: **result (where result is the return value of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the last iteration)**
