The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Given the initial state, `a` and `b` can either be `l[x-1]` or `float('inf')`. After the swap, the value that was in `a` will now be in `b`, and the value that was in `b` will now be in `a`.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either `l[x-1]` or `float('inf')` (previously the value of `b`), `b` is either `l[x-1]` or `float('inf')` (previously the value of `a`), `c` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is greater than 0, `x` is `x + 1`.**
