The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the list of integers provided by the input, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 1.**
