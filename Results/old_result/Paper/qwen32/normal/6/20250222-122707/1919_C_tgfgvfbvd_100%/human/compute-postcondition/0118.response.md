Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. Each integer `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The function returns a value for each test case based on the given constraints, but the specific return value is not detailed in the provided information.**
