The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, if `a` was `b`'s previous value and `b` was `a`'s previous value, after the execution, `a` will hold the value that `b` held before and `b` will hold the value that `a` held before. The values of `l`, `c`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is either `l[x]`, `l[x-1]`, or `float('inf')`, `b` is either `l[x]`, `l[x-2]`, or `float('inf')`, `c` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `n` is greater than 0, `x` is `x + 1`**.
