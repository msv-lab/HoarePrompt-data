The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `l`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
