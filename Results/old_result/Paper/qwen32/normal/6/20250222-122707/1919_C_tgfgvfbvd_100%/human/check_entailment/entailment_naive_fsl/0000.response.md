Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into two subsequences. The logic in the program does not correctly handle the optimal splitting strategy to minimize the penalty.

Let's analyze the logic in the provided code:
1. The code initializes `a` and `b` to `float('inf')` and `c` to `0`.
2. It iterates through the list `l` and updates `a` and `b` based on the current element `l[x]`.
3. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, it updates `a` to `l[x]`.
4. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, it updates `b` to `l[x]`.
5. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, it increments the penalty `c` and updates `a` to `l[x]`.

The key issue here is that the program is not actually splitting the array into two subsequences in a way that minimizes the penalty. Instead, it is trying to keep track of two values `a` and `b` and incrementing the penalty when it encounters a value that is greater than both `a` and `b`. This does not guarantee an optimal split.

To minimize the penalty, the optimal strategy would be to split the array such that the number of increasing subsequences in both parts is minimized. The provided code does not implement this strategy correctly.

Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
3
1 3 2
```
Expected Output:
```
1
```
Explanation:
One optimal split is `s = [1, 2]` and `t = [3]`. The penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 1 + 0 = 1`.

However, the provided code will output `0` for this input, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for all potential cases.
