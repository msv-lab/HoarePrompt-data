### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to split the array into two subsequences such that the sum of penalties from both subsequences is minimized. The penalty of a subsequence is defined as the number of indices where an element is less than the next element in the subsequence.

The provided program attempts to achieve this by maintaining two variables, `a` and `b`, which are supposed to represent the smallest and the second smallest elements encountered so far in the array. It iterates through the array and updates these variables accordingly. If an element is greater than both `a` and `b`, it increments a counter `c` which is intended to represent the penalty.

However, the logic in the program is flawed. The core issue is that the program does not correctly split the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty. The logic seems to be trying to count the number of elements that are greater than both the smallest and second smallest elements encountered so far, but this count does not directly translate to the minimum penalty for the optimal split.

For example, consider the test case `8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3`. The correct optimal split could be `[8, 3, 1]` and `[2, 1, 7, 4, 3]` with penalties `0 + 1 = 1`. However, the provided program would not necessarily produce this result.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty for each test case as described in the problem statement. The logic for splitting the array and calculating the penalty is flawed and does not guarantee the optimal solution.
