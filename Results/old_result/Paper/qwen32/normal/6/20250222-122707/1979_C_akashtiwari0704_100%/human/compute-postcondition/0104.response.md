Output State: **`bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`, `t` is an input integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `T` is 2, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where the element at index `bets - 1` and `bets` is `prod // a[bets - 1]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is `sumo + (prod // a[bets - 1]) + (prod // a[bets - 1]) + int(a[i])`, `i` is `bets - 1`**

In simple terms, the value of `sumo` has been updated by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it, where `i` is `bets - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
