The code snippet `prod = lcm(a)` updates the value of `prod` to be the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a new list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is `bets - 1`.**
