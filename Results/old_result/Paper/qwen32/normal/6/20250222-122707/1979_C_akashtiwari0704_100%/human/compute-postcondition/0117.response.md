To determine the output of the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`.
2. `i` is `bets - 1`.
3. `ans` is constructed by concatenating the string representations of elements from the list `a` from index `0` to `bets - 1`, with a space between each element.

### Analysis:
- The variable `bets` is a positive integer, indicating the number of elements from the list `a` that are included in the string `ans`.
- The variable `i` is simply `bets - 1`, which is the last index of the elements considered for constructing `ans`.
- The variable `ans` is constructed by iterating through the list `a` from index `0` to `bets - 1` and concatenating their string representations separated by spaces.

### Given Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is a string formed by concatenating the string representations of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`, separated by spaces.

### Output Description:
Since the specific elements of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `a` and the value of `bets`.

Output: **a[0] a[1] ... a[bets - 1] (where each a[i] is the string representation of the i-th element of the list `a` and `bets` is the number of elements included in the string)**

This description captures the precise structure of the output based on the given initial state.
