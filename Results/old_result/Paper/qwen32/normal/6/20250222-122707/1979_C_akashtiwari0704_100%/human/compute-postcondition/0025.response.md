The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` will add the integer value of `a[i]` to the current value of `sumo`. Given that `i` is 2, the value `a[2]` will be added to `sumo`. 

Initial State: 
- `bets` must be greater than 0
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4
- `T` is 0
- `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`
- `l` is a list with at least one element
- `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`, and `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`
- `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a` before the update
- `sumo` is `a[0] + a[1]`
- `i` is 2

After executing `sumo += int(a[i])`, `sumo` will be updated to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is `prod // a[1]`, and `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a` before the update, `sumo` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2]`, `i` is 2**.
