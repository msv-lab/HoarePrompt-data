The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`bets` is an integer such that `bets > 0`, `i` is 1, `ans` includes the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space.**
