The code snippet updates the value of `g` based on the current value of `g`, `l[i]`, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state, the updated value of `g` is calculated as `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 0, `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` (recalculated), `l` is a list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`**.
