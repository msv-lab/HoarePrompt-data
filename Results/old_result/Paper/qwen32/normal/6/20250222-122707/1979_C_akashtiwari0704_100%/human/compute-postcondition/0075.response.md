The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing string `ans`. This operation affects the variable `ans` by extending its content.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list where each element is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of all updated elements in `a`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `i` is `bets`, `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space appended to its previous value.**

In simpler terms, the variable `ans` has been updated to include the string representation of `a[bets]` followed by a space, while all other variables retain their previous values.
