To determine the new value of `g`, we need to understand the operation `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Here, `gcd(g, l[i])` computes the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[i]`. Given that `g` was initially 1, and `l[i]` is an element from the list `l`, the new value of `g` will be `l[i]` itself because `gcd(1, l[i])` is always 1. Therefore, `g` will be updated to `l[i]`.

The other variables (`bets`, `t`, `T`, `l`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `i`) remain unchanged as per the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 1, `g` is `l[i]`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple of all elements in the list `a` before the update, `sumo` is the sum of all `a[i]` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `i` is 0**.
