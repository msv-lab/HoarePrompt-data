The code appends a new element to the `result` list. This element is determined by the expression `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, where `k` is the next element in the `queries` list. The values of `queries` and `array` remain unchanged, but `result` gains an additional element.

Output State: **`queries` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `result` has an additional element which is `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`, and `k` is the next element in the `queries` list, which is the element following the previously processed `k`.**
