To determine the output of the `print(*result)` statement, let's break down the given information step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **n**: The first positive integer read from the input. It indicates the number of operations.
2. **q**: The second positive integer read from the input. It indicates the number of queries.
3. **operations**: A list of `n` operations read from the input. Each operation could be a specific command or action to be performed.
4. **queries**: A list of integers read from the input. Each query could be a request for information or a value based on the operations.
5. **t**: A variable initialized to 1 (though its role is not explicitly described in the problem, it might be used internally in the `func_1` function).
6. **result**: The value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. This is the core of what we need to determine to answer the question.

### Function `func_1`:
The function `func_1` takes three parameters:
- `n`: The number of operations.
- `operations`: The list of operations.
- `queries`: The list of queries.

The output of `func_1` is stored in the variable `result`.

### Print Statement:
The print statement `print(*result)` uses the unpacking operator `*` to print all elements of the `result` list.

### Determining the Output:
Without the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact numerical values that `result` will hold. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

**Output Description**:
- `result` is the list returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
- The `print(*result)` statement will unpack and print all elements of the `result` list.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the elements of the list `result`, which is the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

**Output: **result (where result is the list returned by func_1(n, operations, queries))**
