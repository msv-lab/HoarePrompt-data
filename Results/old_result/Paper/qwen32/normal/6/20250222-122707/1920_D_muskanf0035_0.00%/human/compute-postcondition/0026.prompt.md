You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer b (either 1 or 2) and an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ n if b=1, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9 if b=2), and queries is a list of integers where each integer k satisfies 1 ≤ k ≤ min(10^18, c) with c being the size of the array after all operations.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: the final list `array` after all operations have been processed.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: - `result` will contain as many elements as there are in `queries`.
    #- Each element in `result` corresponds to an element in `array` selected by the index `(k - 1) % len(array)` where `k` is each element from `queries`.
    #
    #In simple terms, after all iterations, `result` will be a list of elements from `array` selected according to the indices specified by `queries`, with the indices adjusted to wrap around `array` if necessary.
    #
    #Output State:
    return result
    #The program returns `result`, which is a list of elements from `array` selected according to the indices specified by `queries`, with the indices adjusted to wrap around `array` if necessary.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `b` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `x` (with constraints based on the value of `b`); and `queries`, a list of integers representing indices. The function performs a series of operations on an array and returns a list of elements from the array selected according to the indices specified by `queries`, with the indices adjusted to wrap around the array if necessary.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `result`, which is a list of elements from `array` selected according to the indices specified by `queries`, with the indices adjusted to wrap around `array` if necessary.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
