Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the second type of operation, which involves appending multiple copies of the current array to itself. The current implementation of `func_1` only appends the array to itself once when `op_type` is 2, instead of appending `x` copies as required. This will result in incorrect array formations and, consequently, incorrect query results.

Here's a brief explanation of the issue:

- For an operation of type 2, the code should extend the array by repeating the current array `x` times, not just once.
- The current implementation uses `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`, which is equivalent to `array.extend(array)`, appending the array to itself only once.

To fix this, the code should be modified to correctly handle the second type of operation by repeating the array `x` times. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array = array * value  # Corrected line: repeat the array `value` times
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

With this correction, the program should correctly form the array based on the operations and answer the queries accordingly.
