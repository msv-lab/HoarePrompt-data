Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of operations, `operations` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers b (1 or 2) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n for b=1, x ≥ 1 for b=2), and `queries` is a list of q positive integers representing the queries, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
    print(*result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations where each operation is a list containing two integers `b` (1 or 2) and `x` (with `x` constrained by the value of `b`), `queries` is a list of integers read from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input, `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input, `t` is `t - 1`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the first positive integer read from the input, `q` is the second positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input, `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input, `t` is 1, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
