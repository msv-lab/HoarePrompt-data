Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Array Operations:**
   - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the end of the array.
   - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array. This means the array size will increase significantly.

2. **Queries:**
   - For each query `k`, determine the `k`-th element of the final array, where elements are 1-indexed.

### Key Points

- The array size can grow exponentially due to Type 2 operations, which makes it impractical to store the entire array explicitly.
- The problem requires handling up to `10^5` operations and queries across multiple test cases, which implies that the solution must be efficient.

### Analysis of the Provided Program

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Appending Values:**
  - When `op_type == 1`, the program correctly appends `value` to the array.
- **Extending the Array:**
  - When `op_type == 2`, the program attempts to extend the array by appending `x` copies of itself using `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`. However, this is incorrect because it only appends the array once, not `x` times.
- **Query Handling:**
  - The program calculates the `k`-th element using `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This works correctly if the array is built correctly, but due to the incorrect handling of Type 2 operations, the array size and content are incorrect.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input Parsing:**
  - Correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of operations and queries, the operations themselves, and the queries.
- **Result Calculation:**
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not handle Type 2 operations correctly. Specifically, when `op_type == 2`, the program should append `x` copies of the array to itself, but it only appends the array once. This results in an incorrect array size and content, leading to incorrect query results.

### Correctness

Correctness: **False**
