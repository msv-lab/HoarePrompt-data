Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle the operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function incorrectly implements the second type of operation (appending `x` copies of the array to itself).

#### Problem in the Second Operation:
The second type of operation is described as appending `x` copies of the current array to itself. For example, if the current array is `[1, 2]` and the operation is `2 3`, the array should become `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` (3 copies of `[1, 2]` appended to itself).

However, the current implementation of the second operation in `func_1` appends only one copy of the array to itself:
```python
else:
    array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```
This line appends only one copy of the array to itself, not `x` copies.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly implement the second type of operation, we need to append `x` copies of the array to itself. This can be done using a loop or by multiplying the list:
```python
else:
    array *= x
```
or
```python
else:
    array.extend(array * (x - 1))
```

#### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1
1 1
2 3
1 2
1
```
The expected output is `1` because after the first operation, the array is `[1]`. After the second operation, it should be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (3 copies of `[1]`), but the current implementation makes it `[1, 1]`. After the third operation, the array becomes `[1, 1, 2]`. The query asks for the 1st element, which should be `1`.

However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `2` because it only appends one copy of the array, resulting in `[1, 1, 2]` after the second operation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle the second type of operation, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
