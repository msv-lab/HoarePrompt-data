The code snippet provided assigns the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` to the variable `result`. This means that the value of `result` will be whatever `func_1` returns based on the inputs `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.

The other variables (`n`, `q`, `operations`, `queries`, and `t`) remain unchanged by this line of code. The variable `t` was previously mentioned as `t - 1`, but since there is no operation affecting `t` in the given code snippet, it retains its value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer read from the input, `q` is a positive integer read from the input, `operations` is a list of `n` operations read from the input, `queries` is a new list of integers read from the input, `t` is `t - 1`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
