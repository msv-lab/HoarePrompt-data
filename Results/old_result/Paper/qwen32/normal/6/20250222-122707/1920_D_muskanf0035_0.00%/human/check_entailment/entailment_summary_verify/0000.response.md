### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the original assessment to determine if the program correctly implements the problem's requirements.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Operation 1**: Append an integer `x` to the end of array `a`.
2. **Operation 2**: Append `x` copies of the entire array `a` to the end of array `a`.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - It processes a list of operations and queries.
  - For **Operation 1**, it correctly appends the integer `x` to the array `a`.
  - For **Operation 2**, it incorrectly extends the array with only one copy of itself instead of `x` copies.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
else:
    array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
```
This line appends only one copy of the array to itself, not `x` copies.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly handle **Operation 2**, the array should be extended with `x` copies of itself. This can be achieved by:
```python
else:
    array *= x
```
or
```python
else:
    array.extend(array * (x - 1))
```

#### Example Case Analysis:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 1
1 1
2 3
1 2
1
```
- After the first operation, the array is `[1]`.
- According to the problem, after the second operation (`2 3`), the array should be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (3 copies of `[1]`).
- The current implementation results in `[1, 1]` after the second operation, which is incorrect.
- After the third operation (`1 2`), the array becomes `[1, 1, 2]` instead of `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`.
- The query asks for the 1st element, which should be `1` but the current implementation incorrectly outputs `2`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly handle the second type of operation, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
