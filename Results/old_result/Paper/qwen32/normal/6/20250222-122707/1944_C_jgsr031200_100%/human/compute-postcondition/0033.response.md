Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet to determine the output of the `print(i)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements.
- `n` is at least 0.
- `i` is 2.
- The behavior of the internal loop or if statement depends on the value of `freq[i]` and `cou`:
  - If `freq[i]` is 0 or `cou` is 2, the loop or if statement is exited.
  - If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` is incremented by 1.
  - If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `freq[i]`, `n`, `i`, and `cou` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 at the initial state.
- The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i` without any changes to it, as there are no operations in the provided snippet that alter the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `i` is 2, and the `print(i)` statement will output this value.

Output: **2**
