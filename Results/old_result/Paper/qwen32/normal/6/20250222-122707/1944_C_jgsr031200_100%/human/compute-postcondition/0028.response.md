The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `n` is at least 0, and `i` is 2. If `freq[i]` is 0 or `cou` is 2, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` can be either 2 or 1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `freq[i]`, `n`, `i`, and `cou` remain unchanged.**
