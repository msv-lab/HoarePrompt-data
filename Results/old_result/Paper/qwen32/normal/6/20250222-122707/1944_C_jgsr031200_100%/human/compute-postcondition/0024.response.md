Postcondition: **`freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `n` is at least 0, and `i` is 1. If `freq[i]` is 0, `cou` can be either 1 or 0. If `freq[i]` is 1, `cou` can be either 2 or 1. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `freq[i]`, `n`, `i`, and `cou` remain unchanged. If `cou` is 2 and `freq[i]` is either 0 or any value other than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
