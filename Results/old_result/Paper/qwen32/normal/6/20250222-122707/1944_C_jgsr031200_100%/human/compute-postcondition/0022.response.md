Postcondition: **`freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `n` is at least 0, `i` is 1, and `cou` is either 1 or 0. If `freq[i]` is 0, `cou` can be either 1 or 0. If `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program does not change `freq[i]`, `n`, `i`, or `cou`. If `freq[i]` is 1, the program does not change `freq[i]`, `n`, `i`, or `cou`. If `cou` is 2, `freq[i]` can be either 0 or any value other than 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
