Output State: **`freq` is a list where each index `i` from 0 to n (inclusive) holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `arr`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop are complete, the `freq` list will contain the frequency of each integer in the `arr` list. Each position `i` in the `freq` list will tell you how many times the integer `i` was found in `arr`. The rest of the variables, like `arr` and `n`, remain unchanged from their initial states in terms of their definitions and roles.
