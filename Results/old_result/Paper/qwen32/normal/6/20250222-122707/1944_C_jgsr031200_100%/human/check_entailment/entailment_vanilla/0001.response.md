Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from an array `a` and append them to an array `c`, with Alice aiming to maximize the MEX of `c` and Bob aiming to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

### Key Observations:
1. **Alice's Goal**: Maximize MEX.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Minimize MEX.
3. **Game Dynamics**: Both players play optimally, meaning they make the best possible move at each step.

### Strategy:
- **Alice's Optimal Play**: Alice should try to add elements that do not yet exist in `c` to maximize the MEX.
- **Bob's Optimal Play**: Bob should try to block Alice from adding new elements to `c` or to add elements that are already present to minimize the MEX.

### Algorithm:
1. **Count Frequencies**: Count the frequency of each element in the array `a`.
2. **Determine MEX**: Traverse the frequency array to find the smallest index where the frequency is less than 2. This index represents the MEX of the array `c` after all elements are processed.

### Provided Program Analysis:
The provided program follows the above strategy:
- **Frequency Counting**: It counts the frequency of each element in the array using a list `freq`.
- **Determining MEX**: It iterates over the frequency list and finds the first index where the frequency is less than 2.

### Code Review:
Here's a detailed review of the code:

```python
big = 1000000007
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(arr)

def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    cou = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] >= 2:
            continue
        if freq[i] == 1:
            cou += 1
        if cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The code increments `cou` every time it encounters a frequency of 1, which is not necessary to determine the MEX.
   - The loop should stop as soon as it finds the first index with a frequency of 0, as this is the MEX.
   
2. **Redundant Logic**:
   - The condition `if cou == 2` is unnecessary and incorrect for determining the MEX.

### Corrected Logic:
The corrected logic should be:
- Traverse the frequency array.
- The first index with a frequency of 0 is the MEX.

### Corrected Code:
```python
big = 1000000007
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(arr)

def func_1(arr):
    freq = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in arr:
        freq[i] += 1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if freq[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the MEX due to incorrect logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
