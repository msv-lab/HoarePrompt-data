Output State: **`freq` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `n` is at least 0, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `freq`, `n`, `i`, or `cou`. The preconditions regarding the list `freq` and the values of `n`, `i`, and `cou` remain valid as no modifications were made to these variables.
