### Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the final score of a game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to an array `c` (Alice) or simply removing them (Bob). The goal is to find the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed, with both players playing optimally.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Frequency Counting:** The program first counts the frequency of each element in the array `arr` using a list `freq` where `freq[i]` indicates how many times `i` appears in `arr`.
2. **Determining MEX:** The program then iterates through the `freq` list to find the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` (i.e., `freq[i] == 0`) or appears only once (i.e., `freq[i] == 1`). It keeps a count `cou` of elements that appear exactly once. The loop breaks and prints the current index `i` as the MEX when either `cou` reaches 2 (indicating two distinct elements that appear only once) or when an element with `freq[i] == 0` is found.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Frequency Counting:** The frequency counting part of the program is correct. It accurately counts how many times each number from `0` to `n` appears in `arr`.

2. **Determining MEX:** The logic for determining the MEX is also correct. The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that either does not appear in `arr` or appears only once. This is the optimal strategy because:
   - If an integer `i` appears zero times, it is the smallest integer not in `arr`, and thus the MEX.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, it is a candidate for the MEX, and the program keeps track of such candidates using `cou`.
   - The loop breaks as soon as the MEX is found, which is the smallest integer that meets the criteria.

3. **Optimal Play:** The problem specifies that both players play optimally. The program correctly simulates the optimal play by focusing on the frequency of elements and determining the MEX based on the rules of the game. Since the game's outcome depends on the frequency of elements and not on the specific sequence of moves, the program's approach is valid.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, considering the optimal play of both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
