The code snippet initializes a variable `cou` to 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `freq` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`freq` is a list where each index `i` from 0 to n (inclusive) holds the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `arr`; `cou` is 0.**
