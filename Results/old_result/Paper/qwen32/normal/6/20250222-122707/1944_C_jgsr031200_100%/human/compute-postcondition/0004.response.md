Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and `freq[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `freq[i]` has been incremented by 1. The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
