The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are read from the input, so after execution, `x` and `y` will hold the specific integer values read from the input. The other variables (`n`, `t`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 â‰¤ x, y â‰¤ 99`, `result` is an empty list**.
