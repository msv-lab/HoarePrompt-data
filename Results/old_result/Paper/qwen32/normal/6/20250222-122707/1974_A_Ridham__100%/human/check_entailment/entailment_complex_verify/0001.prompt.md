You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 applications. It calculates and prints the minimum number of screens required to accommodate all applications for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown
The task is to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 application icons and `y` number of 2x2 application icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and the 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each.

### Key Points
1. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
2. Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
3. A 5x3 screen has 15 cells.
4. The goal is to minimize the number of screens used.

### Program Analysis

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it:
1. Reads the number of 1x1 (`x`) and 2x2 (`y`) icons.
2. Calculates the total space required by `x` 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`) and `y` 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
3. Determines the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`):
   - If `y` is even, then `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, then `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.
4. Calculates the remaining cells on these screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
5. Checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to place the 1x1 icons:
   - If yes, appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result.
   - If no, calculates the extra space needed and the additional screens required.
6. Appends the total screens required for each test case to the result list.
7. Prints the results.

### Checking the Logic

Let's go through the logic with the example cases:

1. **First Test Case (1 1):**
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 4`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 1`
   - Remaining cells = 15 - 4 = 11
   - Since `space_x` (1) <= remaining cells (11), `screen_require_for_y` (1) is appended to the result.
   - Correct.

2. **Third Test Case (12 4):**
   - `x = 12`, `y = 4`
   - `space_x = 12`, `space_y = 16`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 2`
   - Remaining cells = 30 - 16 = 14
   - Since `space_x` (12) <= remaining cells (14), `screen_require_for_y` (2) is appended to the result.
   - Correct.

3. **Example Test Case (0 9):**
   - `x = 0`, `y = 9`
   - `space_x = 0`, `space_y = 36`
   - `screen_require_for_y = 5`
   - Remaining cells = 75 - 36 = 39
   - Since `space_x` (0) <= remaining cells (39), `screen_require_for_y` (5) is appended to the result.
   - Correct.

The provided program handles the edge cases and general cases correctly by ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used by first placing the larger 2x2 icons and then placing the 1x1 icons in the remaining space.

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
