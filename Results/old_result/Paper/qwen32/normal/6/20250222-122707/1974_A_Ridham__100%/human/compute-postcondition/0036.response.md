The code snippet modifies the value of `extra_screen` based on the value of `extra_space`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given:
- `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`.
- `extra_screen` is then calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0 and `n` is decremented by 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `extra_space` is equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is equal to `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `extra_screen` is recalculated based on the integer division of `extra_space` by 15, plus 1. All other variables retain their previously assigned values.
