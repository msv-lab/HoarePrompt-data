You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 applications. It calculates and prints the minimum number of screens required to accommodate all applications for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Analysis

1. **Grid Size and Icon Placement:**
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which gives a total of 15 cells.
   - 1x1 icons occupy 1 cell each.
   - 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each.

2. **Approach in the Code:**
   - For each test case, the code calculates the total number of cells required for 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
   - It then calculates how many screens are needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons first.
   - If there are remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons, it calculates how many additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.

### Potential Issues to Check:
- **Overlapping Icons:** The code should ensure that icons do not overlap.
- **Correct Placement of 2x2 Icons:** The code should correctly handle the placement of 2x2 icons.
- **Correct Calculation of Remaining Cells:** The code should correctly calculate the number of remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons.
- **Edge Cases:** The code should handle edge cases such as when there are no icons or when there are only 1x1 or only 2x2 icons.

### Code Review

Let's review the code to see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if extra_space % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Checking Edge Cases and Specific Scenarios

1. **No Icons (x=0, y=0):**
   - The code correctly returns 0 screens.

2. **Only 1x1 Icons:**
   - For `x=15, y=0`, the code correctly returns 1 screen.
   - For `x=30, y=0`, the code correctly returns 2 screens.

3. **Only 2x2 Icons:**
   - For `x=0, y=1`, the code correctly returns 1 screen.
   - For `x=0, y=4`, the code correctly returns 2 screens.

4. **Mixed Icons:**
   - For `x=7, y=2`, the code correctly returns 1 screen.
   - For `x=12, y=4`, the code correctly returns 2 screens.
   - For `x=8, y=2`, the code correctly returns 2 screens.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code and checking various scenarios, it seems that the code correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for all given test cases and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**

The code handles all potential cases correctly and ensures that the icons are placed without overlapping, while also calculating the required number of screens accurately.
