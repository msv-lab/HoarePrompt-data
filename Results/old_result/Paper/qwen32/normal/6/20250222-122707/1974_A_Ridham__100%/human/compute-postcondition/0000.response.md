`n` is assigned the value of the integer input, representing the number of test cases. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the integer input representing the number of test cases, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input representing the number of test cases, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`.**
