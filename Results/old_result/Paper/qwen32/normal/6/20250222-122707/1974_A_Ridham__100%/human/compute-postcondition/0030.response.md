The code snippet changes the value of `screen_require_for_y` to `y // 2 + 1`, regardless of whether `y` is even or odd. This means the previous condition for `screen_require_for_y` is no longer valid. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0 and `n` is decremented by 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `x` and `y` are integers read from the input where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99`, `result` is a list, `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `x + y * 4`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, and `total_space` is recalculated as `space_y + space_x`.**
