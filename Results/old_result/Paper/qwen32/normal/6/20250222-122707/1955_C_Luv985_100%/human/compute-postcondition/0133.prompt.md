Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is the first integer value read from the input; `k` is the second integer value read from the input and has been converted to an integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` before any modification; `ans` is 0, 1, or 2. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `mi`, and `r` becomes `n - 2` if `a[r]` (which is `a[n-1]`) is 0, with `l` set to 1 and `ans` set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, and `ans` remains 0 otherwise.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1 and has been decremented by `2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` has been updated to `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` has been updated to `a[r] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged; `l` is 1 (if `l` was 0 before) or 2 (if `l` was 1 before) or 0 (if `a[l]` was not 0) if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the modification if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `mi` remains the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`; `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `a[l]` was 0 and `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `mi * 2 > k` and `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decremented by `mi * 2`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`, and if `a[r]` was 0, `r` is decremented by 1. If `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k` or if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is set to `k % 2`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` after the modification. `l` is adjusted to 1, 2, or 0 based on the conditions described if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains 0 or 1. `r` is adjusted to `n - 1` to ensure `l < r`. If `mi * 2 > k` and `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
