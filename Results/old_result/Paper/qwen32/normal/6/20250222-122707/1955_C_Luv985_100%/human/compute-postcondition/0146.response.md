The code snippet `r = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `r`. This means that `r` now holds the value of `n` decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is the first integer value read from the input; `k` is the second integer value read from the input; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is the number of elements that have been reduced to 0 plus 1 if `l == r` and `k >= a[l]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged; `l` is equal to `r` if the condition `l == r` was true.**
