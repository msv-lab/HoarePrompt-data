Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers, each representing an integer between 1 and 10^9; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been set to `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial values.
