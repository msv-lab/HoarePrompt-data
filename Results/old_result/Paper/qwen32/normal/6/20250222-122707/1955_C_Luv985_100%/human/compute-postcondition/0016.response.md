The code snippet `a[r] -= mi` decreases the value of the last element in the list `a` (at index `r`) by the value of `mi`. Given the initial state, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. Since `a[0]` has already been decreased by `mi`, the new value of `a[r]` will be `a[n-1] - mi`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of `n` integers, with `a[0]` decreased by `mi` and `a[n-1]` decreased by `mi`; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0; `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. Additionally, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
