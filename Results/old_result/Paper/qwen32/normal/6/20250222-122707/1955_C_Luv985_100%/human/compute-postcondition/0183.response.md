Output State: **`t` is either 0 or 1, `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n-1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms, the state remains the same with the exception that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
