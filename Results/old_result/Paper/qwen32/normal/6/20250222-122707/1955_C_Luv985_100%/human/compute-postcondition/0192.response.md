Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input with `a[l]` and `a[r]` reduced by `mi`, `l` and `r` are set based on the condition `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is updated by adding 1 to its previous value if `a[l] == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l] == 0`.**
