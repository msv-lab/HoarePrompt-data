The code snippet `ans = 0` directly assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. This means that any previous value of `ans` is overwritten with 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is the first integer value read from the input; `k` is the second integer value read from the input; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0; `l` is equal to `r` if the condition `l == r` was true.**
