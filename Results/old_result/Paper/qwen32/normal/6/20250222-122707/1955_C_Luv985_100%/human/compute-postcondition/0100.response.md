Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `T` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1; `n` is greater than 1; `k` is at least 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `l` is 0 or 1; `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` before any modification; `ans` is 0, 1, or 2. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are each decreased by `mi`, and `r` becomes `n - 2` if `a[r]` (which is `a[n-1]`) is 0, with `l` set to 1 and `ans` set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, and `ans` remains 0 otherwise.**
