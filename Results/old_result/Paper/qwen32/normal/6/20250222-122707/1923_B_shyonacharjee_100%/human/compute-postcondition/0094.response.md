Output State: **t is 0 such that 0 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; n and k are integers obtained from the second input line; a is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; x is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line; monsters is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple; bullets_used is the sum of the healths of all processed monsters for the last test case; can_survive is False if the total bullets needed for any monster exceeded the allowed limit in the last test case, otherwise True.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `t` will be 0 because all test cases have been processed.
- `n` and `k` will be the values from the last test case processed.
- `a` and `x` will be the lists from the last test case processed.
- `monsters` will be the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the position for the last test case.
- `bullets_used` will be the sum of the health of all monsters processed in the last test case before the loop broke (or all monsters if the loop did not break).
- `can_survive` will be `True` if the total bullets needed never exceeded the maximum bullets available for any monster in the last test case, otherwise it will be `False`.
