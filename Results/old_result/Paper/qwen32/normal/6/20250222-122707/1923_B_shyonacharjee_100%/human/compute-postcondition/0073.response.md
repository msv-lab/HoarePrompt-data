Postcondition: **`t` is \(t-2\) such that \(0 \leq t-2 \leq 3 \times 10^4\); `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second input line; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple and must contain at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is True; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `health`; and `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`.**
