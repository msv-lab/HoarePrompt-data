You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. x is a list of n integers where each element x_i satisfies -n <= x_i <= n, x_i are unique, and x is sorted in strictly increasing order. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: t is 0 such that 0 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; n and k are integers obtained from the second input line; a is a list of integers obtained from the third input line; x is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input line; monsters is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element in each tuple; bullets_used is the sum of the healths of all processed monsters for the last test case; can_survive is False if the total bullets needed for any monster exceeded the allowed limit in the last test case, otherwise True.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n`, an integer `k`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `x` of `n` unique integers sorted in strictly increasing order. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
