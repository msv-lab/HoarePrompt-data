The code snippet increments the variable `bc` by 1. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `bc`, so we can only say that it is increased by 1. The variable `i` is described as the next character in the string `s`, and this state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the next character in the string `s`; `bc` is increased by 1.**
