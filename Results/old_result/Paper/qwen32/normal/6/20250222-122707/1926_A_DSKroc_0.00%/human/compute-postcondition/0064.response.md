Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32; `q` is equal to `t` after the loop completes; for each of the `t` test cases, `ac` and `bc` represent the counts of 'A' and 'B' (or non-'A') characters, respectively, in each string `s` provided by the user. In the current test case, if `ac` is greater than `bc`, then `ac` is greater than `bc`; otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.**
