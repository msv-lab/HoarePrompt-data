Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32; `q` is incremented by 1; `s` is a new string input provided by the user and must have at least one character; `i` is the next character in `s`. If `i` is 'A', then `ac` is 3 and `bc` remains 1 if it was initially 0, otherwise `bc` remains 2. If `i` is not 'A', then `ac` remains 0 and `bc` is 3 if `i` was not 'A' and was initially 0, otherwise `bc` remains 2.**
