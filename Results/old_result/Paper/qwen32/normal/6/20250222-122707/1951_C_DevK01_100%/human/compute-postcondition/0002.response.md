The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `L`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is either 3 Â· 10^5 or less, `m` is between 1 and 10^9, `k` is between 1 and min(nm, 10^9); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
