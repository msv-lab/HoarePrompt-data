The code snippet `w = N.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `N`. This affects the list `N` by reducing its length by one, and it assigns the removed element to the variable `w`.

Given the initial state, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`. After the `pop` operation, `N` will have `q - 1` elements, and `w` will hold the value of the last element that was in `N`.

The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by the operation. In this case, `n` (the length of `N`) will decrease by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is the length of `N` minus 1; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`; `w` is the last element that was in `N`; `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m` equals `k`, otherwise `cost` is updated to `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**
