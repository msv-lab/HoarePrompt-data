To determine what will be printed by the `print(cost)` statement, we need to understand the computation of the `cost` variable based on the given initial state. Let's break down the steps and compute the `cost`:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `t`: An input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `n`: The length of list `N`.
   - `m`: The minimum of the original `m` and `k`.
   - `k`: The third element of list `L`.
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.
   - `L`: A list of integers obtained from new input.
   - `M`: A sorted list of integers obtained from new input.
   - `q`: The smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`.

2. **Calculation of `N` and `cost`:**
   - If `n * m == k`, then:
     - `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.
     - `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `n` is `q - 1`.
     - `N` is the first `q - 1` elements of `M`.
     - `w` is the last element that was in `N`.
     - `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.
     - `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The `cost` variable is calculated based on the above conditions and the values of `m`, `k`, `M`, and `q`.

Given the complexity and the dependency on the specific values of `L`, `M`, and other variables, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `cost` without the specific input values. However, we can describe the `cost` in terms of the provided variables and conditions.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions and values of m, k, M, and q as described above)**
