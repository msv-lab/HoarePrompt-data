The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times, and it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The key variable here is `t`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is either 3 Â· 10^5 or less, `m` is between 1 and 10^9, `k` is between 1 and min(nm, 10^9); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.**
