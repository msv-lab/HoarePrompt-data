The value of `m` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `k`. This change affects the value of `m` but does not change the values of other variables directly. The other variables remain as they were defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0; `n` is the first element of `L`; `m` is the minimum of the original `m` and `k`; `k` is the third element of `L`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input; `q` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m`; `N` is a list containing the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m` equals `k`, otherwise `N` contains the first `q-1` elements of `M` after removing the last element; `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m` equals `k`, otherwise `cost` is updated to `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu` where `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`.**
