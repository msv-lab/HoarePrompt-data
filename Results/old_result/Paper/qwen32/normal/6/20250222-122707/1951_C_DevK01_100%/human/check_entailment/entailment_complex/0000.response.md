Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the prices and then greedily selecting the cheapest days to buy tickets. However, there are several issues with this approach:

1. **Greedy Strategy Misapplication**: The program assumes that buying tickets on the cheapest days first is optimal, but this may not be true due to the price increase rule. If you buy too many tickets on a cheap day, the prices for the subsequent days will increase significantly, which might make a seemingly more expensive day cheaper in the long run.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the price increases that occur after tickets are purchased. The formula for cost does not properly account for the increasing prices over subsequent days.

3. **Handling of Remaining Tickets**: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought is not a multiple of the maximum tickets that can be bought in a day. The logic to handle the remaining tickets is flawed.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the number of tickets to be bought is exactly equal to the number of days multiplied by the maximum tickets per day, or when the number of tickets is less than the maximum tickets per day.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct minimum cost for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
