Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not account for the increasing prices of tickets after each purchase, which is a key aspect of the problem description. The program seems to assume that the prices remain constant after each purchase, which is incorrect.

Let's consider a simple counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- On day 1, purchase 2 tickets for a total cost of 2 * 1 = 2. The prices for subsequent days increase by 2, making them [3, 4, 5].
- On day 2, purchase 1 ticket for a total cost of 1 * 3 = 3.
- Total cost = 2 + 3 = 5.

**Actual Output of the Program:**
The program will not produce the correct output because it does not account for the increasing prices after each purchase.

**Why the Program is Incorrect:**
The program sorts the prices and then attempts to calculate the cost based on a fixed number of tickets per day without considering the increasing prices. This results in incorrect cost calculations for scenarios where the prices change after each purchase.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
