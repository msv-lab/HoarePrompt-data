The given code snippet only reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer `t` is typically used to denote the number of test cases in problems involving multiple test cases. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a` are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer; `n` is either 3 Â· 10^5 or less, `m` is between 1 and 10^9, `k` is between 1 and min(nm, 10^9); `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9.**
