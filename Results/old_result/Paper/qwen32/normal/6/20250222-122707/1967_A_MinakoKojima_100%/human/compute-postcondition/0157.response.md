Postcondition: **`ans_list` contains the previous values of `ans` plus the new value of `ans`. `ans` is updated to `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is `(n - 1) + (k % (i + 1))`. If `i` is 0, `res` is `n - 1`. `k` is 0 if exhausted. `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2. `k` is an input integer. `a` is a sorted list of integers read from input. `i` is either 0 or not 0. `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` and `dif` is not 0. `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`**
