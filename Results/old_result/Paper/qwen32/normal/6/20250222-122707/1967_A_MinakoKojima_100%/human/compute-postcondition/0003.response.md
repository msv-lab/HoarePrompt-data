The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Given that `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, and `t` must be greater than 0, these conditions still hold after the code execution.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
