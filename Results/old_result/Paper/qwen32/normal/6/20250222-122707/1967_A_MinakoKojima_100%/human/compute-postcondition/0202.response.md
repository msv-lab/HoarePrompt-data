The code modifies the value of `ans` by adding to it the result of the expression `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`. The values of `k`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The `ans_list` will include the new value of `ans`. The `res` variable remains unchanged unless `k` is not 0, which is not part of this code snippet.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains all previous values of `ans` plus the final value of `ans`; `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`; `k` is 0 or not 0; `n` is unchanged; `a` is unchanged; `res` is unchanged.**
