The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `dif` are not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, and `res` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is decreased by 1.**
