The code snippet calculates the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `dif` will be the difference between these two consecutive elements.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is: `t` remains greater than 0, `n` remains greater than 1, `a` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` still contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `dif` has been calculated as the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
