Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`**

Natural Language: The value of `k` is updated by subtracting the product of `dif` and `(i + 1)` from its previous value. All other variables retain their initial states, with `i` having been incremented by 1, `n` remaining as an input integer that is at least 2, `dif` being the difference between `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]`, and `ans` being the sum of its previous value and `dif`.
