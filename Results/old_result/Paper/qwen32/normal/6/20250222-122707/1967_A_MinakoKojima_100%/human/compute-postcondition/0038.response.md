Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1, `k`, `ans` is `ans + k // 2`, and `res` is updated to `res + k % 2`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. Since the else part is not present, these conditions apply unconditionally.**
