The code snippet `res -= 1` decrements the value of the variable `res` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `dif`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `res` is now 1 less than its previous value.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is decreased by 1.**
