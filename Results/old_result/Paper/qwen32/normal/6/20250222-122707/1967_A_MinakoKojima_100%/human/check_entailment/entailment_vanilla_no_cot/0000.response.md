Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum score as described in the problem statement. The logic for distributing the `k` new cards to maximize the score of permutations in the rearranged array is flawed. Here are some issues:

1. **Logic for Distributing Cards**: The program attempts to distribute the `k` new cards by increasing the count of the smallest card types first, but the logic for how many cards to add and how to update the score is incorrect. The score is not properly calculated based on the number of permutations of length `n` that can be formed after adding the new cards.

2. **Score Calculation**: The score is supposed to be the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` which are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The current implementation does not correctly account for this. The score calculation formula `(ans - 1) * (n - 1) + ans + res` is not derived from the correct logic for counting such permutations.

3. **Handling of Remaining Coins**: The program attempts to handle remaining coins after distributing them to make all card counts equal, but the logic for this is also incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to use a different approach, such as using a priority queue (heap) to always increase the count of the least frequent card type until all card counts are equal or until `k` coins are exhausted. Then, the score can be calculated based on the number of possible permutations of length `n` that can be formed from the final counts of the cards.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Use a min-heap to always get the smallest count
        heapq.heapify(a)
        total = sum(a)
        
        # Increase the smallest counts until we run out of coins or all counts are equal
        while k > 0 and a[0] < total // n:
            needed = (total // n) - a[0]
            if k >= needed * n:
                k -= needed * n
                for _ in range(n):
                    heapq.heappush(a, heapq.heappop(a) + needed)
            else:
                increment = k // n
                remainder = k % n
                for _ in range(n):
                    heapq.heappush(a, heapq.heappop(a) + increment)
                for _ in range(remainder):
                    heapq.heappush(a, heapq.heappop(a) + 1)
                k = 0
        
        # Calculate the score
        a.sort()
        ans = 0
        if a[0] >= n:
            ans = total - n + 1
        else:
            ans = (a[0] - 1) * n + 1
        
        ans_list.append(ans)
    
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)

func()
```

This corrected program uses a min-heap to efficiently distribute the new cards and then calculates the score correctly.
