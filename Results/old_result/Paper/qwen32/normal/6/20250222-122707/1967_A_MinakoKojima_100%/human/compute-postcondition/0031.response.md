Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1, `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain as per the conditions described in the precondition; `res` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language: The value of `res` has been decreased by 1. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `dif`, `i`, `k`, and `ans`) remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
