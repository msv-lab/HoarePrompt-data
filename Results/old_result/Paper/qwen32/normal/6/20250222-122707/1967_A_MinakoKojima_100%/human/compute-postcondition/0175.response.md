Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is updated to `ans + k // (i + 1)`. Additionally, if `i` is not 0, `res` is updated to `res + k % (i + 1)`. `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `k` has been set to 0, while all other variables retain their previous definitions and constraints.
