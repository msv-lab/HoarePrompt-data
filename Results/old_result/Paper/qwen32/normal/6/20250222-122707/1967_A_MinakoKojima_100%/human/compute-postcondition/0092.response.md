Postcondition: **t is greater than 0, n is greater than 1, a is the newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, ans_list contains the previous value of ans appended to it, dif is a[i + 1] - a[i] and is not 0. If k >= dif * (i + 1), then k is updated to k - dif * (i + 1), ans is updated to the first element of a plus dif, and res is updated to n - 2. Otherwise, k is set to 0, ans remains the first element of a, and if i is not 0, res remains n - 1; if i is 0, res remains n - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
