Output State: **`i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`**.

In simpler terms, the value of `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `dif`, and `ans`) retain their previous values and conditions.
