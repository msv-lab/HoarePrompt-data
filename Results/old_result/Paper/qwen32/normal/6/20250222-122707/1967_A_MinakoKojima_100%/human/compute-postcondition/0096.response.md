Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is not 0, `k`, `ans`, and `res` are updated based on the condition `k >= dif * (i + 1)`. Specifically, if `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is updated to `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is updated to the first element of `a` plus `dif`, and `res` is updated to `n - 2`. If `k < dif * (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, `ans` remains the first element of `a`, and `res` remains `n - 1` unless `i` is 0, in which case the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2` indicating that `a[i + 1]` is equal to `a[i]`.**
