The `break` statement in the provided code snippet will terminate the loop or block it is in, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `dif`, `res`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1. If `k >= dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif` and `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)` and if `i` is not 0, `res` is further increased by `k % (i + 1)`. `k` is 0 after the else part, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
