Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `k` was originally 0, then `k` remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `ans`, `res`, and `dif` remain as per the initial conditions described in the precondition.**
