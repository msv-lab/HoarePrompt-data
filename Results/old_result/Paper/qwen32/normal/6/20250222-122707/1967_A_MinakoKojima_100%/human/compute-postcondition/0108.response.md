Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `i` is `i + 1`, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 and `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`. If `i` is not 0, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`. `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans_list`, `i`, and `dif` remain as they were before the `break` statement. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `k` remains 0.
