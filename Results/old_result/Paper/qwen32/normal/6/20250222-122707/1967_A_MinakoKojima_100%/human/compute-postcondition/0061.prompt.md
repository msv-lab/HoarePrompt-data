Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input; `ans` is the smallest element in the list `a`; `res` is `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`, and `i` remains 0. If `dif` is not equal to 0, then if `k` is 0, `k` remains 0, `ans` is the smallest element in the list `a`, and `res` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, the values of `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain as per the initial conditions described in the precondition. If `dif` equals 0, then `res` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the conditions, and `res` is updated based on the conditions. If `dif` is not 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `i` is 2. If `dif` is not 0, the behavior depends on the value of `k`: if `k` is 0, then `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is decreased by `dif * (i + 1)`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, and `res` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `k` is set to 0, `ans` is increased by `k // 3`, and `res` remains unchanged. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
