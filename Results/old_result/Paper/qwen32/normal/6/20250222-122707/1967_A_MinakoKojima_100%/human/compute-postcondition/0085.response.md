Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is as per the new input, `a` is the newly input list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the first element of `a`, `ans_list` contains the previous value of `ans` appended to it, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]` and `dif` is not 0, indicating that `a[i + 1]` is not equal to `a[i]`. `res` is `n - 1`. Additionally, `k` is less than `dif * (i + 1)`**
