Given the initial state, `ans_list` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and `a` is defined as the second element in `ans_list`. The task is to determine what will be printed when the `print(a)` statement is executed.

Since `a` is explicitly defined as the second element in `ans_list`, the output will be the value of that second element. However, the exact value of `a` cannot be determined without knowing the specific contents of `ans_list`. Therefore, we describe `a` as the second element of `ans_list`.

Output: **a (where a is the second element in the ans_list)**
