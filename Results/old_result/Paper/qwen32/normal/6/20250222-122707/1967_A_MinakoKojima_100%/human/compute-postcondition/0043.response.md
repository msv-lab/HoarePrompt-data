Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the conditions, and `res` is updated based on the conditions. If the if part is executed, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the else part were to exist and execute, `k` would become 0, `ans` would be updated to `ans + k // 2`, `res` would be updated to `res + k % 2`, and if `dif` is 0, `res` would be decreased by 1. However, since there is no else part, only the if part's effects apply.**
