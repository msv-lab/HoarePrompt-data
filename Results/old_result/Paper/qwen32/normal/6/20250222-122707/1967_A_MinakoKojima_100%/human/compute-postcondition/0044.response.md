Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans` is updated based on the conditions, and `res` is updated based on the conditions. If `dif` is not 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1.**
