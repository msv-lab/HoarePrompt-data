The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`, which means the loop will execute based on the value of `t` (since `t` is described as "an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4" and no other variable in the loop head is mentioned).

Since the loop head does not involve any variables that we need to adjust (like `a`, `s`, `x`, `y`, or `z`), the only thing we need to ensure is that the loop can still execute. This means `t` should be decremented by 1 each time the loop runs, as the loop will execute `t` times.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be decremented by 1 to reflect the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` must be an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the input string; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`; `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.**
