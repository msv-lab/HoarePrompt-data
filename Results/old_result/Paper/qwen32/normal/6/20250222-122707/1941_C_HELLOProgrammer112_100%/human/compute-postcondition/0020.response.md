Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `a` is a new input integer. Again, `a` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
- `s` is a newly input string.
- `x` is the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`.
- `y` is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`.
- `z` is the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(x + y - z)
```

### Explanation:
The print statement will output the result of the expression `x + y - z`. 
- `x` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`.
- `y` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`.
- `z` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`.

The expression `x + y - z` accounts for the overlap where 'mapie' contains both 'map' and 'pie'. By subtracting `z`, we correct for the double counting of 'mapie' as both 'map' and 'pie'.

### Output:
Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `x + y - z`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string `s`, y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string `s`, and z is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the string `s`)**
