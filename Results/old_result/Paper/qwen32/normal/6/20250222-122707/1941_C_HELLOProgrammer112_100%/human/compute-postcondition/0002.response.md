The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input, which is a string. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the input string.

Output State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the input string.**
