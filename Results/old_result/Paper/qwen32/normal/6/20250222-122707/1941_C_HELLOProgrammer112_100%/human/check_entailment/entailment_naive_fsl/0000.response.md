Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The current implementation simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracts the occurrences of the overlapping substring "mapie". This approach does not account for the actual characters that need to be removed to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
11
pppiepieeee
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
To make the string "pppiepieeee" beautiful, we can remove the 'p' at index 3 and the 'i' at index 7, resulting in "pppieeeee", which does not contain "map" or "pie". However, the given program would output 3 because it counts the occurrences of "pie" (3 times) and does not correctly account for the minimum deletions required.

Another example:
Input:
```
1
9
mappppie
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Explanation:
To make the string "mappppie" beautiful, we can remove the 'm' at index 0 and the 'p' at index 3, resulting in "appppie", which still contains "pie". We need to remove one more 'p' to get "apppiee" and then one more 'i' to get "appppee", which does not contain "map" or "pie". The given program would output 3 because it counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and does not correctly account for the minimum deletions required.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the problem requirements correctly for all potential cases.
