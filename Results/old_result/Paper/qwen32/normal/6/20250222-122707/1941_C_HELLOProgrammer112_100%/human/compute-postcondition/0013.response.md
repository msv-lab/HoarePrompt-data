To determine what will be printed by the `print(x + y - z)` statement, let's break down the variables involved:

- `x` is the number of times the substring `'map'` appears in the string `s`.
- `y` is the number of times the substring `'pie'` appears in the string `s`.
- `z` is the number of times the substring `'mapie'` appears in the string `s`.

The expression `x + y - z` calculates the total occurrences of `'map'` and `'pie'` in the string `s`, but subtracts the occurrences of `'mapie'` to avoid double-counting.

Let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If `'mapie'` appears in the string, it contains both `'map'` and `'pie'`. Therefore, when counting `'map'` and `'pie'`, we need to subtract the occurrences of `'mapie'` to get the correct count of unique occurrences of `'map'` and `'pie'`.
- If `'mapie'` does not appear in the string, then `z` will be 0, and the expression simplifies to `x + y`.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `x`, `y`, or `z`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the print statement's output as follows:

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in the string s, y is the number of times 'pie' appears in the string s, and z is the number of times 'mapie' appears in the string s)**
