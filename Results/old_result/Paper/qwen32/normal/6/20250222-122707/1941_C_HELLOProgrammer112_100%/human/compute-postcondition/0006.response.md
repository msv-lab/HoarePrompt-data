To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
   - `a` is an input integer. This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it as well.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `x` is the number of times the substring 'map' appears in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in `s`.
   - `z` is the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in `s`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(x + y - z)`.
   - `x` counts the occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` counts the occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
   - `z` counts the occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`.

3. **Explanation**:
   - The expression `x + y - z` calculates the total count of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`, but subtracts the count of 'mapie' to avoid double-counting the overlapping substring 'mapie'.

4. **Output**:
   - The output will be the result of the expression `x + y - z`, which is the net count of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s` after accounting for any overlaps of 'mapie'.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `x`, `y`, and `z`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated result of `x + y - z`.

Output: **x + y - z (where x is the number of times 'map' appears in s, y is the number of times 'pie' appears in s, and z is the number of times 'mapie' appears in s)**
