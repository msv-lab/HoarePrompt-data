The code snippet assigns a new integer value to the variable `a` from the input. The values of `t`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1; `a` is the input integer; `s` is the input string; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`; `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.**
