The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state specifies that the first input `t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. However, the variable `t` is not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `a` is assigned the value of the integer input.

Output State: **The first input `t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer.**
