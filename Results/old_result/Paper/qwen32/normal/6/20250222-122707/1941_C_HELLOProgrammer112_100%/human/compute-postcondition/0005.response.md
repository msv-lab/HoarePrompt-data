The code snippet assigns the variable `z` the value of the number of times the substring 'mapie' appears in the string `s`. The variables `t`, `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the input string; `x` is the number of times 'map' appears in `s`; `y` is the number of times 'pie' appears in `s`; `z` is the number of times 'mapie' appears in `s`.**
