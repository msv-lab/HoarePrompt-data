Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `l` is the binary string representation of `k`, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of (`p - 1`). If `n` is not 0 or `m` is not even, `i` is incremented by 1. If `n == 0 and m % 2 == 0`, no additional changes are made.**
