Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are two integers read from the input.
- `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m` (`k = abs(n - m)`).
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i += 1`).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2)
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print(2)`. This statement directly prints the integer `2` to the output. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i` do not influence the output of this `print` statement because it is explicitly printing the number `2`.

### Output:
The output of the `print` statement is simply the number `2`.

Output: **2**
