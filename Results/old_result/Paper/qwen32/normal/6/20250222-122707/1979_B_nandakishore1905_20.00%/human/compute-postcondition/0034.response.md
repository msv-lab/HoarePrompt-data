The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `n` and `m` to the variable `k`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state, but the code does not affect `i` further.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are the two integers read from the input, `k` is `abs(n - m)`, `i` is incremented by 1**.
