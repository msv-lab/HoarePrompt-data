The code snippet calculates the length of the binary string representation of the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `p`. Therefore, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k`, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`.**
