Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k`, `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of (`p - 1`).**

In simple terms, the value of `q` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of (`p - 1`), where `p` is the length of the binary representation of the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. All other variables retain their initial values.
