Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is now the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
