Given the initial state provided, let's break down the values and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is 0.
- `m` is the second integer read from the input, and it is odd.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, which simplifies to `m` itself since `n` is 0.
- `k` is not a power of 2.

The print statement in the code is:
```python
print(1)
```

The print statement is independent of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1**
