Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `m` is the second integer read from the input, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, and it is not the case that `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, and it is not the case that `n` is 0 and `m` is even**
