The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1 and for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 1.

State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 1, `a` is 1, `s` is 2, `i` is 1**
