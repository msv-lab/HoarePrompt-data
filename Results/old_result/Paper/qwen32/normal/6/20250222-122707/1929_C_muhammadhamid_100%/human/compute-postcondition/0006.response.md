The code snippet provided modifies the variable `s` based on its current value and the value of `k`. The other variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. Let's calculate the new value of `s`.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k` is the first integer from the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0.
- `a` is the third integer from the input.
- `s` is `2 + 1 // (k - 1)`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the given code snippet, it is mentioned in the initial state).

The code snippet is:
```python
s += s // (k - 1) + 1
```

First, let's simplify the initial value of `s`:
- `s = 2 + 1 // (k - 1)`

The expression `1 // (k - 1)` will be `1` if `k` is `2` (since `1 // 1 = 1`), and `0` if `k` is greater than `2` (since `1 // n = 0` for `n > 1`). Therefore:
- If `k` is `2`, `s = 2 + 1 = 3`.
- If `k` is greater than `2`, `s = 2 + 0 = 2`.

Now, let's calculate the new value of `s` after the code snippet is executed:
- If `s` is `3` (when `k` is `2`), then `s += 3 // 1 + 1` which simplifies to `s += 3 + 1` or `s = 4`.
- If `s` is `2` (when `k` is greater than `2`), then `s += 2 // (k - 1) + 1` which simplifies to `s += 0 + 1` or `s = 3`.

Thus, the new value of `s` is `4` if `k` is `2`, and `3` if `k` is greater than `2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `k` is the first integer from the input; `x` is the second integer from the input and must be greater than 0; `a` is the third integer from the input; `s` is 4 if `k` is 2, otherwise `s` is 3; `i` is incremented by 1.**
