To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned values from the input.
- `s` is calculated as `x * (2k / (k - 1))`.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `s` Calculation**:
   - `s` is calculated using the formula `x * (2k / (k - 1))`.
   - This means `s` is a value derived from the multiplication of `x` and the result of the division `2k / (k - 1)`.

2. **Condition in the `print` Statement**:
   - The `print` statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Output Determination:
- The output depends on the comparison between `a` and `s`.
- Since the exact values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot determine a specific numerical output.
- However, we can precisely describe the output based on the given information.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output 'Yes' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated value of `s` (where `s` is `x * (2k / (k - 1))`), otherwise it will output 'No'.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= s else 'No' (where s is x * (2k / (k - 1)))**
