To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the line `inx = func_1(left, x)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only assume that `inx` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`. The other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code.

Given:
- `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
- `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1.
- `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`.
- `last` is unchanged.
- `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
- `inx` is `last[i - 1]` if `inx < 0` is false, otherwise `inx` remains unchanged.
- `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

After executing `inx = func_1(left, x)`, `inx` will be updated to the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`. All other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**
