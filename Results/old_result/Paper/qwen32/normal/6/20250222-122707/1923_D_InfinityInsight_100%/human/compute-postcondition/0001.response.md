The code snippet assigns the list `[-1]` to the variable `last`. This assignment does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, or `left`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `last` and retains the initial values of `a`, `n`, and `left`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`; `left` is a list containing the single element `0`; `last` is `[-1]`.**
