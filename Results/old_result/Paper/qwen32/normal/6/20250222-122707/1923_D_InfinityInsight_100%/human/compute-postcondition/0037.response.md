The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given that the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]` and all other elements are `-1`, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and is less than `0`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`.**
