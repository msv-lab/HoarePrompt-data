Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where a slime can be eaten by either of its neighbors, and it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code and compare it to the problem description:

1. **Initialization and Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, x)`: This function is intended to find the index in the list `a` where the value is greater than `x`. However, it does not handle the case where `x` is not found correctly and can return incorrect indices.
   - `func_2(a, n)`: This function is supposed to compute the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten. However, it does not correctly handle the logic for slimes that can be eaten by either of their neighbors.

2. **Main Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The code initializes `left` with cumulative sums of the slime sizes and `last` to keep track of the last occurrence of a different slime size.
   - It then iterates over the slimes to determine if a slime can eat its left neighbor. If it can, it sets the answer to 1.
   - For slimes that cannot eat their left neighbor, it attempts to find the correct index using `func_1` and `last`. However, this logic is flawed and does not correctly handle the scenario where a slime can be eaten by either of its neighbors.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle cases where a slime can be eaten by either of its neighbors. For example, in the input `[2, 2, 3, 1, 1]`, the third slime (size 3) can be eaten by the second slime (size 2) or the fourth slime (size 1). The current code does not correctly handle such scenarios.
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where a slime cannot be eaten at all, which should result in `-1`.

Let's consider a specific test case that the program does not handle correctly:

**Test Case**:
```
3
5
2 2 3 1 1
```

**Expected Output**:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```

**Actual Output** (as per the provided code):
The provided code might not produce the correct output due to the flawed logic in handling the scenarios mentioned above.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
