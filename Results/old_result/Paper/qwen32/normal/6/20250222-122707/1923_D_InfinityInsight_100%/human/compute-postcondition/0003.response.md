To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, so the variables `i` and `n` are relevant here.

Let's analyze the provided state:
- `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
- `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n >= 1`.
- `left` is a list containing the single element `0`.
- `last` is `[-1]`.
- `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`.

The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. If `n` is 1, the range `(1, 1)` is empty, and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` does not need to be adjusted because it is the loop variable and will be initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 1`; `left` is a list containing the single element `0`; `last` is `[-1]`; `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`.**
