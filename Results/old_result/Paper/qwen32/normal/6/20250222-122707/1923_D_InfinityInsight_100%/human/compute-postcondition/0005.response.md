The code snippet `last.append(i)` appends the current index `i` to the list `last`. Given the initial state, `last` was initialized to `[-1]`. After executing the code, `last` will contain two elements: `[-1, i]`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `n`, `left`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n == len(a)` and `n > 1`. `left` is a list containing the single element `0`. `last` is `[-1, i]`. `ans` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `-1`. The current element `a[i]` is not equal to the previous element `a[i - 1]`.**
