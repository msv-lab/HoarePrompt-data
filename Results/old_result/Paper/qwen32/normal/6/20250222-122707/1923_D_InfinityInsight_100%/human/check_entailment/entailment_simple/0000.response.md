### Reasoning:

The provided code is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime based on the given rules. The algorithm operates in two main parts: 

1. **Forward Pass (`func_2(a, n)`)**: This function processes the list of slime sizes from left to right to calculate the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
2. **Backward Pass (`func_2(a[::-1], n)`)**: This function processes the list of slime sizes from right to left to calculate the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten, then reverses the result to align with the original order.

The approach uses cumulative sums (`left` array) and a binary search (`func_1`) to efficiently find the position where a slime can eat another slime. The `last` array keeps track of the last position where the slime size changed, which helps in determining the correct position for eating.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

- **Initialization**: The `left` array is initialized with a cumulative sum of slime sizes, and `last` keeps track of the last index where the slime size changed.
- **Forward Pass**: For each slime, if it is smaller than the previous one, it can be eaten immediately (1 second). Otherwise, the code uses binary search to find the position where the current slime can eat another slime.
- **Backward Pass**: The same logic is applied, but the list is processed in reverse. This ensures that all possible ways the process can go are considered.
- **Combining Results**: The results from the forward and backward passes are combined to find the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten. If a slime cannot be eaten in either pass, it is marked as `-1`.

The provided code seems to correctly implement the described algorithm and handles the edge cases, such as when a slime cannot be eaten by any other slime.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the provided code appears to be correct for the given problem description and the provided examples.
