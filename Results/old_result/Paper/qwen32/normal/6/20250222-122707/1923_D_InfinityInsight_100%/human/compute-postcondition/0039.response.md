The code snippet provided modifies the `i`-th element of the `ans` list. Given that `inx` is less than `0`, the expression `i + 1 - inx` will result in a value greater than `i + 1`. However, since `inx` is less than `0`, the exact value will be `i + 1 - inx`.

Since `inx` is less than `0`, the specific value of `inx` does not change, and `inx2` remains `last[i - 1]`.

The only variable that changes in the given code is `ans[i]`, which is set to `i + 1 - inx`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is now `i + 1 - inx` (previously `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]` and `-1` otherwise), `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)` and is less than `0`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`.**
