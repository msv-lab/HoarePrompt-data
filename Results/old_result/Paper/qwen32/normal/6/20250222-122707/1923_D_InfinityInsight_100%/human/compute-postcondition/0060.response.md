Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a` and is greater than 1, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0`, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx2` is updated to `last[i - 1]`.**
