Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it updates the `sm` (sum of matching elements) variable. The condition to adjust `sm` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the changes in the count of elements when the sliding window moves.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Add the new element to the window
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        # Adjust sm if the new element is a match and its count in ca is within the count in cb
        sm += (ca[a[r]] <= cb[a[r]])
        # Remove the old element from the window
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        # Adjust sm if the old element was a match and its count in ca is less than the count in cb
        sm -= (ca[a[r - m]] < cb[a[r - m]])
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

In this corrected version, the logic for adjusting `sm` is more precise. When a new element is added to the window, it checks if the count of that element in `ca` is within the count in `cb` to determine if it contributes to `sm`. Similarly, when an element is removed from the window, it checks if the count of that element in `ca` was previously within the count in `cb` to determine if it should be subtracted from `sm`.
