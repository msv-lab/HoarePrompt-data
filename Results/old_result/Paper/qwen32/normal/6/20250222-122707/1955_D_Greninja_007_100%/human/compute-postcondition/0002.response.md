Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^6. `cb` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`. `ca` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`. `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
