You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Breakdown

The task is to determine the number of subsegments of length `m` in array `a` that can be rearranged to match at least `k` elements of array `b`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of elements in `a` and `b`.
   - It initializes `cb` as a `Counter` for the sorted elements of `b`.
   - It initializes `ca` as a `Counter` for the first `m` elements of `a`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - It calculates the intersection of `ca` and `cb` using `ca & cb` and sums the values to get `sm`, which represents the number of elements in the first subsegment of `a` that can be matched with elements in `b`.
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window, it adjusts `sm`:
     - If the count of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than its count in `cb`, it means adding `a[r]` increases the number of matchable elements, so `sm` is incremented.
     - It then increments the count of `a[r]` in `ca`.
   - For each element `a[r - m]` removed from the window, it adjusts `sm`:
     - If the count of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`, it means removing `a[r - m]` decreases the number of matchable elements, so `sm` is decremented.
     - It then decrements the count of `a[r - m]` in `ca`.
   - If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k` after these adjustments, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the count of good subsegments for each test case.

### Issues in the Program

The program has a few issues that could lead to incorrect results:

1. **Sorting**:
   - The `Counter` class does not require sorted input. Sorting `b` and `a[:m]` before creating `Counter` objects is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because the order of elements does not matter for counting.

2. **Logic for Adjusting `sm`**:
   - The logic for adjusting `sm` when adding and removing elements from the sliding window is flawed. The condition `if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]` and `if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]` are not correct. Instead, the program should check if the count of the element being added or removed affects the number of matchable elements.

### Corrected Logic

The corrected logic for adjusting `sm` should be:

- When adding `a[r]`:
  - If the count of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than its count in `cb` before adding, increment `sm`.
- When removing `a[r - m]`:
  - If the count of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb` after removing, decrement `sm`.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to unnecessary sorting and flawed logic for adjusting `sm`.
