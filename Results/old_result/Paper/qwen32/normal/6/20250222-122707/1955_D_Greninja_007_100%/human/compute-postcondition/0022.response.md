Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with `ca[a[r]]` incremented by 1, `ca[a[r - m]]` decremented by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` is decremented by 1. If `ca[a[r]]` is less than `cb[a[r]]`, `sm` is incremented by 1. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, `r` is m + 1.**

In simple terms, the frequency of the element `a[r]` in the `Counter` object `ca` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `cb`, `sm`, `ans`, and `r` remain unchanged except for the updated `ca`.
