The code snippet assigns the integer value at the index `idx` of the list `data` to the variable `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 2`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the conditions in the loop body, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx])`.**
