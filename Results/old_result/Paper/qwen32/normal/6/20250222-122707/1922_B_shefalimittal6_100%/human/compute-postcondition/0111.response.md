Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n` (or reflects the count of each unique `x` value). `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. `idx` is `idx + 3n + 2` and `cnt` is 0. `results` now includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times.**

This postcondition retains all the conditions stated in the precondition and includes the specific condition that `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, which is the condition that allows the if statement to be executed.
