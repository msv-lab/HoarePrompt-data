The code snippet `results.append(str(ans))` appends the string representation of `ans` to the `results` list. The value of `ans` is already given as `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n`, `idx` is `idx + (n + 1) * (3n + 2)`, `cnt` is `n`, `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, `results` includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times for each of the `n + 1` iterations, and `results` now includes `str(ans)` one more time.**
