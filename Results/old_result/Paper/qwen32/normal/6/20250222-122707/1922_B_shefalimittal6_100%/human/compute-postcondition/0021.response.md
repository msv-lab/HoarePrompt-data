The code increments the value at index `x` in the list `v` by 1. Given that `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is initially 2, after the operation, `v[x]` will be 3. All other elements of `v` and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is 3, `x` is `int(data[idx])`.**
