The code snippet provided only increments the value of `idx` by 1. Therefore, the value of `idx` will be `idx + 1` after the execution of the code. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 3`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the conditions in the loop body, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx - 1])`.**
