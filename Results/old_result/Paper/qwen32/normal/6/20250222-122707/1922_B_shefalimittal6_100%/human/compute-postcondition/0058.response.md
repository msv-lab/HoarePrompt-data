Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is at least 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is 2, `idx` is `idx + n + 3`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (now `cnt + 1`), `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the updated values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx - 1])`.**

Explanation: The value at index `x` in the list `v` is incremented by 1, making `v[x]` equal to 2. The sum `cnt` of all elements in `v` is now increased by 1. The value of `ans` is recalculated based on the new values in `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
