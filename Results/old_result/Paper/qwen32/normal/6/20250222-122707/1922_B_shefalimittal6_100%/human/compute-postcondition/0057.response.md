The code snippet provided increments the value of `idx` by 1. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is at least 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is 1, `idx` is `idx + n + 3`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v` (previously `cnt` but now `cnt + 1` if considering the effect of the operation), `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx - 1])`.**

In natural language: The value of `idx` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
