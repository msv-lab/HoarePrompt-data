Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5; `input` holds the entire input read from standard input; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` by whitespace; `idx` is 2; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        v[x] += 1
    cnt = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if v[i] >= 2:
            ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
        if v[i] >= 3:
            ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
        cnt += v[i]
    results.append(str(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `x` in `data`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is the integer value at `data[idx]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented based on the values in `data`, `idx` is `idx + 2n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the accumulated sum of combinations based on the conditions in the loop body, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t - 1 ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` is now `n`, `idx` is `idx + (n + 1) * (3n + 2)`, `cnt` is `n`, `ans` is `n * (n - 1) // 2 + n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`, `results` includes `str(ans)` appended `n` times for each of the `n + 1` iterations, and `results` now includes `str(ans)` one more time.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
