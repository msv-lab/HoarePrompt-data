Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `x` in `data`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end.**

Natural language: The variable `results` has been updated to include the string representation of `ans` at the end. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
