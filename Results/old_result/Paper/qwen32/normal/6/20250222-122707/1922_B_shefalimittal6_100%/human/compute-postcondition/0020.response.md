The code snippet `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results`, `v`, `x`) remain unchanged as per the initial state provided.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is 2, `x` is `int(data[idx])`**.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` remains greater than 0, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is incremented by 1, `results` remain unchanged, `v` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` being 2, and `x` remains `int(data[idx])`.
