The code snippet `cnt += v[i]` increments the variable `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `cnt` is incremented by `v[2]`.

The initial state specifies that `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`. Since `i` is 2, this means `cnt` was initially `cnt + v[2]`. After executing the code, `cnt` becomes `cnt + v[2] + v[2]`, which simplifies to `cnt + 2 * v[2]`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements, `idx` is `idx + n`, `cnt` is `cnt + 2 * v[2]`, `i` is 2. If `v[2]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
