The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The loop's continuation depends on the variable `n` and the implicit counter that `range(n)` manages.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`.
- `results` remain as given.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented by 1.
- `x` is `int(data[idx])`.

The loop will execute `n` times, and the counter managed by `range(n)` will be incremented by 1 after each iteration.

Since the loop head does not contain any variables that need to be adjusted, and the loop's continuation is managed by the range, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same except for the implicit counter in `range(n)`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros except `v[x]` which is incremented by 1, `x` is `int(data[idx])`**.

The only thing that changes is the internal counter of the `for _ in range(n):` loop, which is not a variable in the state that we need to explicitly adjust.
