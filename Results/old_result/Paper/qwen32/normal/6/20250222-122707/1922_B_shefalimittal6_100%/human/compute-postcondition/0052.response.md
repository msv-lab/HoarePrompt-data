The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `x`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Since `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, it points to a specific position in the `data` list. The value of `x` will be the integer at that position in the `data` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `ans` is the sum of all contributions from the combinations formula based on the values in `v`, `results` now includes `str(ans)` at the end, `x` is `int(data[idx + n + 1])`.**
