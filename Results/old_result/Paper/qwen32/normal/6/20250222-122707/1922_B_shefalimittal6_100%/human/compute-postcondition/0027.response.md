The given code snippet modifies the variable `ans` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results`, `v`, `idx`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `input`, `data`, `results` remain as given, `v` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (where `x` is an integer from `data` corresponding to the current iteration) is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `data`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, and `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2; `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**
