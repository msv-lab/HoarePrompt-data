Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i <= len(a) // 2 - 1:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = m
        b[i] = n
    else:
        n = min(a[i], b[i])
        m = max(a[i], b[i])
        a[i] = n
        b[i] = m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters from the input string where `a[i]` is updated to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `a[i]` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters from the new input string where `b[i]` is updated to `n` if `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `b[i]` is updated to `m`; `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`; `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters where `a[i]` is updated to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `a[i]` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` (specifically, `a[i]` is `n` if `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`); `b` is a list of characters from the new input string where `b[i]` is updated to `n` if `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `b[i]` is updated to `m` (specifically, `b[i]` is `m` if `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`); `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`; `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`; `i` is `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is a list of characters where `a[i]` is updated to the maximum of the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `a[i]` is updated to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters where `b[i]` is `n` if `i` is less than or equal to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `b[i]` is `m`; `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`; `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `i` is greater than or equal to `len(a) // 2`; `i` is `i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
