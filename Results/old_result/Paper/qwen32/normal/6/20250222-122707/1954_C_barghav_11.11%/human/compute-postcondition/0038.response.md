Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < 10^{100}\) and \(1 \leq y < 10^{100}\), and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
3. `a` is a list of characters with at least one element.
4. `b` is a list of characters where the first half contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the second half contains the maximum values.
5. `i` is `i + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `a` is a list of characters.
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`), but the initial value of `i` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot know the exact value of `i` before the increment.
- The `print` statement will print the character at the index `i` from the list `a`.

### Output:
Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `i`.

The code will print the character at the index `i` from the list `a` after `i` has been incremented by 1.

Output: **a[i] (where i is the index after being incremented by 1)**
