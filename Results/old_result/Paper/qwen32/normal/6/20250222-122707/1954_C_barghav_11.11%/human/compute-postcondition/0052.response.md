Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `y` as strings, processes them by rearranging their digits such that the first half of the first number consists of the maximum digits and the second half consists of the minimum digits compared to the corresponding digits of the second number, and vice versa for the second number. It then prints the modified versions of both numbers.**
