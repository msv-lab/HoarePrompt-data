Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
- `a` is a list of characters with at least one element.
- `b` is a list of characters where the first half contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the second half contains the maximum values.
- `i` is `i + 1` (This indicates that `i` has been incremented by 1 at some point before this print statement).

### Analysis:
The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

We need to determine the value of `a[i]`:
- `a` is a list of characters with at least one element.
- `i` is `i + 1`, which means `i` has been incremented by 1. However, the initial value of `i` is not provided, so we can only infer that `i` is now one more than its previous value.
- Since `a` is a list of characters, `a[i]` will be the character at index `i` in the list `a`.

### Output:
The output will be the character at index `i` in the list `a`. Given the precondition, `i` has been incremented by 1, so it will print the character at the position that is one more than its previous position.

Since the exact value of `i` before the increment and the exact elements of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `a[i]`.

Output: **a[i] (where i is the current index after incrementing by 1)**
