To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end='')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
1. `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000.
2. `x` and `y` are integers, each consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and each is between 1 and 10^100.
3. `a` is a list of characters and has at least one element.
4. `b` is a list of characters where the first half contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of the original `a` and `b`, and the second half contains the maximum values. However, the original `b` list is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we only know about the modified `b` list.

### Key Points:
- The `print(a[i], end='')` statement will print the character at index `i` of the list `a`.
- The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `a` has at least one element, so `i` should be a valid index within the bounds of `a`.

### Output Analysis:
Since `i` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact character that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a` and the index `i`.

Output: **a[i] (where a is the list of characters and i is a valid index within the bounds of a)**

This description captures the essence of what will be printed based on the given initial state.
