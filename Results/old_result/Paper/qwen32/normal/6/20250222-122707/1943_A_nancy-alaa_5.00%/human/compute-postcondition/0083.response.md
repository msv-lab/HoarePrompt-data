Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0 (though `n` is not used in the print statement, it is part of the context).
- `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.
- `mpp[i]` is 1.
- `first` is True.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

From the initial state, we know that `i` is explicitly set to 0. The other variables (`n`, `mpp`, `first`) are not used in the print statement, so they do not affect the output.

Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
