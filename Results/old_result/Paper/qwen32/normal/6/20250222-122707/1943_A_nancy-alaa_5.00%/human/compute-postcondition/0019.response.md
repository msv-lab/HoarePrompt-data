Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean value; the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; `i` is incremented by 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The loop or if statement is exited due to the `break` statement. No other variables are changed except that `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions and values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remain the same.
