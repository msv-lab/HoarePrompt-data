Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, and `first` is `True`. The current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1, causing the most internal loop or if statement to be broken out of.**
