The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.

For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

The states of `mpp`, `first`, and any other variables mentioned in the conditions inside the loop body do not need to be adjusted as per the task requirement to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
