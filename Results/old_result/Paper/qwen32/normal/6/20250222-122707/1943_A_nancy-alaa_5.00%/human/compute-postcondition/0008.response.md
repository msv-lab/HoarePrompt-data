The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is `False`; `i` is not a key in `mpp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
