The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1` and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is `i + 1` from the previous iteration), making it `i + 2`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 2`**
