To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the value of `i` at the time of execution.

### Analysis of the Initial State:

1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2 · 10^4. This variable seems to represent the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly related to the value of `i` in this specific print statement.

2. **`n`**: An integer that is greater than `i + 1`. This indicates that `n` is some upper limit or length related to the list `arr`, and it must be larger than the current value of `i` plus one.

3. **`arr`**: A list of integers. The contents of this list are not specified, but it is used to populate the `mpp` Counter object.

4. **`mpp`**: A Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in `arr`. This object is used to keep track of how many times each integer appears in `arr`, but it is not directly related to the value of `i`.

5. **`first`**: A boolean value. This variable is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output of `print(i)`.

6. **`i`**: Initially, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`). This means that the value of `i` printed will be one more than its previous value.

### Determining the Output:

Given the statement `i = i + 1`, the value of `i` that will be printed is the previous value of `i` plus one. However, the exact initial value of `i` before the increment is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the output in terms of its relationship to the previous value of `i`.

### Conclusion:

The `print(i)` statement will output the value of `i` after it has been incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we can only describe the printed value as one more than its previous value.

Output: **i (where i is the value of i after it has been incremented by 1)**
