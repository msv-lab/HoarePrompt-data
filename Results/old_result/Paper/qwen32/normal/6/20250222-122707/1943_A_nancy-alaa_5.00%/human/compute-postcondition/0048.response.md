Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object representing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `first` is `True`. The current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `first` remains `True`, and the value of `i` remains a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` are unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
