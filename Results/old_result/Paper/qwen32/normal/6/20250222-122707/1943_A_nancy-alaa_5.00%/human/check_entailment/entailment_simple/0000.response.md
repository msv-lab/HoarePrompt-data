### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine the final score of the game based on the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly simulate the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.

Hereâ€™s the detailed reasoning:

1. **Game Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` by strategically choosing elements.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c` by strategically choosing elements.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each element in `arr` using a `Counter`.
   - The program iterates from 0 to `n-1` and checks two conditions:
     - If the current number `i` is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., `i` is not in `arr`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If the current number `i` appears exactly once in `arr` and a previous unique number has already been encountered (`first` is `True`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If the current number `i` appears exactly once in `arr` (but no previous unique number has been encountered), it sets `first` to `True`.

3. **Flaws in the Program**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply checks the conditions and prints the MEX based on the initial state of the array without considering the optimal moves of both players.
   - The `first` variable is used incorrectly. It does not correctly reflect the state of the game where Alice and Bob take turns.
   - The program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob can choose elements in such a way to either maximize or minimize the MEX, respectively.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves simulating the game with optimal strategies for both players. This could involve using a greedy approach or dynamic programming to determine the best moves.
   - For example, Alice can always try to pick the smallest number not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob can try to pick numbers that minimize the MEX.

### Conclusion:

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly determine the final score of the game based on the optimal play of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
