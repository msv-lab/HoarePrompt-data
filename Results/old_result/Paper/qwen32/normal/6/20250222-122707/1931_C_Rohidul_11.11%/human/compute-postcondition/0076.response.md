Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 1, `end` is 0, `ans` is -1 if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, otherwise `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st == 0` and `end == 0`, or `ans` is 0 if `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input where `a[0] == a[1]`, `st` is 0**

In simple terms, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
