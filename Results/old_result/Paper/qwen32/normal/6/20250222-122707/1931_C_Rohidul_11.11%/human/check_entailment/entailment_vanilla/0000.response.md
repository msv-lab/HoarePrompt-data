Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to make all elements of the array equal by applying the operation at most once. The operation allows us to select a subarray and set all its elements to a specific value, and the cost of this operation is the length of the subarray. We need to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

### Logic of the Program

The program seems to be trying to find the minimum cost by considering the longest contiguous segments at the beginning and end of the array that have the same value. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, read the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Finding the Longest Prefix and Suffix**:
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - `st` and `end` are counters for the length of the longest prefix and suffix that have the same value as the first and last element of the array, respectively.
   - The program increments `l` and `st` while `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
   - The program decrements `r` and `end` while `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

3. **Calculating the Cost**:
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the program calculates the cost as `r - l - 1`.
   - If the first and last elements are different and there are no contiguous segments at the beginning and end, the program calculates the cost as `len(a) - 1`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost as `r - l`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated cost.

### Issues in the Program

The logic of the program has several issues:

- **Handling Different Values**: The program does not correctly handle cases where the first and last elements are different and there are no contiguous segments at the beginning and end that can be used to minimize the cost. The formula `len(a) - 1` is not always correct in this case.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array is already uniform or has only one element correctly.
- **Subarray Selection**: The program does not consider the possibility of selecting a subarray in the middle of the array that can minimize the cost more effectively than using the prefix and suffix.

### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve considering the following:

- If the array is already uniform, the cost is 0.
- Otherwise, consider the cost of making the entire array equal to the most frequent element in the array, or to the first or last element, or to any other element by selecting an appropriate subarray.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the program's logic, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
