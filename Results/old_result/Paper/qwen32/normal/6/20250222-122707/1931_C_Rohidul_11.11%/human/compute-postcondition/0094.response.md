To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the given conditions.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `l` is `n - 1` if all elements are equal, otherwise the first index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]`.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `end` is `0`.
   - `ans` is determined by initial conditions.
   - `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues while `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - `r` is decremented by `1`.
   - `end` is incremented by `1`.

### Observations from Given Output States:
- After the first 3 iterations, `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, and `end` is `3`.
- This indicates that the loop has been decrementing `r` and incrementing `end` for 3 iterations, which means `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2] == a[n - 3]`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will continue to decrement `r` and increment `end` as long as `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
- Since `l` is `n - 2` after 3 iterations and the loop condition `r > l` is still satisfied, the loop will continue until `r` is no longer equal to `l` or `a[r] != a[r - 1]`.

### Final Output State:
- If all elements in the array `a` are equal, `l` will eventually become `0` and `r` will also become `0`.
- `end` will be equal to `n - 1` because all elements are equal and the loop will run `n - 1` times.
- `ans` and `st` will remain unchanged as per the initial conditions since they are not affected by the loop.

### Final Output State in the Required Format:
Output State: **`l` is `0`, `r` is `0`, `end` is `n - 1`, `ans` is determined by initial conditions, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After all iterations, `l` and `r` will both be `0` if all elements in the array are equal. The variable `end` will be `n - 1`, indicating that the loop ran `n - 1` times, decrementing `r` each time. The variables `ans` and `st` remain unchanged from their initial values.
