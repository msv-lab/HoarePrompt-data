The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `l` was 0, so now `l` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and `n` must be at least 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 0; `end` is 0.
