The code snippet `end += 1` increments the value of the variable `end` by 1. Since `end` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can infer that `end` is initially 0 (as per the pattern of the examples provided, where unspecified variables are often assumed to be initialized to 0). After the increment, `end` becomes 1. The variables `l` and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is 0, `end` is 1**.
