The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the variable `a` will now hold the list of integers provided in the input.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the list of integers from the input; `l` is the first index `k` where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list. If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` and both `st` and `end` are 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
