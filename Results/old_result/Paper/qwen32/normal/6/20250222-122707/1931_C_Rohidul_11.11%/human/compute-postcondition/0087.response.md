The code snippet `end += 1` increments the value of the variable `end` by 1. The previous values of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `ans`, `st`, and the condition `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`) are not affected.

Since `end` was initially 0, after the increment, `end` becomes 1.

Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `end` is 1, `ans` is determined by initial conditions, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start, and `a[n - 1] == a[n - 2]`.**
