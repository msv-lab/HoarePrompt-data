The value of `r` is decremented by 1. Initially, `r` is 1, so after the operation, `r` becomes 0. The condition `a[r] is equal to a[r - 1]` is still valid, but now it translates to `a[0] is equal to a[-1]`. Since `l` is 0 and its value does not change, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is 0, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`**
