To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of `r` and `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` according to the loop condition `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - `r > l`: This condition requires `r` to be greater than `l`.
   - `a[r] == a[r - 1]`: This condition requires the element at index `r` in array `a` to be equal to the element at index `r - 1` in array `a`.

2. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Ensure `r` is greater than `l`. This can be done by setting `r` to a value greater than `l`.
   - Ensure `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`. This can be done by setting the elements at indices `r` and `r - 1` to the same value.

### Example Adjustment:

Let's assume `l` is 0 (a common initial value for such loops).

- Set `r` to 1 (or any value greater than `l`).
- Set `a[1]` to a value, say `x`.
- Set `a[0]` to the same value `x`.

### Adjusted State:

State: **`l` is 0, `r` is 1, `a[0]` is `x`, `a[1]` is `x`**

In this state, both conditions `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` are satisfied, so the loop can execute its first iteration.

### Final Answer:

State: **`l` is 0, `r` is 1, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`**
