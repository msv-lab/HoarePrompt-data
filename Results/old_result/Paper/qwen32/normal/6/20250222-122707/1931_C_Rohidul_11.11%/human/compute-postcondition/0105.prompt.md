Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    st, end = 0, 0
    while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
        l += 1
        st += 1
    while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
        r -= 1
        end += 1
    if a[0] == a[-1]:
        ans = r - l - 1
    elif st == 0 and end == 0 and a[0] != a[-1]:
        ans = len(a) - 1
    else:
        ans = r - l
    print(max(0, ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers; `l` is the first index `k` where `a[k] != a[k + 1]` or `n - 1` if all elements are equal; `r` is `l`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements starting from index 0; `end` is the count of consecutive equal elements at the end of the list. If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a` and both `st` and `end` are 0, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` remains 0, `r` remains 0, `end` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, `ans` is -1. Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st == 0` and `end == 0`, or `ans` is 0 if `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is `0`, `r` is `0`, `end` is `n - 1`, `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `-1`. Otherwise, if `st` is `0` and `end` is `0`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
