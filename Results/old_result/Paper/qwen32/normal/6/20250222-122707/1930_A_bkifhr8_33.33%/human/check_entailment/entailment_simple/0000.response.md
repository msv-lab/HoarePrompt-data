### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, sorting the list of integers, and then summing up the minimum values of each pair. However, there are several issues in the provided code that lead to incorrect behavior:

1. **Incorrect Pair Selection and Removal**:
   - The code incorrectly tries to remove elements from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always be `0` and `2`, respectively, and will not correctly remove the intended elements.
   - The code does not sort the list before selecting pairs, which is necessary to ensure that the minimum values are always selected optimally.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2` is not correctly handling the pair selection process. The loop should continue until all pairs are processed, not just until the list has two elements left.

3. **Simplified Pair Selection**:
   - The problem can be solved more efficiently by sorting the list and summing up the elements at even indices, which represent the minimum values of each pair when the list is sorted.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
