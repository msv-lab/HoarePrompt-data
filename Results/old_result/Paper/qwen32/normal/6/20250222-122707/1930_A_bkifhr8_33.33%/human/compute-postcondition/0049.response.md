The code snippet `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 of the list `lst`. Given the initial state, `lst` is a list of substrings from the input string `l` with the first element removed. Therefore, the element at index 2 of `lst` is the third element of the original list of substrings (since the first element was removed).

After the removal, the list `lst` will have one less element, and the elements after the removed element will shift down by one index.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is twice the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with the first element removed and the third element (original index 2) removed, `i` is 1.**
