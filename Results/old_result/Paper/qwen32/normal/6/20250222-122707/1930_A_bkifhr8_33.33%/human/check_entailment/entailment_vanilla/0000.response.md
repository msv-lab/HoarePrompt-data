Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the score by performing exactly `n` moves, where each move involves choosing two integers from the list, adding the smaller of the two to the score, and removing both integers from the list.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes the score `ans` to 0.
   - It reads the list of integers as a string and splits it into a list of strings `lst`.
   - The program then enters a loop that is supposed to iterate `n` times, but the loop condition is incorrect (`for i in range(n * 2)` instead of `for i in range(n)`).

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - Inside the loop, the program attempts to add the minimum of the first two elements in `lst` to `ans`.
   - It then removes the first two elements from `lst`. However, the removal logic is incorrect: `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` will always try to remove the first element twice, and the indices are being calculated incorrectly.

4. **Handling the Last Move:**
   - The `else` block is intended to handle the last move when only two elements remain in `lst`. However, this block is only executed when `len(lst) != 2` is false, which is not the correct condition to handle the last two elements.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results stored in `ans_f`.

### Issues Identified:
- The loop condition is incorrect (`for i in range(n * 2)` instead of `for i in range(n)`).
- The logic for removing elements from the list is incorrect.
- The `else` block is not correctly handling the last move.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correctly implementing the logic to achieve the maximum score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
