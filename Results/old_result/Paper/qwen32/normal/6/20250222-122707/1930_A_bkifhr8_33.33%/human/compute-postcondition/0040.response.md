The code removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is index 0) from the list `lst`. This means the first element of `lst` is removed. The values of `t`, `ans_f`, `ans`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The length of `lst` is now one less than it was before.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with the first element removed, `i` is 0.**
