Output State: **`t` is greater than the new value of `n` * 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` twice, `ans` is the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst` plus the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst` again, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is either a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces with its first and third elements removed or a list with exactly 2 elements, and `i` is `n * 2 + 1`.**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated to be twice the minimum of the integer values of the first and second elements of `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged.
