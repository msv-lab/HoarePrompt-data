The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than or equal to 1. The state of `ans_f` does not affect whether the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to start. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(t)` function, so we do not need to set it before the loop starts.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans_f` is an empty list**
