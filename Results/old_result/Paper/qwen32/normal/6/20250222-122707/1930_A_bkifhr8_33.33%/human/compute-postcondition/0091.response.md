The code snippet `ans_f.append(ans)` adds the value of `ans` to the end of the list `ans_f`. Given that `ans_f` initially contains `ans` twice, after appending `ans` again, `ans_f` will contain `ans` three times.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `lst`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than `n * 2`, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans` three times, `ans` is the accumulated sum of the minimum values from the first two elements of `lst` for each iteration until `lst` had exactly 2 elements, `n` is the new input integer, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list with 2 or fewer elements, and `i` is `n * 2`.**
