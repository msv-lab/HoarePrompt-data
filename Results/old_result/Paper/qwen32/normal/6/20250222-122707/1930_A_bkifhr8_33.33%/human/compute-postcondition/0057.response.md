The code snippet `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` adds the minimum of the integer values of the first two elements in the list `lst` to the variable `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 2
- `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`
- `ans` is twice the minimum of the integers from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`
- `n` is greater than 0
- `l` is the new input string
- `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces
- `i` is 2

The value of `ans` will be updated to its current value plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`, `ans` is its previous value plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is the new input string, `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces, `i` is 2**.
