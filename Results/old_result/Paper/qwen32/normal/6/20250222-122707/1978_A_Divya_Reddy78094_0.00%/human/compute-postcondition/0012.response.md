The code snippet provided is `n = int(input())`. This line of code takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `n` was already mentioned in the initial state as an input integer, but the code snippet implies that a new value is being assigned to `n`.

Given that the initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order and `t` holds its original value, these variables are not affected by the provided code snippet. The only change is the reassignment of `n` to a new integer value provided by the user.

Output State: **`t` is `t`, `n` is a new input integer, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
