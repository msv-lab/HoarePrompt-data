To determine the output of the given Python code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 500.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

### Python Code Snippet:
```python
print(nums[0] + nums[1])
```

### Analysis:
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- `nums[0]` is the first element of the list, which is the largest element.
- `nums[1]` is the second element of the list, which is the second largest element.

### Calculation:
- The code snippet calculates the sum of the first two elements of the list `nums`, which are the two largest elements in the list.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `nums` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the properties of the `nums` list:
- `nums[0]` is the largest integer in the list.
- `nums[1]` is the second largest integer in the list.
- The output will be the sum of these two integers.

Thus, the output will be the sum of the two largest integers in the list `nums`.

Output: **nums[0] + nums[1] (where nums[0] is the largest integer and nums[1] is the second largest integer in the list `nums`)**
