The code snippet sorts the list `nums` in descending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `nums` is now ordered from the largest to the smallest element.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= `t` <= 500; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
