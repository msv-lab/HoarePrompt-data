### Reasoning:

The task is to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile. The strategy to achieve this is straightforward:

1. **Input Parsing:** The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages in each book.
2. **Sorting:** The program sorts the list of pages in descending order.
3. **Selection:** The program selects the two largest numbers from the sorted list, which represent the books with the highest number of pages in each pile.
4. **Output:** It then prints the sum of these two numbers, which is the maximum number of pages Alice can read.

This approach is correct because the two largest numbers in the list will always yield the maximum sum for the books read from each pile. By sorting the list in descending order, the two largest numbers are always the first two elements, and their sum gives the maximum possible pages Alice can read.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile.
