The value of `k` is decremented by `2 * x`. The variables `n`, `nums`, `ans`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k - 2 * x <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-2 integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element that was in `nums` minus `x`, `b` is the last element that was in `nums` minus `x`, `x` is min(a, b)**.
