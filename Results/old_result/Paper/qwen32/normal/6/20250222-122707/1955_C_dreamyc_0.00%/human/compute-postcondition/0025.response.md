The value of `a` is decreased by `x`, where `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least 2 integers (excluding the first and last elements that were `a` and `b`), `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the new first element of the deque minus `x`, `b` is the new last element of the deque, and `x` is `min(a, b)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least 2 integers (excluding the first and last elements that were `a` and `b`), `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is `a - x`, `b` is the new last element of the deque, and `x` is `min(a, b)`**.
