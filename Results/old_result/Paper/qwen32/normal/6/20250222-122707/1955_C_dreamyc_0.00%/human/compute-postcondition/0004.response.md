The value of `x` is assigned the minimum value between `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `k`, `nums`, `ans` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are also unchanged, but `x` now holds the smaller of the two values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-2 integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element that was in `nums`, `b` is the last element that was in `nums`, `x` is min(a, b)**.
