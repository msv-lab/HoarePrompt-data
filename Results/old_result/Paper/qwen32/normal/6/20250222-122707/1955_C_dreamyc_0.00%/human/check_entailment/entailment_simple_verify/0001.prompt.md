You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of durabilities `nums`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The `func_1` function handles the logic for each test case.
   - The list `nums` is converted to a `deque` for efficient popping from both ends.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to count the number of ships that have sunk.

3. **Kraken Attacks Simulation:**
   - The program uses a `while` loop to simulate the Kraken's attacks, which continues as long as there are attacks left (`k > 0`) and there are at least two ships (`len(nums) >= 2`).
   - Inside the loop, the program pops the first and last elements from the deque (`a` and `b`), representing the first and last ships.
   - The variable `x` is set to the minimum of `a` and `b`, representing the maximum number of attacks that can be fully absorbed by both ships.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, the ships' durabilities are reduced by `x`, and `k` is decreased by `2 * x`.
   - If `k` is less than `2 * x`, the loop breaks as the Kraken cannot fully attack both ships.
   - After the attack, if a ship's durability is greater than 0, it is appended back to the deque; otherwise, the `ans` counter is incremented.

4. **Handling the Last Ship:**
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left and `k` is still greater than or equal to its durability, that ship is also sunk, and `ans` is incremented.

5. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints the number of ships that have sunk.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attack pattern by alternating between the first and last ships.
- It efficiently handles the decrement of durability and the removal of ships that have sunk.
- The use of a `deque` allows for efficient popping from both ends, which is crucial given the constraints.
- The logic for handling the last ship when there is only one ship left is correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken based on the given problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
