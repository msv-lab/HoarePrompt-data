Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0 minus `2 * x`, `nums` is a deque with at least `n-2` integers, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is the new first element of the deque before the operation minus `x`, `b` is the new last element of the deque minus `x`, and `x` is `min(a, b)`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is now `k - 2 * x`. The values of `n`, `nums`, `ans`, `a`, and `b` remain the same except `b` which is updated to `b - x`.
