Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least `n-2` integers, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `a` is the new first element of the deque before the operation, `b` is the new last element of the deque before the operation, and `x` is `min(a, b)`**.

In natural language: The value of `x` is now the minimum of `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
