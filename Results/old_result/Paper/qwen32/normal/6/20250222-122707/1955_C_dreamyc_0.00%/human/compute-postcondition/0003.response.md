The code snippet removes the first and last elements from the deque `nums` and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`, respectively. Given the initial state, the values of `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The deque `nums` will now have two fewer elements, and the variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the first and last elements that were removed from `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-2 integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and `ans` is 0; `a` is the first element that was in `nums`; `b` is the last element that was in `nums`.**
