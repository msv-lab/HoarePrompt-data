Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a deque of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The `nums` list has been converted into a deque, but the values of `n`, `k`, and the individual elements of `nums` remain unchanged.
