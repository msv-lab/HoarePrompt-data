Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least `n-1` integers if `a > 0` (with `a` added to the left), or with at least `n-2` integers if `a <= 0`. `ans` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `a > 0`; otherwise, `ans` is either 2, 3, or 4. `a` is the new first element of the deque, and `b` is the new last element of the deque. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * x`, `a` is reduced by `x`, and `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. `x` is `min(a, b)` in both cases.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state provided.
