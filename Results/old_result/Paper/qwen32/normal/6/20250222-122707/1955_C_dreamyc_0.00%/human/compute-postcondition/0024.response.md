Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least 2 integers (excluding the first and last elements that were `a` and `b`), `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` is the new first element of the deque, `b` is the new last element of the deque, and `x` is `min(a, b)`**

Natural Language: The value of `x` has been updated to be the minimum of `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
