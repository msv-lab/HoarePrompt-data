Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (an integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` integers). If `nums` contains exactly one element, the function returns `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the count of elements that were completely reduced to 0. Otherwise, it returns `ans`, which is the count of elements that were completely reduced to 0.**
