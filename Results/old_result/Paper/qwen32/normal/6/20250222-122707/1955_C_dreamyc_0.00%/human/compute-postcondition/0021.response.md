Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n-2, n-1, or n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of `nums` respectively, and `x` is min(a, b). If `b` > 0, `nums` has `n` integers with the first element being `a` and the last being `b`. If `k` >= 2 * x, `a` and `b` are each reduced by `x`. If `b` is 0, `ans` is set to 1 or 2 depending on whether `a` is greater than 0 or not. If `a` is greater than 0, `nums` has `n-1` integers with the first element being `a` and the rest being the original `nums` elements. If `a` is 0, `nums` has `n-2` integers and `ans` is set to 1.**
