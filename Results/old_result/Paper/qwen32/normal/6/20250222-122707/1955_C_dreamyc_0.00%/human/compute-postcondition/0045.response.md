The code snippet provided is `ans += 1`. This means the value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `x`) remain unchanged as they are not modified in the given code snippet.

Given that `ans` was initially either 0, 1, 2, or 3, after executing `ans += 1`, `ans` will be either 1, 2, 3, or 4 respectively. However, since `ans` can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3 as per the initial state, the only valid increments are from 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3. The value 3 cannot be incremented further within the given constraints.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque with at least `n-2` integers, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3, `a` is the new first element of the deque, and `b` is the new last element of the deque. If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * x`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * x`, `a` is reduced by `x`, and `b` is reduced by `x`. Otherwise, the loop or statement is broken out without modifying `k`, `a`, or `b`. `x` is `min(a, b)` in both cases.**
