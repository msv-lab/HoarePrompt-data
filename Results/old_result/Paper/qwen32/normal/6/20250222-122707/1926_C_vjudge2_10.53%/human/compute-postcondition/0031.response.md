The code snippet provided is `remainder = int(word[:-1])`. This line of code takes the string `word`, removes the last character from it, and converts the resulting substring back into an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `remainder`.

Given the initial state, `word` is the string representation of `i`, and `last` is the integer value of the last digit of `word`. Since the code does not modify `word` or `last`, these variables remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `remainder`, which is derived from `word`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first 10 elements set to `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]` and all other elements initialized to 0, `total` is 45, `n` must be at least 10, `word` is the string representation of `i`, `last` is the integer value of the last digit of `word`, `remainder` is the integer value of `word` with the last digit removed.**
