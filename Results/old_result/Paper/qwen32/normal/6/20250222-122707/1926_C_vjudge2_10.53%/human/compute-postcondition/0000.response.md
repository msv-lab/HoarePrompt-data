`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The output state includes the value of `t` as the input integer, and the precondition about the input range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is still valid.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
