Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:** 
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (number of test cases).
   - Each of the next `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5).
2. **Processing:**
   - For each `n`, we need to replace each integer from 1 to `n` with the sum of its digits.
   - We then need to compute the sum of these new values.
3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output the sum of the numbers after the replacement.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `t` as the number of test cases.
   - It then reads each `n` and stores them in a list called `numbers`.
   - Two lists `values` and `sum_values` are initialized. `values[i]` will store the sum of the digits of `i`, and `sum_values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of `values` up to `i`.
   - `total` is used to keep track of the cumulative sum of `values` as we populate it.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program initializes `values` and `sum_values` for numbers from 0 to 9. This is done because the sum of digits for single-digit numbers is the number itself.
   - For numbers from 10 to `n`, it calculates the sum of digits by breaking the number into its last digit (`last`) and the remaining part (`remainder`).
   - `values[i]` is then set to `values[last] + values[remainder]`.
   - `sum_values[i]` is updated to be the sum of `values[i]` and `sum_values[i - 1]`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - For each `n` in `numbers`, the program prints `sum_values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the sum of digits from 1 to `n`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Scope of `n`:** The variable `n` used in the preprocessing loop (`for i in range(10, n + 1)`) is not defined in that scope. It should be `max(numbers)` instead to ensure all numbers up to the largest `n` across all test cases are processed.
- **Function Call:** The program starts with a call to `func_1()`, which is unnecessary and should be removed. The function should be executed directly.
- **Output:** The program correctly computes and prints the sum of the sum of digits for each test case.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

# Execute the function directly
func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the undefined scope of `n` in the preprocessing loop. After correcting the scope of `n` to `max(numbers)`, the program should work correctly.

**Correctness: False** (before correction)  
**Correctness: True** (after correction)
