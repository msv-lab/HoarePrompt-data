The code appends the newly input integer `n` to the list `numbers`. Initially, `numbers` contains one element `n`. After appending, `numbers` will contain two elements, both of which are `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `n`.**
