The code snippet creates a new list `sum_values` with a length of `max(numbers) + 1` and initializes all its elements to 0. This operation does not affect the existing variables `t`, `numbers`, and `values`. The new list `sum_values` is introduced with all elements set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
