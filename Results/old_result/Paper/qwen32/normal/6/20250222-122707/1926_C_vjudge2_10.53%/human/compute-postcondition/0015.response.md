The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop iterates over the range from 0 to 9 (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will execute as long as the range is valid, which it is by default since `range(10)` is always valid and will execute 10 times regardless of the other variables.

However, since the task specifies to only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and `i` is the only object in the loop head, there is no need to adjust any other variables (`t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, `total`) for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
