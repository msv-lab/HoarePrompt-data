Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer.**

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains the same input integer representing the number of test cases, and `numbers` is a list that contains `t` elements, where each element is an integer input during each iteration of the loop.
