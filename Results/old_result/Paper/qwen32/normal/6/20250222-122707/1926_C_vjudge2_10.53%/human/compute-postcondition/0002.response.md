The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use, so we don't need to adjust its value explicitly before the loop starts.

Since `numbers` is an empty list and it is not part of the loop head, we do not need to adjust it for the loop to execute. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is an empty list**
