Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `total` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(10):
    values[i] = i
    total += i
    sum_values[i] = total


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element initialized to 0 and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element set to 0 and all other elements initialized to 0, `total` is 0, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with `values[1]` set to 1 and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element set to 0 and all other elements initialized to 0 except `sum_values[1]` which is set to 1, `total` is 1, `i` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `numbers` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being an input integer, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with `values[1]` set to 1, `values[2]` set to 2, and all other elements initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the first element set to 0, `sum_values[1]` set to 1, and `sum_values[2]` set to 3, `total` is 3, `i` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
