Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect. Specifically:

1. The variable `n` used in the loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):` is not defined within the scope of that loop. The variable `n` is defined inside the `for _ in range(t):` loop, but it is not accessible outside that loop. This would result in a `NameError`.

2. The `sum_values` array is being updated with a variable `sum_total` that is not defined. It should be `sum_values[i] = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`.

3. The `values` and `sum_values` arrays are initialized with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`, which is correct, but the loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):` should iterate up to `max(numbers) + 1` instead of `n + 1` to avoid potential `IndexError`.

4. The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which would result in a `NameError`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[-1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_values[i] = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

This corrected version should work as expected.
