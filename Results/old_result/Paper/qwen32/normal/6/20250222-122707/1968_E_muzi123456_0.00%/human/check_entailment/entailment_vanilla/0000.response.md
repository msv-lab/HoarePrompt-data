Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem by selecting n points in an n x n grid in such a way that it maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances, \(\mathcal{H}\). 

However, the provided program does not achieve this goal. Instead of selecting points that maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances, it simply selects points along the first row of the grid, i.e., (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,n). This selection results in a very limited set of Manhattan distances, primarily just 0 (for the distance between a point and itself) and values from 1 to n-1 (for the distances between points on the same row).

For example, for n=3, the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) in this case is {0, 1, 2}, which is not optimal. The optimal solution for n=3, as shown in the problem statement, is:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
which results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **False**
