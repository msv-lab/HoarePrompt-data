Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The program simply prints points in the first row of the grid, which will result in only one distinct Manhattan distance (0 for pairs of the same point and 1 for adjacent points in the same row), far from maximizing the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be strategically placed to create a wide variety of Manhattan distances. For example, placing points in a diagonal or a zigzag pattern can help achieve this.
