Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem by printing points in a grid that are supposed to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. However, the current implementation does not achieve the goal of maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) as described in the problem statement.

The program always places all points in the first row of the grid, specifically at positions (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,n). This results in all Manhattan distances being either 0 (for the same point) or a value between 1 and n-1 (for different points in the same row). Therefore, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain at most n distinct values, which is not optimal.

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be strategically placed in the grid to cover a wider range of Manhattan distances. The examples provided in the problem statement show how points can be placed to achieve a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, for n=3, an optimal arrangement is (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), which results in the set \(\mathcal{H}\) = {0, 1, 2, 3}.

Since the current program does not achieve the goal of maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
