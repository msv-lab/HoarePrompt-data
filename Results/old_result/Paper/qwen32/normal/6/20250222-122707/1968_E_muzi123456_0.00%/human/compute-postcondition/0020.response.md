Let's break down the given initial state and analyze the print statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1` (must be greater than 0): This means that `t` has been decremented by 1 and is guaranteed to be greater than 0. However, the exact value of `t` is not specified.
- `n` must be at least 1: This means `n` is an integer and is at least 1. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified.
- `i` is 1: This means the variable `i` is explicitly set to the value 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given that `i` is explicitly set to 1, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
