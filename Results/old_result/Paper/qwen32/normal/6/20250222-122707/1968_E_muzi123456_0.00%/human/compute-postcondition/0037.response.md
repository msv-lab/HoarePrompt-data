Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is `t - 1`: This implies that `t` is being decremented by 1, but the initial value of `t` is not provided.
2. `n` must be greater than or equal to 2: This sets a condition on the value of `n`, but it does not provide the exact value of `n`.
3. `i` is 2: This explicitly sets the value of `i` to 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2 as per the initial state.
- The value of `t` and `n` are not used in the print statement, so they do not affect the output.
- The print statement `print(i)` will output the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is explicitly set to 2, the print statement will output the value 2.

Output: **2**
