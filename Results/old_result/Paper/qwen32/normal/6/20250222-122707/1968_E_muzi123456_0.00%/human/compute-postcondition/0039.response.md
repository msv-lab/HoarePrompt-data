The given initial state describes the values and conditions of certain variables, but the `print` statement provided does not use any of these variables. The `print` statement simply prints the string `'1'` followed by a space, as specified by the `end=' '` argument.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Information:**
   - `t` is `t - 1` (This doesn't affect the print statement as `t` is not used).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (This condition does not affect the print statement as `n` is not used).
   - `i` is 3 (This does not affect the print statement as `i` is not used).

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is `print('1', end=' ')`.
   - `'1'` is the string that will be printed.
   - `end=' '` specifies that a space will be printed after the string `'1'` instead of the default newline character.

Based on the above analysis, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **1 ** (where the output is the string `'1'` followed by a space)
