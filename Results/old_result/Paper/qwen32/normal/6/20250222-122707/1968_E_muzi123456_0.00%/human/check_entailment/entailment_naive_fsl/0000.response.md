Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The task is to choose n cells in an n x n grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized. The provided program simply prints points along the first row of the grid, which does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider the case when n = 3. The program would output:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set of distinct Manhattan distances for these points is:
- Distance between (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1
- Distance between (1,1) and (1,3): |1-1| + |1-3| = 2
- Distance between (1,2) and (1,3): |1-1| + |2-3| = 1

So, the set of distinct Manhattan distances is {0, 1, 2}. However, as shown in the example in the problem description, a better arrangement would be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
The set of distinct Manhattan distances for these points is:
- Distance between (2,1) and (2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 2
- Distance between (2,1) and (3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1
- Distance between (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 3

So, the set of distinct Manhattan distances is {0, 1, 2, 3}, which is larger than the previous set. Therefore, the provided program does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all cases.
