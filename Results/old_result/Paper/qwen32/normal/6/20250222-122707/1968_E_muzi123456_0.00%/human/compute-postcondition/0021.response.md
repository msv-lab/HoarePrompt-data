The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range defined by `1` and `n + 1`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since `i` is the loop variable and `range(1, n + 1)` will provide the next value). Therefore, `i` should be 2 for the next iteration to occur, and `n` must still be at least 1.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` (must be greater than 0), `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2**
