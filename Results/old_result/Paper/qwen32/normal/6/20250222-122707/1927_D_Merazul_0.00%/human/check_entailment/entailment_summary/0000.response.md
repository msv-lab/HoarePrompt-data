Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem involves queries on subarrays to find two different elements within a specified range. However, the given program seems to be checking something entirely different related to two sets of integers and an integer `k`. It is not performing any operations on subarrays or queries as specified in the problem statement.

The program reads input, processes it in a way that doesn't align with the problem requirements, and outputs "YES" or "NO" based on conditions that are not relevant to the problem. The expected output is pairs of indices or `-1 -1` for each query, not "YES" or "NO".

Correctness: **False**
