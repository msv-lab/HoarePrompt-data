### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided Python program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to handle multiple test cases.
- For each test case, we are given an array `a` and a series of queries.
- Each query specifies a range `[l, r]` within the array.
- For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `a[i] != a[j]` within the range `[l, r]`.
- If such a pair exists, print the indices `i` and `j`; otherwise, print `-1 -1`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (*_, k) = R()
        a = {*R()}
        b = {*R()}
        f = 1
        m = n = k // 2
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases correctly.
   - For each test case, it reads the array length `n` and the array elements.
   - However, it incorrectly reads the number of queries and the queries themselves as if they were part of the array elements.
   - The code does not correctly parse the queries.

2. **Logic**:
   - The code uses set operations to check the presence of integers from 1 to `k` in sets `a` and `b`.
   - The function summary suggests that the code checks if every integer from 1 to `k` is present in at least one of the sets and ensures that the counts of integers unique to each set do not exceed half of `k`.
   - This logic is not aligned with the problem requirements, which involve checking for distinct elements within a specified subarray range.

3. **Output**:
   - The code prints 'Y' or 'N' based on some conditions, but the problem requires printing indices of two distinct elements or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

#### Correct Implementation Approach:
- For each test case, parse the array and the queries correctly.
- For each query, check the subarray `[l, r]` for two distinct elements.
- If such a pair exists, print the indices; otherwise, print `-1 -1`.

#### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The input parsing, logic, and output do not match the problem requirements.

### Final: **False**
