The loop head in the provided `for` loop statement is `i` and `k`. Since `k` is not modified within the loop, the only variable that needs adjustment is `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have taken a value from `1` to `k` (inclusive), and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by `1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Let's consider the state adjustments step by step:
- If `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `2` at the start of the next iteration.
- If `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, it should be `3` at the start of the next iteration.
- This pattern continues until `i` reaches `k`, after which the loop will terminate.

Since we are not given the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `i` should be incremented by `1` to start the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged**.

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev + 1`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can represent the state as:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains unchanged**

However, to be more precise and in line with the provided format, we can state:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same**

Given the options and the need to specify the state clearly, the final state can be represented as:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged**

For the sake of clarity and exactness in the format provided:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains unchanged**

Since we don't have the exact value of `i`, the most accurate representation is:
State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same**

However, to match the format of the previous examples:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains unchanged**

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same**
