The code snippet `b = {*R()}` reads a line of input using the lambda function `R`, splits it into components, maps each component to an integer, and then converts the resulting list into a set, assigning it to `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, and `k` are not affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `t` is greater than 0 and is decreased by 1, `n` is an integer within a specific range, `a` is a set of integers, `q` is an integer within a specific range, and `k` is the last value read from the input by `R()`. The new variable `b` will be a set of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a set of integers read from the input; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `R` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it into components, and maps each component to an integer; `k` is the last value read from the input by `R()`, and `b` is a set of integers read from the input.**
