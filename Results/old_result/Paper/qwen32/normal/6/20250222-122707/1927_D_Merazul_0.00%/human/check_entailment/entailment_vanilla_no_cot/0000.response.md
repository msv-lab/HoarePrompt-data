Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to set intersections and unions, rather than finding pairs of distinct elements within specified ranges of an array. 

The correct approach for the given problem involves processing each query to check if there are at least two distinct elements within the specified range of the array. Hereâ€™s a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        queries = []
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, data[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            queries.append((l, r))
        
        for l, r in queries:
            found = False
            subarray = a[l - 1:r]
            seen = set()
            for i, val in enumerate(subarray):
                if val in seen:
                    continue
                for j in range(i + 1, len(subarray)):
                    if val != subarray[j]:
                        results.append(f"{l + i} {l + j}")
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

func()
```

This implementation reads the input, processes each test case, and checks for each query if there are two distinct elements within the specified range. If such a pair is found, it records the indices; otherwise, it records `-1 -1`.
