The code snippet `u = i in a` checks if the value of `i` is present in the list `a`. The value of `u` will be a boolean (`True` or `False`) depending on whether `i` is found in `a`.

Given the initial state, `i` is `i + 1`, which indicates that `i` has been incremented by 1 previously. The variable `k` remains unchanged.

The output state will include the updated value of `u` based on the membership test, while `i` and `k` will retain their states as described.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same, `u` is `True` if `i + 1` is in `a`, otherwise `u` is `False`.**
