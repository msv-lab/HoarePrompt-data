### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts can be perfectly divided into groups of three. If not, it checks if the remainder of extroverts (when divided by 3) plus the number of universals is at least 3, which would allow filling the remaining spots in the last tent.
   - If the above conditions are not met, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to form valid tents for extroverts and universals.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed by taking the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required for all participants.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate extroverts and universals according to the rules, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (who each need their own tent) to the number of tents returned by `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

### Validation Against Problem Description:
- **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of tents for introverts is simply the number of introverts.
- **Extroverts**: Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. Therefore, the number of extroverts must be divisible by 3 or can be adjusted with the help of universals.
- **Universals**: Universals are flexible and can fit into any configuration. They can be used to fill up the remaining spots in tents with extroverts or can form their own tents.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required while respecting the preferences of introverts, extroverts, and universals. If it's impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences, it returns -1.

**Correctness: True**
