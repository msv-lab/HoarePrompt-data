You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

test_case_n = int(input())
for _ in range(test_case_n):
    (introverts, extroverts, universals) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    print(func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: extroverts is a non-negative integer, universals is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :
        if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :
            return None
            #The program returns None
        #State: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, `universals` is a non-negative integer, `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is 3 or more.
    #State: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, `universals` is a non-negative integer. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is 3 or more.
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    #The program returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`. It returns `None` if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: introverts, extroverts, and universals are non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals respectively.
def func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals):
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
    #The program returns -1 if the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)` is `None`, otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three non-negative integer parameters representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It returns -1 if a helper function `func_1` returns `None` when called with the extroverts and universals as arguments; otherwise, it returns the sum of the introverts and the value returned by `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the possibility that there are not enough universals to fulfill the requirements of the extroverts when the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3. Additionally, `func_2` does not handle the scenario where the number of introverts exceeds the number of available tents.

Let's consider a specific test case:

**Test Case:**
```
1
2 1 0
```

**Explanation of the Test Case:**
- There are 2 introverts, 1 extrovert, and 0 universals.
- Each introvert needs a tent alone, so 2 tents are needed for the introverts.
- The extrovert needs a tent with 2 others, but there are no universals available, so it is impossible to accommodate the extrovert's preference.

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
1
```

The program incorrectly returns `1` because `func_1` does not return `None` in this case, and `func_2` adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` without checking if it is possible to accommodate the extroverts.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
