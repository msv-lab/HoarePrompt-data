To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the function call `ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)`. Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only assume that `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments and returns some value, which is then assigned to the variable `ret`.

Given that the initial state includes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as non-negative integers, and the function call does not modify `introverts` or `extroverts` directly, their values remain unchanged. The variable `ret` will hold the value returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer, `universals` is a non-negative integer, `ret` is the value returned by `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**.
