### Reasoning:

The original assessment thoroughly analyzed the problem requirements and the provided program code. It correctly identified the roles of the two functions and how they contribute to solving the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure there are no overlooked details:

1. **Problem Requirements Recap**:
   - **Introverts (a)**: Each introvert needs a tent alone.
   - **Extroverts (b)**: Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - **Universals (c)**: Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

2. **Function Analysis Recap**:
   - **Function `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**:
     - Handles the accommodation of extroverts and universals.
     - If the number of extroverts modulo 3 is not zero, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form a tent.
     - If not possible, it returns `None`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates and returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3.
   - **Function `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**:
     - Calls `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (one tent per introvert) to the result from `func_1`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The original assessment verified the program with multiple test cases, ensuring that the logic holds for different scenarios.
   - Each test case was correctly analyzed, and the results matched the expected output.

### Detailed Verification:

Let's revisit the logic of `func_1` to ensure it correctly handles all edge cases:

- **Case 1**: `extroverts % 3 == 0`
  - All extroverts can be perfectly grouped into tents of 3.
  - The function correctly returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
  
- **Case 2**: `extroverts % 3 != 0`
  - If the remaining extroverts plus the universals are less than 3, it is impossible to form a tent.
  - The function correctly returns `None` in this case.
  - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents needed, ensuring that all extroverts and universals are accommodated.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly analyzed the problem and the provided code. All test cases were handled appropriately, and the logic of the functions was verified to be correct. The program adheres to the problem requirements and handles all edge cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
