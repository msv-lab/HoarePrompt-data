The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides a description of several variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is not dependent on the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```
2. The string `'YES'` is explicitly provided in the `print` statement.
3. The variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not referenced in the `print` statement.
4. Since the `print` statement does not use any variables, the output will always be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
