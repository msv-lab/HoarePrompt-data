Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is greater than 0 and `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of user input. If `n` is 2, then if `s` is the string '00', `s` remains '00'. Otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, it remains odd. If `count_1` is even, it remains even, and the string `s` either has exactly one occurrence of the substring "11" or does not have exactly one occurrence of "11".
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 1 (since it was at least 2 initially and is decremented by 1); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the user input. If `n` is 2, then `s` remains '00' if it was '00', otherwise `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not 2, `count_1` retains its parity (odd or even) and the string `s` either has exactly one occurrence of the substring "11" or does not have exactly one occurrence of "11". `count_1` is the number of '1's in `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 1 minus 1; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the value of the user input. If `n` is 2, then `s` remains '00' if it was '00', otherwise `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not 2, the string `s` either has exactly one occurrence of the substring "11" or does not have exactly one occurrence of "11", and `count_1` retains its parity (odd or even).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
