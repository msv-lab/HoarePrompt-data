Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is at least 1; `n` is the input integer; `s` is the value of the user input; if `n` is 2, `s` remains '00' if it was '00', otherwise `s` is not equal to '00'; if `n` is not 2, the string `s` either has exactly one occurrence of the substring "11" or does not have exactly one occurrence of "11"; `count_1` is the number of '1's in `s`.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block, the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` retain their original properties and constraints as described in the precondition, regardless of whether the condition `s.count('11') == 1` is true or false.
