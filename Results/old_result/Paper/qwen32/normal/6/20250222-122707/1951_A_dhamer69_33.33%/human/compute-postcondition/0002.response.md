Output State: **`start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**

In simple terms, the output state is that `start` and `end` remain as integers with the condition `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is still greater than 0, and `n` is assigned the value of an input integer.
