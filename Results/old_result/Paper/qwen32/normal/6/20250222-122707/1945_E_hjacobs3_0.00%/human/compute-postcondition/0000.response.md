The code snippet assigns the variable `n` the value of the length of the list `array`. The initial state specifies that `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, and `find` is an integer that exists in the array.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`.**
