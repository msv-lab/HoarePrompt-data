The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print(1)` statement. The initial state describes the variables `l` and `r` and their relationship to the `find` value in an array, but it does not affect the execution of the `print(1)` statement. The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, or `find`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(1)` statement is simply `1`.

Output: **1**
