### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by performing a binary search on the permutation array to find the index of the number `x`. However, the array is not sorted, and the binary search algorithm requires a sorted array to function correctly. The program tries to make the array suitable for binary search by performing at most two swaps.

The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the necessary swaps to make the binary search return the correct index of `x`. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_1` is incorrect. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` is not suitable for finding the exact index of `x` in an unsorted array. This condition is typically used in a sorted array to narrow down the search space.

2. **Incorrect Check for Index**: The check `if (l != array.index(find))` is flawed. The variable `l` is supposed to represent the position where `x` should be found after sorting, but the actual index of `x` in the unsorted array might not be directly comparable to `l` in this context. The logic does not account for the need to sort the array or make it partially sorted to ensure the binary search works correctly.

3. **Output Format**: The output format does not match the problem's requirements. The problem requires the number of operations followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped. The current implementation does not correctly format the output.

4. **Lack of Sorting Strategy**: The function does not implement any strategy to sort the array or make it suitable for binary search by performing at most two swaps.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. It does not sort the array or make it suitable for binary search, and the output format is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
