The code snippet `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` by setting it to `mid + 1`. The values of `array`, `find`, `n`, and `mid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`, `l` is `mid + 1`.**
