The code snippet calculates the midpoint `mid` between two indices `l` and `r`. The values of `l` and `r` are not provided, but we know `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. The value of `mid` is computed as the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `mid` is `(l + r) // 2`.**
