Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap:
We need to manipulate a permutation list `p` of size `n` such that after performing at most 2 swaps, a binary search for a given number `x` will result in `p[l]` being equal to `x` after the search. The binary search is performed on the list `p` without sorting it.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the permutation) and `x` (the number to find).
   - It then reads the permutation list `array`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is implemented in the function `func_1`.
   - The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to `0` and `n-1` respectively.
   - The binary search loop continues until `l` is greater than `r`.
   - The middle index `mid` is calculated as `(l + r) // 2`.
   - Depending on whether the middle element `array[mid]` is less than or greater than `x`, the search range is adjusted by modifying `l` and `r`.

3. **Checking the Result:**
   - After the binary search, the program checks if `l` is equal to the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `l` is not equal to the index of `x`, it prints `1` and suggests a swap between `l` and the index of `x`.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `x`, it prints `0`, indicating no swap is needed.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Binary Search Logic:**
  - The binary search logic is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the array is not sorted. The binary search algorithm requires a sorted array to function correctly.
  
- **Incorrect Index Handling:**
  - The program uses `array.index(find)` to determine the position of `x` in the array. This is not guaranteed to be correct after the binary search, especially if the array is not sorted.
  
- **Output Format:**
  - The program prints `1` and the swap indices directly from `func_1`, which is not the correct approach as per the problem statement. The problem expects the number of swaps followed by the swap indices on separate lines.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the binary search logic and the incorrect handling of the output format, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It uses an incorrect binary search approach and does not handle the output format as required.
