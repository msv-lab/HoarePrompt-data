### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem by ensuring that the binary search algorithm will correctly identify the index of the number `x` in the permutation `p` after performing at most 2 swaps. However, there are several issues with the current implementation that make it incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Implementation Error**:
   - The binary search in the code is not correctly implemented. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` should be `if array[mid] < find` to correctly find the position where `find` should be located.
   - The loop condition `while l <= r` should be `while l < r` to avoid unnecessary comparisons and to correctly identify the position.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**:
   - The code only handles the case where a single swap is needed if the binary search does not find `x` at the correct position. However, the problem requires us to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search, which might need up to 2 swaps.
   - The current code does not consider the possibility of performing a second swap if the first swap does not lead to the correct result.

3. **Incorrect Output Format**:
   - The code prints the number of swaps and the swap operations directly inside the function `func_1`, which is not the correct approach. The function should return the operations as a list of strings, and the main loop should handle the printing.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, the current implementation is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is:

**Correctness: False**
