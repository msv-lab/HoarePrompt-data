The code snippet initializes two variables `l` and `r` with the values `0` and `n - 1`, respectively. The variable `n` represents the length of the list `array`, and `find` is an integer that exists in the array. The values of `array`, `find`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**
