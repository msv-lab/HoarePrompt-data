You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that exists in the array. The sum of the lengths of all permutations across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: `l` is the smallest index such that all elements before `l` are less than `find`, and `r` is the largest index such that all elements after `r` are greater than or equal to `find`. If `find` exists in the array, `l` will be equal to `r + 1` and point to the position just after the last element less than `find`. If `find` does not exist in the array, `l` will be equal to `r + 1` and point to the position where `find` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two string elements. The first element is the string representation of `l + 1`, and the second element is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus one.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `l` is the smallest index such that all elements before `l` are less than `find`, and `r` is the largest index such that all elements after `r` are greater than or equal to `find`. If `find` exists in the array, `l` will be equal to `r + 1` and point to the position just after the last element less than `find`. If `find` does not exist in the array, `l` will be equal to `r + 1` and point to the position where `find` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order. Additionally, `l` is equal to the index of `find` in the array.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer existing in the array. The function returns a list containing two string elements: the first element is the string representation of `l + 1` (where `l` is the index of `find` in the array), and the second element is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus one.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing two string elements. The first element is the string representation of `l + 1`, and the second element is the string representation of the index of `find` in the array plus one.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
