Postcondition: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5), `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`) that exists in the array, `n` is the length of `array`. If `array[mid] >= find`, then `r` is updated to `(n - 1) // 2 - 1` and `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`. Otherwise, `l` is updated to `((l + r) // 2) + 1` and `mid` is recalculated as `(l + r) // 2`.**
