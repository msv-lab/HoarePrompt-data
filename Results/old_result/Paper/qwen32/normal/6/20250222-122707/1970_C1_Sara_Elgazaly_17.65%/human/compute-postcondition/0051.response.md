Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is a node, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` has one less element than before, and `s` is False. If `lst[y]` is not empty, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
