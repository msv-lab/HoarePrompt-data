The provided code snippet reads a pair of integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state indicates that `lst` is a defaultdict of lists that stores the adjacency list representation of a tree. After reading the input, the code does not modify any existing variables other than assigning the new values to `a` and `b`. The initial state of the tree and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 3, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` containing `b` and `lst[b]` containing `a`, `a` and `b` are the two integers read from the input.**
