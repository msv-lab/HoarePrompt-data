The code snippet `y = lst[x].pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `lst[x]` and assigns it to the variable `y`. Since `lst[x]` initially has at least one element, `y` will be assigned that element, and `lst[x]` will have one less element after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is a leaf node, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists where `lst[x]` has one less element than before, `s` is False**.

In simpler terms, `y` is now the last element that was in `lst[x]`, and `lst[x]` has one less element compared to its initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
