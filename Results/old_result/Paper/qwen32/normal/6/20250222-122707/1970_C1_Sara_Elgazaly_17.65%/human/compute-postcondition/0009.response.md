Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves, the last line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t with 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round, `x` is an integer such that x ≥ 3, `y` is assigned the value of the other integer read from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists with `lst[a]` containing `b` and `lst[b]` containing `a` and now `lst[b]` includes `a` as an additional element.**

In simpler terms, the output state is that `n`, `t`, the tree structure, the starting node `u_1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `lst[b]` now includes `a` as an additional element, meaning the adjacency list for node `b` now has `a` added to it.
