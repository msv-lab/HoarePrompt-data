The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, `lst[x]`, `s`, and the condition `x` is now equal to `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `lst[x]` has one less element than before, `s` is True, and `x` is now equal to `y`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
