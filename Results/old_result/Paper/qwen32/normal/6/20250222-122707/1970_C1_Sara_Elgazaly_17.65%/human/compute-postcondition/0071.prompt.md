Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is the starting node `u_1`, `y` is the last node visited before `lst[x]` became empty, `lst[x]` must be a non-empty list, `s` is True
Code of the loop:
while lst[x]:
    y = lst[x].pop()
    if lst[y] != []:
        x = y
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` before it was popped, `lst[x]` is a list with one less element than before, `s` is True, and `lst[y]` is not an empty list if the if condition is met. If `lst[y]` is an empty list, the else part does not execute, and the state remains as described except for the condition on `lst[y]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `lst[x]` has one less element than before, and `s` is True. If `lst[y]` is not an empty list, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `lst[y]` is an empty list, the state remains as described except for the condition on `lst[y]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `x` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after it was popped, `lst[x]` has one less element than before, and `s` is True. If `lst[y]` is not empty, `x` is now equal to `y` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
