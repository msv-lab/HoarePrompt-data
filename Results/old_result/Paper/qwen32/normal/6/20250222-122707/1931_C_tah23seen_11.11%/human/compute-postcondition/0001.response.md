The code snippet assigns the variable `j` the value of `len(arr) - 1`. This means `j` is set to the index of the last element in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are `n` integers following it. The variable `i` is 0 and is not affected by the code snippet.

The length of `arr` can be calculated as follows:
- The first element `t` represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, there is one integer `n` followed by `n` integers.

Therefore, the length of `arr` is `1 + 2 * sum(n)` where `n` is the number of elements for each test case.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) is followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`) representing the elements of the array. `i` is 0. `j` is `len(arr) - 1`.**
