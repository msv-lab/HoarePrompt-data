To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the loop. The loop compares elements from the beginning (`arr[i]`) and the end (`arr[j]`) of the array and moves the indices inward if the elements are equal. If the elements are not equal, the loop breaks.

Given the initial state and the described behavior, here's the final state after the loop completes:

- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i <= j` and `arr[i] == arr[j]`.
- Once `arr[i] != arr[j]` or `i > j`, the loop terminates.

### Output State:
- `i` will be the first index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` or `i` will be greater than `j`.
- `j` will be the last index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[j]` or `j` will be less than `i`.

### Natural Language Description:
The loop will continue to increment `i` and decrement `j` as long as the elements at these indices are equal. When the elements at `i` and `j` differ, or when `i` surpasses `j`, the loop stops. The final state will have `i` and `j` such that either `arr[i] != arr[j]` or `i > j`.

### Example:
Let's take an example to illustrate this:
- Initial State: `arr = [3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3]`, `i = 0`, `j = 5`
- After 1st iteration: `arr[0] == arr[5]`, so `i = 1`, `j = 4`
- After 2nd iteration: `arr[1] == arr[4]`, so `i = 2`, `j = 3`
- After 3rd iteration: `arr[2] != arr[3]`, so the loop breaks.

Final Output State: `i = 2`, `j = 3`.

Output State: **`i = 2`, `j = 3`**.

However, since the exact final state depends on the input array, the general description of the final state is:

Output State: **`i` and `j` such that either `arr[i] != arr[j]` or `i > j`.**
