To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it modifies the variable `i`. The loop increments `i` as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Given the initial state and the states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer that `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[i + 1]` for at least 3 consecutive iterations, and `i` was incremented each time this condition was true.

The loop will continue to execute as long as `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`. Therefore, the final output state will be the point where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Let's summarize the final state:
- `i` will be incremented until `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`.
- `j` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

Thus, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`i` is a valid index such that `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `j` remains unchanged.**

In natural language: The final state is when `i` points to an element in the array that is not equal to the next element, and `j` retains its initial value.
