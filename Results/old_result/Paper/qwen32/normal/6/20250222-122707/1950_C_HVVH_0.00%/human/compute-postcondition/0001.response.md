The code snippet provided assigns an integer value to the variable `n` by converting the input to an integer. The variables `t`, `s`, and `day` are not affected by this code snippet. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within a specific range, and `s` and `day` are defined for each of the `t` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59; `day` is 'AM'; `n` is an input integer.**
