To determine the output of the given print statement, we need to analyze the variables and their values based on the initial state provided.

1. **Variable `h`:**
   - `h` is an integer representing the hours read from the input.
   - It is adjusted to be between 1 and 12 if necessary.
   - If the original `h` is 0, it is adjusted to 12.
   - If the original `h` is greater than 12, it is adjusted to `h - 12`.
   - If the original `h` is between 1 and 12 (inclusive), it remains unchanged.

2. **Variable `m`:**
   - `m` is an integer representing the minutes read from the input.
   - It is not adjusted and remains the same as the input.

3. **Variable `day`:**
   - `day` is a string that is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - It is 'AM' if the original `h` was 0 or 12.
   - It is 'PM' if the original `h` was greater than 12.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement formats `h` and `m` to always be two digits (e.g., `01` instead of `1`).
   - It then prints the formatted time along with the `day` string.

Given these details, the output will be a time in 12-hour format (hh:mm) followed by either 'AM' or 'PM'.

### Explanation of the Output:
- The time will be displayed in the format `hh:mm` where `hh` is always two digits and `mm` is always two digits.
- The `day` will be either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the original hour value `h`.

### Example:
- If the original `h` is 13 and `m` is 45, `h` will be adjusted to 1, and `day` will be 'PM'.
- The output will be `01:45 PM`.

### General Case:
- The output will be in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` where `hh` and `mm` are adjusted as described above.

Output: **`hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` (where `hh` is the adjusted hour between 01 and 12, `mm` is the minutes, and `AM` or `PM` is the day period based on the original hour)**
