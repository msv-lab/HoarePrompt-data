Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59; `h` is the hour read from the input minus 12 if the original `h` was greater than 12, otherwise `h` is 12 if the original `h` was 0, or remains the same otherwise; `m` is the minute read from the input, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n + 1`, `day` is 'AM' if the original `h` was 0 or 12, and 'PM' if the original `h` was greater than 12.**
