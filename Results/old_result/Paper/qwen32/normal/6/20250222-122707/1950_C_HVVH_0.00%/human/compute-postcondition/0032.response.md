The given code snippet reads a string representing a time in 24-hour format and splits it into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`). The initial state specifies that `h` and `m` are integers representing the hours and minutes of a given time, respectively. The code does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `day` directly but updates `h` and `m` based on the input.

Given that the input format is `hh:mm`, the values of `h` and `m` will be updated to reflect the hours and minutes read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, for each of the t test cases, there is a string `s` of length 5 representing a valid time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) where 00 <= hh <= 23 and 00 <= mm <= 59; `h` is the hour read from the input, `m` is the minute read from the input, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n + 1`, `day` is 'AM' if the original `h` was 0 or 12, and 'PM' if the original `h` was greater than 12.**
