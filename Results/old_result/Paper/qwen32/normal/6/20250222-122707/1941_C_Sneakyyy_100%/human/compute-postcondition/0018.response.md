Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string entered by the user with length at least 6 if `i` was 3, otherwise `a` has a length at least 3, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6 if the original `i` was 3, otherwise `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, and `i` is 2 if the original `i` was 1, otherwise `i` is 4.**

To simplify:
Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with a length of at least 6 if `i` was 3, otherwise at least 3, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6 if originally `i` was 3, otherwise `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2 if originally `i` was 1, otherwise `i` is 4.**
