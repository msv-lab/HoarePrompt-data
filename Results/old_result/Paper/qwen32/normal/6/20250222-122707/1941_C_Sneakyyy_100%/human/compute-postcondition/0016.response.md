The code snippet `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the incremented value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string entered by the user with length at least 6 if `i` was 3, otherwise `a` has a length at least 3, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `ans` is 2 if the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1, `i` is 6 if the original `i` was 3, otherwise `i` is 4.**
