The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` is either 0 or 1 initially, after the operation, `ans` will be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with length greater than 5, `i` is 5, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `s` is the substring of `a` from index 2 to 5**.
