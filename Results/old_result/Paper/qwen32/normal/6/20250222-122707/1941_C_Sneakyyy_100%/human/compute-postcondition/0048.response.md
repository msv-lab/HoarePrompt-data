The code snippet `i += 3` increments the value of `i` by 3. The previous value of `i` was either 4 (if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie') or 2 (otherwise). Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 7 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', and 5 otherwise.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is a list of integers with at least 6 characters, `s` is `a[4:7]` if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `s` is `a[2:5]`, `i` is 7 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 5, `ans` is 2 if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0.**
