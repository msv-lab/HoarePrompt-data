Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the integer value from user input, `a` is a list of integers with at least 6 characters, `s` is `a[3:6]` if the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `s` is `a[1:4]`. If the initial `s` was 'map' or 'pie', `i` is 6 and `ans` is 2. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `ans` is 0.**
