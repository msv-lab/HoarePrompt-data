### Reasoning:
The given program aims to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters that form the substrings "pie" or "map". The approach taken by the program is to iterate through the string and check for these substrings. If it finds "pie" or "map", it skips the next three characters (since the substrings are of length 3) and increments the count of deletions. This method assumes that removing these exact substrings will make the string beautiful, which is correct in the context of the problem.

However, the code has a flaw: it only counts non-overlapping occurrences of "pie" or "map". For example, in the string "ppieiepie", the current code would only count one occurrence of "pie" and skip the second one because it moves the index forward by 3 when it finds a match. This means it does not correctly handle overlapping or consecutive occurrences of the substrings "pie" or "map".

To correctly solve the problem, the code should consider overlapping occurrences and ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated. The current implementation does not achieve this because it skips over potential overlapping matches by incrementing the index by 3.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not always compute the correct minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
