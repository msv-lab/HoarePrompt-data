In the given for loop, the loop head only contains the variable `_` and `t`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in Python when the loop variable is not needed. The loop will continue to execute as long as the range function generates values up to `t`. Since `t` is the controlling factor for the loop's continuation, we need to adjust `t` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0. Since the loop iterates `t` times, after each iteration, the loop control variable (which is not explicitly named but is `_` in this case) is incremented by 1 implicitly by the `range` function. Therefore, to execute one more iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

However, since the loop head does not modify `t` directly and the loop will naturally decrement the internal counter, we only need to ensure that `t` is still greater than 0 for the loop to continue. Given that `t` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should remain as it is because the loop itself will handle the decrement.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is still greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called (though `func_1()` is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).

State: **`t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `func_1()` has been called**
