You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing a binary string. n is an integer initialized to 0, and ans is an integer initialized to 0.

            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` is the original binary list, `n` is the count of consecutive 1s at the end of the list (or 0 if the last element is 0), and `ans` is the total count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0 encountered in the list.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the total count of substrings of 1s ending at each 0 encountered in the list `s`)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all 0s followed by all 1s) using the minimum cost of cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of shifting a substring is defined as the length of that substring.

### Key Observations:
1. **Cyclic Shifts**: A cyclic shift of a substring can move a '1' to the left of a '0', effectively sorting the string.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
3. **Optimal Strategy**: To minimize the cost, we should aim to shift each '1' to the left of all '0's it needs to be to the right of. The optimal strategy involves counting the number of '1's encountered so far and adding the cost of shifting each '0' past these '1's.

### Code Analysis:
Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - Reads a binary string as a list of integers.
    - Initializes `n` (count of '1's encountered) and `ans` (total cost).
    - Iterates through the string:
        - Increments `n` for each '1'.
        - For each '0' encountered after at least one '1', adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
    - Prints the total cost `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - Reads the number of test cases.
    - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues in the Code:
- **Input Handling**: The input string is supposed to be a binary string, but `input().split()` is used, which would split the string into a list of substrings separated by spaces. This is incorrect for a binary string.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic seems correct based on the problem description, but the incorrect input handling will lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with input handling, the code does not correctly read the binary string, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
