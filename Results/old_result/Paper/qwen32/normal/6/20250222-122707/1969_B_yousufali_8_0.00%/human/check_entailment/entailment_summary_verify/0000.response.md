### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string to sort it in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's).
- The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
- We need to minimize the total cost.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.
   - `func_1` reads the binary string as a list of integers separated by spaces, which is incorrect. The problem specifies that the binary string is provided without spaces.

2. **Logic for Calculating Cost:**
   - `func_1` iterates through the string, counting the number of '1's (`n`) encountered before each '0'.
   - When a '0' is encountered and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).

#### Issues Identified:
- **Input Parsing:** The current implementation assumes the input is a space-separated list of integers, which is incorrect. The input is a binary string without spaces.
- **Cost Calculation Logic:** The logic of adding `n + 1` to the cost for each '0' encountered after '1's is flawed. It does not correctly account for the minimum cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. For example:
  - **Example 1:** For the input `1001`, the correct minimal cost is 3, but the code outputs 2.
  - **Example 2:** For the input `11000`, the correct minimal cost is 9, which the code correctly outputs, but this is not a general solution.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Read the binary string correctly.
- Determine the minimal cost to sort the string by cyclically shifting substrings. This involves more complex logic than simply counting '1's before '0's.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues with input parsing and the flawed logic for calculating the cost, the original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem for all possible cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
