The code snippet `ans += n + 1` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `n + 1`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `n` are not directly modified by this line of code but are part of the context. The precondition that `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element remains valid. The increment of `i` and the condition based on `s[i]` affecting `n` are also part of the context but are not directly changed by this line.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element; `i` is `i + 1`; if `s[i]` was 1, then `n` is `n + 1`; `ans` is increased by `n + 1`.**
