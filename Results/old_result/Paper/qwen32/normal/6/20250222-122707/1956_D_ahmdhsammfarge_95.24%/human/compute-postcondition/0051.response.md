Output State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `j` is less than `len(lst)`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain as they were in the initial state. The variable `sm` is newly assigned the value of the expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.
