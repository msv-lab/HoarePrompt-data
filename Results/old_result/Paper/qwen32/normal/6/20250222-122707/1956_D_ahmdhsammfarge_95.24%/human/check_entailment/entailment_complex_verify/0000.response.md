Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the original assessment to determine if the code correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array as described in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis

The goal is to maximize the sum of the array by replacing segments of the array with their MEX (Minimum EXcluded Value). The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set. The code should identify segments `[l, r]` that, when replaced with their MEX, will maximize the sum of the array.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function is supposed to find the optimal segment `[l, r]` to maximize the sum by replacing it with its MEX value. However, the function does not compute the MEX value. Instead, it calculates a sum based on the length of the segment squared:
```python
sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
```
This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to use the MEX value. The sum calculation here is incorrect and does not reflect the actual benefit of replacing the segment with its MEX value.

#### Function `func_2`
This function seems to be intended to perform recursive operations, but it does not correctly implement the logic to replace the segment with the MEX value. It only appends operations without actually modifying the array:
```python
func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
```
This function does not perform the MEX operation or update the array correctly.

#### Function `func_3`
This function is supposed to perform the replacement operation and update the array. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX value for the segment `[r, l]`. It simply fills the segment with the length of the segment, which is not the MEX value:
```python
n = l - r + 1
lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
```
This approach is incorrect because it does not compute the MEX value of the segment.

### Conclusion

The code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array as described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not correctly compute the MEX value or perform the necessary operations to replace segments with their MEX values. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
