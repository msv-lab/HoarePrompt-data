Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `over_sum` is `sm`**

In this output state, the values of `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain as per the initial conditions. The new variable `over_sum` is assigned the value of `sm`.
