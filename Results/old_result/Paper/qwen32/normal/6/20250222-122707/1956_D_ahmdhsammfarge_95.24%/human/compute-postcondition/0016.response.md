The code snippet assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variables `r` and `l` respectively. The initial values of `i` and `j` are 0 and 2. Therefore, `r` is updated to 0 and `l` is updated to 2. The other variables `lst`, `sm` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with more than 1 element; `i` is 0; `r` is 0; `j` is 2; `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`; `l` is 2.**
