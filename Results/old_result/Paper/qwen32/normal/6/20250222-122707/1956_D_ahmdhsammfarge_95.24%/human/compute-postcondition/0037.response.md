To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the given conditions step-by-step.

The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `len(lst)`, where `i` is initially set to `l + 1`. For each `j` in this range, it calculates a sum `sm` and checks if it is greater than `over_sum`. If it is, `r` and `l` are updated, and `over_sum` is set to `sm`.

Given the initial state and the states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **Initial State**: `r` is 0, `l` is the index `j` that maximizes `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`, `i` is `l + 1`.
2. **After 1st Iteration**: The loop runs once, and `l` is such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`. The values of `r`, `l`, `i`, and `sm` are updated if `sm > over_sum`.
3. **After 2nd Iteration**: The loop runs a second time, and `j` is incremented. The values of `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` are updated if `sm > over_sum`.
4. **After 3rd Iteration**: The loop runs a third time, and `j` is incremented again. The values of `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` are updated if `sm > over_sum`.

The loop continues until `j` reaches `len(lst)`. The final state of `r` and `l` will be the indices that maximize the expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.

Given that the loop runs until `j` reaches `len(lst)`, the final `l` will be the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the above expression over all possible `i` and `j`. The final `r` will be `l + 1` if such an update occurs, otherwise it remains 0.

Since the exact list `lst` is not provided, we can't compute the exact values of `r` and `l`. However, we can describe the final state in a general form.

**Output State: **`r` is the value of `i` (which is `l + 1`) that maximizes `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` for the final `j`, and `l` is the index `j` that achieves this maximum. `i` is `l + 1`, and `over_sum` is the maximum sum achieved.**

In simpler terms, the final output state is:

Output State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1` and `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression over all iterations.**
