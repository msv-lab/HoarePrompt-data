The given code snippet updates the value of `sm` based on the current values of `lst`, `i`, and `j`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the new value of `sm` is calculated as the sum of all elements in `lst` except the ones at index 0 and 1 (because `sum(lst[:i])` is `sum(lst[0:0])` which is 0, and `sum(lst[j + 1:])` is `sum(lst[3:])`), plus the square of `(j - i + 1)` which is `(2 - 0 + 1) ** 2 = 9`.

The initial value of `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`. This value is not relevant to the new calculation of `sm` in the code snippet, so it is replaced.

The other variables (`lst`, `i`, `r`, `j`, `over_sum`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with more than 1 element; `i` is 0; `r` is 0; `j` is 2; `sm` is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`.**
