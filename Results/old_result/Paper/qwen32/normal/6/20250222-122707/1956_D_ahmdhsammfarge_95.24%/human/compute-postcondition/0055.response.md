To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `over_sum` are updated. 

The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` to the end of the list `lst`. For each `j`, it calculates `sm` as the sum of elements before `i`, the sum of elements after `j`, and the square of the length of the segment from `i` to `j` inclusive. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, it updates `r` and `l` to `i` and `j` respectively, and updates `over_sum` to `sm`.

The loop continues until all possible `j` for the given `i` have been considered. After that, the loop will terminate if there are no more valid `i` values (i.e., when `i + 1` is no longer less than the length of the list).

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state will be when the loop has considered all possible values of `i` and `j` and has found the maximum `sm` over all iterations.

Here's the final output state in the specified format:

Output State: **`r` is the value of `l + 1`, `l` is the index that, along with `r`, maximizes the sum expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` over all iterations of the loop, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of this sum expression found.**

In simple terms, after the loop finishes, `r` and `l` will be the indices that give the maximum value for the specified sum expression, and `over_sum` will hold that maximum value.
