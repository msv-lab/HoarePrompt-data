Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `i` is such that `i + 1 < len(lst)`, `j` is `j + 1` and `j` is less than `len(lst)`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values except for the addition of `over_sum`, which is assigned the value of `sm`.
