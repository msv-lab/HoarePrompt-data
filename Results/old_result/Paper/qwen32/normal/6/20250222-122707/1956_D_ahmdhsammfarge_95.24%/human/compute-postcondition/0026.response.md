Postcondition: **`r` is 0, `l` is an index such that `l + 2 <= len(lst)`, `i` is `l + 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, and if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is updated to `i` and `l` is updated to `j` with `i` recalculated as `l + 1` and `sm` recalculated as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. Otherwise, `r`, `l`, `i`, and `sm` retain their initial values.**
