Let's systematically evaluate the program code and annotations to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Understanding

The goal is to maximize the sum of an array by repeatedly choosing a subarray and replacing all its elements with the MEX (minimum excluded non-negative integer) of that subarray. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set.

### Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
- **Purpose**: Find the best subarray `[l, r]` to replace with its MEX to maximize the sum.
- **Implementation**: The function calculates a potential sum `sm` based on the length of the subarray squared and updates `over_sum` if `sm` is greater. However, this is not the correct approach to maximize the sum because it does not consider the MEX value.
- **Annotation**: Correctly states that `r` and `l` are the indices that maximize the sum expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)^2`.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Purpose**: Perform recursive operations to update the list.
- **Implementation**: Recursively appends operations without actually modifying the array. This function does not correctly compute the MEX value.
- **Annotation**: Correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.

#### Function `func_3`
- **Purpose**: Perform the replacement operation and update the array.
- **Implementation**: Appends operations to `ops` and modifies the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` to be filled with the length of the sublist `n`. This does not compute the MEX value.
- **Annotation**: Correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.

### Overall Logic
The code does not correctly compute the MEX value for any subarray, which is a critical part of the problem. Instead, it fills the subarray with its length, which is not the MEX value. This is a significant flaw in the logic.

### Counterexample
Let's consider the counterexample provided in the original assessment:

**Input:**
```
3
1 3 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
13 0
```

**Actual Output:**
The provided code does not produce the correct output because it does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The code does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array as described in the problem statement. The critical issue is the incorrect computation of the MEX value.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
