### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotations systematically to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Function 1: `func_1`
This function is intended to find the optimal subarray `[i:j]` to replace with its MEX value. It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates a new sum based on the formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`.

The original assessment points out that the formula `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is incorrect because it does not represent the new sum after replacing the subarray with its MEX value. Instead, it should be the MEX value multiplied by the length of the subarray `(j - i + 1)`.

#### Function 2: `func_2`
This function is recursive and is supposed to generate a sequence of operations to replace a subarray `[r:l]` with its MEX value. However, the logic is not clear and seems to be appending operations without a clear rationale. The recursive calls and the operations appended do not seem to align with a clear strategy for achieving the goal.

#### Function 3: `func_3`
This function is supposed to perform the replacement of the subarray `[r:l]` with its MEX value, update the list, and generate the corresponding operations. However, the logic here is flawed. It appends operations without ensuring that the MEX value is correctly calculated or applied. Specifically, it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times without a clear purpose and does not correctly handle the MEX value.

#### Annotations
The annotations provide insights into the state of the program at key points, but they do not correct the logical flaws in the code. They describe the state transitions but do not address the incorrect assumptions in the sum calculation and the unclear logic in the operation generation.

#### Evaluation
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the new sum, generating operations, and replacing subarrays with their MEX values is flawed.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
