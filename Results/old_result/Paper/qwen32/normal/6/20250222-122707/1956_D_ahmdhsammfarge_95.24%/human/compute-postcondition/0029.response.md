The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `r` and the value of `j` to `l`. Therefore, `r` will now hold the value of `i`, and `l` will now hold the value of `j`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `i` is `l + 1`, `j` is incremented by 1, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**
