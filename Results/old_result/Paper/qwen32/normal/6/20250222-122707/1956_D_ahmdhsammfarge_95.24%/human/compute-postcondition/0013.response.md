Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with more than 1 element; `i` is 0; `r` is 0; `j` is 1; `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `l` is 1. Otherwise, `l` remains 0.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
