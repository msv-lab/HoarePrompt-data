You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

#Function 3:
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function modifies a given list `lst` by setting all elements in the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) to the length `n` of that sublist (`n = l - r + 1`). It also appends specific operations to the list `ops` and returns the modified list `lst`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. The goal of the program is to maximize the sum of an array by performing a series of operations, each of which replaces a subarray with its MEX (minimum excluded value). The program is supposed to output the maximum sum and a sequence of operations achieving this sum.

Let's break down the provided code and see if it correctly implements the solution:

### Function 1: `func_1`
This function is supposed to find the optimal subarray `[i:j]` to replace with its MEX. It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the new sum if that subarray is replaced by its MEX value. It keeps track of the maximum sum found and the corresponding subarray indices.

However, the way it calculates the new sum is incorrect. The formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` does not correctly represent the new sum after replacing the subarray with its MEX. The new sum should be calculated by adding the MEX value multiplied by the length of the subarray, not the square of the length.

### Function 2: `func_2`
This function is recursive and seems to be intended to generate a sequence of operations to replace a subarray `[r:l]` with its MEX value. However, the logic is not clear and does not seem to correctly generate the required operations.

### Function 3: `func_3`
This function is supposed to perform the replacement of the subarray `[r:l]` with its MEX value, update the list, and generate the corresponding operations. However, the logic here is also flawed. It appends operations without ensuring that the MEX value is correctly calculated or applied.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the new sum, generating operations, and replacing subarrays with their MEX values is incorrect. Therefore, the program is not correct.
