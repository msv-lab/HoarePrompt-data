The variable `s` is assigned the value of the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided. The value of `n` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, and `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
