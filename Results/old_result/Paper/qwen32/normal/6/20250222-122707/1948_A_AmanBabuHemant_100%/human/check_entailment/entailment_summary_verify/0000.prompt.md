You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times and prints 'YES' followed by the string `s` if the length of `s` is less than 200. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it incorrectly states that there is no suitable string for odd values of `n`. However, there are suitable strings for odd values of `n` as well. For example, if `n` is 1, a suitable string could be "A", where the character 'A' is special because it has no neighbors. Another example is if `n` is 3, a suitable string could be "ABA", where 'A' at positions 1 and 3 are special.

Here is a counterexample for the program:
- Input: `1`
- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  A
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

The program should be able to handle odd values of `n` correctly by constructing a string where the special characters meet the criteria. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
