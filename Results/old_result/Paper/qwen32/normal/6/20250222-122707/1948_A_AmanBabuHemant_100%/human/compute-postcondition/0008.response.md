The initial state describes that `t` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is an even integer input, and `s` is a string formed by repeating the substring `'AAB'` a total of `n // 2` times. The length of `s` is guaranteed to be less than 200.

The provided code snippet contains a single `print` statement:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:

Output: **YES**
