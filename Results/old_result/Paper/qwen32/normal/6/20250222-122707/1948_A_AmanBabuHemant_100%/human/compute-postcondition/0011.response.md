Let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine the output.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50.
2. `n` is an integer value provided by the input and `n` is even.
3. `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.
4. The length of `s` is 200 or more.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward. It prints the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` do not influence the output of this print statement because it explicitly specifies the string to be printed.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
