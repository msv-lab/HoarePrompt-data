Let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Variable `t`**: It is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 50\). However, `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the output of the `print` statement.

2. **Variable `n`**: It is a newly input integer. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but it will be used to determine the value of `s`.

3. **Variable `s`**: It is defined as the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. The `//` operator denotes integer division, which means it will divide `n` by 2 and take the floor of the result (i.e., the largest integer less than or equal to the division result).

Given this information, the string `s` will be constructed by repeating the substring `'AAB'` a certain number of times, determined by `n // 2`.

Let's consider the `print` statement:
```python
print(s)
```

The output will be the string `s`, which is `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine the exact string that will be printed. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **'AAB' repeated (n // 2) times (where n is the newly input integer)**
