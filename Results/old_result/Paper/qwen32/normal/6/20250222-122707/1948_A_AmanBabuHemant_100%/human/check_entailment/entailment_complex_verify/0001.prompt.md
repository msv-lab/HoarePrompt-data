You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that all iterations are completed. The value of `n` will be the integer from the last iteration's input. If `n` from the last iteration is odd, no string `s` is generated. If `n` from the last iteration is even, `s` will be the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times, provided its length is less than 200. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, no string `s` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` by repeating the substring 'AAB' `n // 2` times and prints 'YES' followed by the string `s` if the length of `s` is less than 200. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

The problem asks us to create a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters in this string. A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example:
- In the string "AAABAACC", the special characters are at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. This means 'A' at position 1 is special because it's equal to its right neighbor 'A', 'A' at position 3 is special because it's equal to its right neighbor 'A' but different from its left neighbor 'B', and so on.

### Key Observations

1. **Special Characters in Patterns:**
   - To create a special character, we need a pattern where a character is equal to one of its neighbors but not both. For example, in the pattern "AAB", the middle 'A' is special because it's equal to the 'A' on its left but different from the 'B' on its right.

2. **Counting Special Characters:**
   - In the pattern "AAB", there are 2 special characters: the middle 'A' and the 'B'.
   - Therefore, in the pattern "AAB" repeated `k` times, there will be `2k` special characters.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - To have exactly `n` special characters, `n` must be even because each "AAB" pattern contributes 2 special characters.
   - If `n` is odd, it's impossible to form a string with exactly `n` special characters using the pattern "AAB".

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
```

1. **Handling Odd `n`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n` is odd (`n % 2 != 0`), it's impossible to create a string with exactly `n` special characters, so it prints "NO".

2. **Handling Even `n`:**
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
   - It then checks if the length of this string is less than 200, which is always true for `n <= 50` because the maximum length of the string is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, well below 200.
   - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles both cases:
- It correctly identifies when it's impossible to form a string with exactly `n` special characters (when `n` is odd).
- It correctly constructs and prints a valid string when `n` is even.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
