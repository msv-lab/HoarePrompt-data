Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
2. `n` is the integer value provided by the input.
3. `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `t` is mentioned but not used in the provided code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
- The variable `n` is used to determine how many times the string `'AAB'` is repeated.
- The variable `s` is constructed by repeating the string `'AAB'` `n // 2` times. The `//` operator performs integer division, which means it divides `n` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

### Output Determination:
- If `n` is an even number, `n // 2` will be an integer, and the string `'AAB'` will be repeated exactly `n // 2` times.
- If `n` is an odd number, `n // 2` will still be an integer, and the string `'AAB'` will be repeated `n // 2` times. The remaining character (which would be one 'A' if `n` is odd) is not included in `s`.

### Example Outputs:
- If `n = 4`, then `n // 2 = 2`, and `s` will be `'AABAAB'`.
- If `n = 5`, then `n // 2 = 2`, and `s` will be `'AABAAB'`.
- If `n = 6`, then `n // 2 = 3`, and `s` will be `'AABAABAAB'`.

### General Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.

### Final Output:
Output: **'AAB' repeated n // 2 times (where n is the integer value provided by the input)**
