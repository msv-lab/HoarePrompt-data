Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is the integer value provided by the input, and `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. The condition `len(s) < 200` does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s` since both the if and else parts leave them unchanged.**
