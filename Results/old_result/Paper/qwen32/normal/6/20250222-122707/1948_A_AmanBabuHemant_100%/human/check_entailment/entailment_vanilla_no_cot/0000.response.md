Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly `n` special characters.
2. **Special Character Definition**: A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= t <= 50` (number of test cases)
   - `1 <= n <= 50` (number of special characters required in the string)
4. **Output Requirements**:
   - If no such string exists, print "NO".
   - Otherwise, print "YES" followed by a string of length at most 200 that meets the criteria.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reading the required number of special characters `n`.
3. Checking if `n` is odd:
   - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in the described pattern.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times.
4. It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200:
   - If true, it prints "YES" followed by the string `s`.
   - If false, it prints "NO".

### Verification:
1. **Odd `n` Case**:
   - The program correctly identifies that an odd number of special characters cannot be achieved with the given pattern (since each "AAB" contributes exactly 2 special characters).
   - Thus, printing "NO" for odd `n` is correct.

2. **Even `n` Case**:
   - The pattern "AAB" contributes exactly 2 special characters.
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string of length `3 * (n // 2)`.
   - Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of the string is `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well within the 200-character limit.
   - Therefore, the program correctly prints "YES" followed by the constructed string for even `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all valid inputs as per the problem description and constraints. Thus, it is correct.

**Your response:**
Correctness: **True**
