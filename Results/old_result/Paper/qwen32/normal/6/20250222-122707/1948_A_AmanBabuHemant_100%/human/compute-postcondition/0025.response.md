The given task provides an initial state with two variables, `t` and `n`. However, the print statement in the code snippet does not use these variables. The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO'.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `t` or `n`, the output will always be 'NO' regardless of the values of `t` and `n`.

Output: **NO**
