Reasoning:  
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` indicating the number of special characters required in the output string. The program checks if `n` is odd or even. If `n` is odd, it is impossible to construct such a string where exactly `n` characters are special and each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, so the program correctly outputs "NO". If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that there are exactly two special characters per repetition ("AAB" has special characters at positions 1 and 2). Since `n` is even, `n // 2` repetitions will result in exactly `n` special characters, and the length of the resulting string will be `3 * (n // 2)`. Given the constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 50`), the maximum length of the string will be `3 * (50 // 2) = 75`, which is well below the 200-character limit. Therefore, the program will always output "YES" followed by a valid string when `n` is even.

Correctness: **True**
