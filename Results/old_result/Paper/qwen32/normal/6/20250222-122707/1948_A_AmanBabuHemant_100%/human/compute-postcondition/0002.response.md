The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the input. The initial value of `n` is no longer relevant as it is overwritten. The value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is the integer value provided by the input.**
