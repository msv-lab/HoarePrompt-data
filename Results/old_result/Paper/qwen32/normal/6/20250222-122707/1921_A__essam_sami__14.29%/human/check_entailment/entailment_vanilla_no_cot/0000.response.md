Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The program computes the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to calculate the distance between any two adjacent points (which will be the side length of the square) and then square that distance to get the area.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate the squared distances between all pairs of points
        distances = []
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i + 1, 4):
                dist = (points[i][0] - points[j][0]) ** 2 + (points[i][1] - points[j][1]) ** 2
                distances.append(dist)
        
        # The area of the square is the square of the side length
        # The side length is the smaller of the two unique distances
        side_length_squared = min(distances)
        print(side_length_squared)

func()
```

This corrected version calculates the squared distances between all pairs of points, identifies the smaller squared distance (which corresponds to the side length of the square), and then prints it as the area of the square.
