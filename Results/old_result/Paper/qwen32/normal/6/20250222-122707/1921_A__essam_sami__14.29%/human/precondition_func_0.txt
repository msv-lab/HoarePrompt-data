The input consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case is described by four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) which are the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive (strictly greater than 0) area.
