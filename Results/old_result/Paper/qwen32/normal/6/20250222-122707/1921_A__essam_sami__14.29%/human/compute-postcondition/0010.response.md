Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers read from the input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`; and `x` is less than or equal to `n`.**
