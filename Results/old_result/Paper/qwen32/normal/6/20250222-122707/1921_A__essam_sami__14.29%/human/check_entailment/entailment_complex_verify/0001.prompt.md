You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case is described by four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) which are the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive (strictly greater than 0) area.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the coordinates of the corners of two squares were read: (a, b), (c, d) for the first square, and (e, f), (g, h) for the second square. The distances squared from the center of the first square to the center of the second square were calculated as `n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)` and `x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. For each test case, the smaller of the two distances squared (`n` or `x`) was printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of the coordinates of the corners of two squares with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For each test case, it calculates the squared distance from the center of one square to the center of the other square and prints the smaller of the two squared distances.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
- The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
- The area of a square can be calculated as the square of the length of any of its sides.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of the square.

2. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points: `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, and `(c, d)` and `(g, h)`.
   - These squared distances are stored in variables `n` and `x` respectively.

3. **Area Calculation:**
   - The program prints the smaller of the two squared distances, assuming that the smaller distance corresponds to the side length of the square.
   - The area of the square is then the smaller squared distance.

### Flaw in the Program:
- The program assumes that the smaller of the two squared distances will always be the side length of the square. However, this is not necessarily true.
- There are four pairs of points among the four corners of the square, and the program only checks two of them. It does not consider all possible pairs of points.
- To correctly determine the side length of the square, the program should compare all possible pairs of points and select the smallest non-zero squared distance.

### Correctness:
Given the flaw in the program, it may not always produce the correct area for the square, especially if the smallest squared distance calculated is not the side length of the square.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the side length of the square in all cases and thus may not always output the correct area.
