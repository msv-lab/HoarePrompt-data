The code calculates the value of `x` based on the formula `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, and `n` remain unchanged. The new value of `x` is derived from the given formula.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `c` and `d` are integers read from the input; `e` and `f` are integers read from the input; `g` and `h` are integers read from the input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`**.
