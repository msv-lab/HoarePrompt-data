To determine the output of the `print(n)` statement, we need to follow the sequence of operations described in the initial state:

1. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
   - `e` and `f` are integers read from the input.
   - `g` and `h` are integers read from the input.
   - `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.

2. **Subsequent Operations**:
   - `x` is recalculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`.
   - `c` and `d` are new integers read from the input.
   - A comparison is made between the new `x` and `n` to determine if `x` is greater than `n` or not.
   - `steps` is set to 4.

The `print(n)` statement will output the value of `n` which is calculated as:
\[ n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f) \]

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n`. However, based on the given information, the `print(n)` statement will output the calculated value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is calculated as (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f))**
