Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input; `c` and `d` are integers read from the input; `e` and `f` are integers read from the input; `g` and `h` are integers read from the input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `n` is now the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`. All other variables retain their initial values.
