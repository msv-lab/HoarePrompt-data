You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

The problem requires us to move chips to form a single contiguous block with the minimum number of operations. The operations consist of moving a chip to the closest free cell to its left. The key observation is that the minimum number of operations needed is equal to the number of free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the provided program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells (0 for free, 1 for chip).

2. **Trimming Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program removes leading free cells (zeros) by using `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`. This step ensures that the leftmost chip is at the start of the list.
   - Then, it removes trailing free cells (zeros) using `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`. This ensures that the rightmost chip is at the end of the list.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - After trimming, the list `a` contains only the relevant section with chips at the ends and potentially free cells in between.
   - The program then counts the number of free cells (zeros) in this trimmed list using `for i in range(len(a)): if a[i] == 0: res += 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of free cells, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single contiguous block.

**Correctness Analysis:**

The logic of the program is sound. By trimming the list to only include the section between the leftmost and rightmost chips, and then counting the free cells within that section, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required.

**Example Verification:**

Let's verify the program with the first test case from the problem statement:

- Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
- After trimming leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
- Count of zeros (free cells): `1`
- Output: `1`

This matches the expected output, indicating the program works correctly for this case. The same logic applies to other test cases as well.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
