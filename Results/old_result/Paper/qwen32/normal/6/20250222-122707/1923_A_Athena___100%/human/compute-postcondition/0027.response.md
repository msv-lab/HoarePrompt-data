The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the length of `a` after removing all trailing zeros where 1 <= `n` <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, the first element is not 0 if `a` is not empty; `res` is 1; `i` is 0.
