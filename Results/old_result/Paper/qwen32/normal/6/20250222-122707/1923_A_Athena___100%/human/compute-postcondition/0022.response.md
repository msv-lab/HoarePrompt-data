Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `n` is the length of `a` after removing all trailing zeros where 1 <= `n` <= 50; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, the first element is not 0 if `a` is not empty; if the current element `a[i]` is 0, `res` is 1; otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
