The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the list `a`. Since `a` is not being modified in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is pointing to the current element being processed in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, provided that `i` is still less than the length of the list `a`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `t` and `n` do not affect the loop's continuation, so they remain unchanged. The variable `res` is also not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, if `i` was pointing to the `k`-th element at the end of the previous iteration, it should point to the `(k+1)`-th element at the start of the next iteration, provided `k+1` is less than the length of `a`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list with at least one element; `i` is `i + 1`**
