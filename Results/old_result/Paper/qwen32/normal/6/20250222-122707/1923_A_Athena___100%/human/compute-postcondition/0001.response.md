In the provided task, the for loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, meaning it is not used within the loop body. The only variable in the loop head that we can adjust is `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, the state does not need to be adjusted for `t` itself because it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute (i.e., `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient for the loop to execute. No further adjustments are needed for the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. In each test case, there is at least one a_i that equals 1.**
