Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. The program simply counts the number of free cells within the range of the first and last chip, but it does not account for the optimal way to move the chips to minimize the number of operations.

For example, consider the test case `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`. The program will count 3 free cells between the first and last chip, but it does not consider the optimal moves. The correct minimum number of operations for this test case is 3, which can be achieved by moving the chips in a specific order to minimize the total number of moves. The provided program does not handle this correctly and would output 3, which is correct in this case, but it does not handle all cases correctly. For instance, if the input is `0 0 1 0 1 0 0`, the program would output 3, but the correct answer is 2.

A correct solution would involve calculating the cost of moving each chip to the leftmost possible position while maintaining the order of chips.
