To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`tc`**: Defined as `x + 2`.
2. **`N`**: An integer greater than `x + 2`.
3. **`a`**: A list of integers.
4. **`cnt`**: A `defaultdict` where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`.
5. **`i`**: Initially set to `N`.
6. **`t`**: Incremented by 1 if `cnt[i]` is 1.

### Print Statement:
The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The value of `i` is explicitly set to `N` in the initial state.
- The value of `N` is described as an integer greater than `x + 2`.
- The print statement directly outputs the value of `i`, which is `N`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `i` is explicitly set to `N` and `N` is an integer greater than `x + 2`, the print statement will output the value of `N`.

### Output:
Output: **N (where N is an integer greater than x + 2)**
