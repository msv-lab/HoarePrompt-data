Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0; `N` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of each `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from `t` to `N-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is either 0 or 1, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of each `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from `t` to `N-1`. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `t` is 0 and `cnt[i]` is not 0, the program does not break and continues. If `t` is 1, the program does not break and continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is either 0 or 1, `N` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0, and the count of each `a[i]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1 for all `i` from `t` to `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` equals 1, `t` is updated to 2. `i` is `i + 1`. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is either 0 or 1 (specifically, `t` is 1 if it was initially 0, and `t` is 0 if it was initially 1) if `cnt[i]` is equal to 1. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged; `N` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0; `i` is `i + 1`. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
