The code snippet reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `tc` remains unchanged as it is defined by the initial condition `tc` is `x + 1`, where `x + 1 < int(input())`. The initial condition for `tc` does not depend on the new input for `N`.

Output State: **`tc` is `x + 1`, where `x + 1 < int(input())`; `N` is an input integer.**
