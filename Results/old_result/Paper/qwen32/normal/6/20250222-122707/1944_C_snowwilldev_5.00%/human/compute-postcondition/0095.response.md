Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`tc`** is defined as `x + 2`.
2. **`N`** is an integer greater than `x + 2`.
3. **`a`** is a list of integers.
4. **`cnt`** is a `defaultdict` where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`.
5. **`i`** is defined as `N - 1`.
6. If `cnt[i]` is equal to 1, `t` is increased by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is defined as `N - 1`.
- Since `N` is an integer greater than `x + 2`, `i` will be `N - 1`, which is also an integer greater than `x + 1`.

### Output:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is `N - 1`.

Since the exact value of `N` and `x` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `i`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is `N - 1`.

Output: **N - 1 (where N is an integer greater than x + 2)**
