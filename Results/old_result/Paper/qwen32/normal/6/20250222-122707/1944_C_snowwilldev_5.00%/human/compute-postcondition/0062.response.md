Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `tc` is defined as `x + 1`.
2. `N` is greater than `x + 3`.
3. `a` is a list of integers from the input.
4. `cnt` is a `defaultdict` where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`.
5. `i` is defined as `x + 3`.
6. Based on the value of `cnt[i]`:
   - If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1.
   - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
   - Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly defined as `x + 3`.
- The `print` statement is `print(i)`, which means it will print the value of `i`.

### Determining the Output:
- Since `i` is explicitly defined as `x + 3`, the value of `i` will be `x + 3` when the `print` statement is executed.
- The other variables and conditions in the state description do not affect the value of `i` directly, as the print statement only references `i`.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is `x + 3`.

Output: **x + 3**
