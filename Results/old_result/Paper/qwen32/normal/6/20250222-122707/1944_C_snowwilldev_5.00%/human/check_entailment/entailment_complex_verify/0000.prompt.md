You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a list of n integers a where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: `tc` is equal to the total number of test cases `t`, `N` is the length of the list for the last test case, `a` is the list of integers for the last test case, `cnt` is a defaultdict with counts of elements in `a` for the last test case, `t` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is either the index where the loop broke or `N-1` if the loop did not break early.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, where each element `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. It then determines and prints the smallest index `i` such that either the count of `i` in the list `a` is 1 or the count of `i` is 0, or if there are at least two unique elements with a count of 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX score based on the moves of Alice and Bob. Let's analyze why this is the case:

The program attempts to find the smallest non-negative integer that appears either only once in the array or not at all. However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not consider their strategies to maximize or minimize the MEX score, respectively.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX score, so she should aim to add higher numbers to `c` if possible.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX score, so he should aim to prevent Alice from adding higher numbers to `c`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the smallest number that appears only once or not at all in `a` will be the MEX of `c` after all moves are completed.
   - This is not necessarily true because the order in which numbers are chosen by Alice and Bob affects the final composition of `c`.

### Example Where the Program Fails:
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```
- **Optimal Moves**:
  - Alice can choose `3` first, then `2`, then `2` again, and finally `1`.
  - Bob can choose `0` in his turns.
- **Final `c`**:
  - `c = [3, 2, 2, 1]` or any permutation of these elements.
- **MEX of `c`**:
  - The MEX of `[3, 2, 2, 1]` is `0` because `0` is not in `c`.

However, the program will output `1` for this test case because `1` is the smallest number that appears only once in `a`.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach would involve simulating the game with optimal moves for both players and then calculating the MEX of the final array `c`. This might involve more complex logic, such as using a priority queue or a strategy to track the availability of numbers for Alice and Bob to choose from optimally.

Since the provided program does not handle these aspects correctly, it is incorrect.
