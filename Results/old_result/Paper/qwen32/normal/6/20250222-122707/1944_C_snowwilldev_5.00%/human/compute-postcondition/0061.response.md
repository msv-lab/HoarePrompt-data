Postcondition: **`tc` is `x + 1`, `N` is greater than `x + 3`, `a` is the list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`. `i` is `x + 3`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1. If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.**
