### Reasoning:
The program provided is intended to determine the final score of the game based on the optimal play by Alice and Bob. The score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after all elements from array `a` have been distributed between `c` and the discarded elements according to the rules of the game.

The strategy in the game is as follows:
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, which means she wants to include as many unique small integers as possible in `c`.
- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, which means he wants to prevent Alice from including small integers in `c`.

The core logic of the program is to count the occurrences of each integer in `a` and then determine the smallest integer `i` such that either:
1. `i` appears exactly once in `a`, or
2. `i` does not appear in `a` at all, or
3. There are at least two unique integers that appear exactly once.

This logic correctly identifies the smallest `i` that can be the MEX of `c` under optimal play by both players:
- If `i` appears exactly once, Alice can include it in `c`, and Bob cannot prevent this because he cannot remove the only occurrence of `i`.
- If `i` does not appear in `a`, then it is trivially the MEX of `c`.
- If there are at least two unique integers that appear exactly once, Alice can ensure that `c` includes at least two unique small integers, which means the MEX will be at least 2.

Thus, the program correctly determines the MEX of `c` based on the described optimal strategy for both players.
