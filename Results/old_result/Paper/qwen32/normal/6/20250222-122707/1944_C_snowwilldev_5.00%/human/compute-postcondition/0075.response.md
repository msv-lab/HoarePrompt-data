The code snippet `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element at index `i` in list `a` by 1 in the defaultdict `cnt`. Given that `i` is `N-1`, the element at index `N-1` in list `a` is `a[N-1]`. Therefore, the count of `a[N-1]` in `cnt` is incremented by 1.

Since `cnt[a[N-1]]` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, this operation will increment it by an additional 1, making the total increment for `a[N-1]` equal to 2.

The other variables (`tc`, `N`, `a`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tc` is `x + 2`, `N` is the new input integer that must be greater than `x + 3`, `a` is the new list of integers from the input, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a` with the count of `a[N-1]` incremented by 2 and the count of `a[N]` incremented by 1, `t` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is `N-1`**.
