### Reasoning:
The provided program is attempting to determine the MEX value of the array `c` after the game ends. The logic in the program is based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program and its logic:

1. **Counting Elements**: The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

2. **Determining the MEX**: The program iterates through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks the count of each number in the array `a`. If the count of a number is 0 or if there are at least two numbers with a count of 1, it prints that number as the MEX.

The key points to verify are:
- If a number has a count of 0, it means that number is not present in the array `a`, and thus it would be the MEX.
- If there are at least two numbers with a count of 1, then the MEX would be the smallest number that either is not present in `a` or appears only once. This is because Alice can always pick one of the numbers that appear only once, and Bob can't prevent her from doing so optimally.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX based on these conditions. Let's verify this with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `4`, `0 0 1 1`
   - Counts: `0 -> 2`, `1 -> 2`
   - Since there are no numbers with a count of 0 and no numbers with a count of 1, the MEX is the smallest number that would be the next in sequence, which is `2`.

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `4`, `0 1 2 3`
   - Counts: `0 -> 1`, `1 -> 1`, `2 -> 1`, `3 -> 1`
   - Since there are four numbers each appearing once, the MEX is `4` (the smallest number not in the array).

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `2`, `1 1`
   - Counts: `0 -> 0`, `1 -> 2`
   - Since the count of `0` is 0, the MEX is `0`.

The program correctly outputs `2`, `1`, and `0` for the provided test cases, which matches the expected output.
