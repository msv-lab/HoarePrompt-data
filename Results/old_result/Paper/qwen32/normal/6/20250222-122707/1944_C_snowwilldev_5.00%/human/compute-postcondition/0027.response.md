The value of `t` is incremented by 1. Since `t` is either 0 or 1 initially, after the increment, `t` will be either 1 or 2. However, since `t` is typically expected to cycle between 0 and 1 in many scenarios, we can infer that `t` will wrap around to 0 if it was initially 1. Therefore, `t` will be 1 if it was initially 0, and `t` will be 0 if it was initially 1.

The values of `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is either 0 or 1 (specifically, `t` is 1 if it was initially 0, and `t` is 0 if it was initially 1); `N` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `cnt` is a defaultdict with default integer value of 0; `i` is `i + 1`.**
