### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies several critical flaws in the provided program. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered:**
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, which are essential for determining the optimal MEX score.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX score by strategically choosing higher numbers, while Bob aims to minimize it by preventing Alice from adding higher numbers.

2. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the smallest number that appears only once or not at all in `a` will be the MEX of `c` after all moves are completed.
   - This assumption is flawed because the order in which numbers are chosen by Alice and Bob affects the final composition of `c`.

3. **Example Where the Program Fails:**
   - For the test case `1 5 0 1 2 2 3`, the program incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `0`.
   - The optimal moves for Alice and Bob would result in a final `c` that has a MEX of `0`.

Given these points, the program does not correctly determine the optimal MEX score based on the strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the program's incorrectness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
