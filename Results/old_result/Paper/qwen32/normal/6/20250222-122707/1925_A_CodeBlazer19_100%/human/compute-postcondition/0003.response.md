Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, but `t` is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. `i` is 0, but `i` is also not directly used in the provided code snippet.
3. `n` is the first integer from the input.
4. `k` is the second integer from the input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
```

### Explanation:
1. `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]`:
   - This slices the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` from the start up to, but not including, the `k`-th character.
   - For example, if `k` is 3, the result of `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` would be `'abc'`.

2. `* n`:
   - This multiplies the resulting substring by `n`, meaning it repeats the substring `n` times.
   - For example, if the substring is `'abc'` and `n` is 2, the result would be `'abcabc'`.

### Output Description:
- The output will be a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times.
- For example, if `k` is 3 and `n` is 2, the output would be `'abcabc'`.

### Final Output:
Output: **the first `k` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times (where `k` is the second integer from the input and `n` is the first integer from the input)**
