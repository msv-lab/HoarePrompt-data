The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state specifies that `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. The values of `n` and `k` are not specified initially but are overwritten by the input values.

After the execution of the code, the values of `n` and `k` will be the integers provided in the input, and the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input.**
