The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these two variables. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `t` does not need to be changed as long as it remains greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `k` is the second integer from the new input**
