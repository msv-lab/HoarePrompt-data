Let's break down the given task and determine the output of the print statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 2 (though `t` is not used in the provided code snippet, it's part of the initial state).
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the new input.
- `k` is the second integer from the new input.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
```

### Analysis:
- `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]` slices the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` from the beginning up to, but not including, the `k`-th character. This means if `k` is 5, the slice will be `'abcde'`.
- The result of the slice is then multiplied by `n`, which means the sliced string will be repeated `n` times.

### Output:
The output will be a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times.

### Example:
If `k` is 5 and `n` is 3, the output will be `'abcdeabcdeabcde'`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n (where 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] is the first k characters of the alphabet repeated n times)**
