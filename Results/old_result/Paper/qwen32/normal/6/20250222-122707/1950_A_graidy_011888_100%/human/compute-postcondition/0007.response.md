The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'PEAK'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n`, but these variables are not used in the provided print statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string inside the `print` function.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
2. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with the conditions `a < b` and `b > c`.
3. The variable `n` is greater than 0.
4. The `print` statement is `print('PEAK')`, which directly outputs the string `'PEAK'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `n`, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **PEAK**
