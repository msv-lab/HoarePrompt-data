Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input; `n` is greater than 0. If `a < b < c`, then the relationship `a < b < c` holds true. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a < b` and `b > c`, then `a < b` and `b > c` holds true. Otherwise, neither `a < b < c` nor `a < b and b > c` holds true; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value and must be less than `n`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a < b < c` is true or false, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` remain consistent with the precondition. The only change is that `i` is incremented by 1 and must still be less than `n`.
