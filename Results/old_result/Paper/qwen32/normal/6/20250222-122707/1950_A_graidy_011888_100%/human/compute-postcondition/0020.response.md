The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

In natural language: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now the integers provided by the input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, with `i` having been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
