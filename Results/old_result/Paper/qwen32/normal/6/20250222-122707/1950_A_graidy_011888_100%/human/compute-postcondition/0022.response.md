The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'PEAK'. The initial state provides information about several variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables.
2. The string 'PEAK' is directly provided to the `print` function.

Thus, the output will be the string 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
