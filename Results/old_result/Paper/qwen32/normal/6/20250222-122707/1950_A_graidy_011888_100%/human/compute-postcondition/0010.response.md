Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input; `n` is greater than 0. If `a < b` and `b > c`, then `a < b` and `b > c` holds true. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c` and it is also not the case that `a < b and b > c`.**
