Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers provided by the input in the last iteration; `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed; `i` is equal to `n` after the loop has finished executing.**

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 1000. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` hold the values provided by the input in the last iteration of the loop. The variable `n` is at least as large as the number of iterations that were executed, and `i` has been incremented to be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
