Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the first line of the input.
2. For each test case, the program reads three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the digits.
3. The program then checks the conditions for a "STAIR" and a "PEAK" as follows:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b` and `b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
4. If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE".
5. The conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" are correctly implemented according to the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
