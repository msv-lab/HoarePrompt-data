Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the new `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`. The current value of `hd` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop, but since no changes are made to the variables in this specific code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
