Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` was initially greater than 0, then `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 2`; otherwise, `hd` is `-1`. `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 2` if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` becomes `abs(a1 - a2) + 2`; otherwise, `res` becomes `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
