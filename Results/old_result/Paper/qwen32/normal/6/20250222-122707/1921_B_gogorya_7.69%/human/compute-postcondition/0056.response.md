Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `hd` was greater than 0 and `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, then `hd` is decremented by 1 to become `a1 - a2 - 1`, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. `res` is either `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` or `abs(a1 - a2)` based on the condition in the loop body, and `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`. `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
