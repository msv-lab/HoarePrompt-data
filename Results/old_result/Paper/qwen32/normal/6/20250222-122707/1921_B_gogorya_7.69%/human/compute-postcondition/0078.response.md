The code snippet `hd -= 1` decrements the value of `hd` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is `hd - 1`, and `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` if `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`. Otherwise, `res` remains `abs(a1 - a2)`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
