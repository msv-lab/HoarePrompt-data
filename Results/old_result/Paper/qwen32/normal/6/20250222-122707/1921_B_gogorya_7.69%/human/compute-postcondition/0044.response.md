Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. At the current index `i`, `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. If `hd` (which is `a1 - a2`) is greater than 0, then `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1`. Otherwise, `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)` in both cases.**
