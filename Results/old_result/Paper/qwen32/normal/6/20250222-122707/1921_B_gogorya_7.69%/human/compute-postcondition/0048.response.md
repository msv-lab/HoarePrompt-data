The code snippet provided is `hd -= 1`, which decrements the value of `hd` by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `hd - 1`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` (or `abs(a1 - a2)` based on the condition in the loop body); `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

In natural language, the output state is: `t` remains an input integer between 1 and 10^4; `n` remains an input integer greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` remain the same input strings; `a1` remains the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` remains the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is now one less than its previous value; `res` remains the same unless it was dependent on `hd` in a conditional statement, and `i` is incremented by 1.
