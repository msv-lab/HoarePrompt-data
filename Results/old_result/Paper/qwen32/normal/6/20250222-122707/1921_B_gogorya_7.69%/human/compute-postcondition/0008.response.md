The code calculates the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2` and assigns this value to `res`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged. The value of `res` is the absolute value of `hd` (which is `a1 - a2`).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`**.
