Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `s1` is the string input; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`.**

Explanation: The variable `hd` is calculated as the difference between `a1` and `a2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
