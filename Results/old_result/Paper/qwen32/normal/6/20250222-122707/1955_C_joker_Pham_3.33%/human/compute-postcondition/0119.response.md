The code snippet `a[l] -= a[r]` modifies the value of `a[l]` by subtracting the value of `a[r]` from it. The values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `k`, `sunks`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `k` is unchanged, `sunks` is unchanged, `a[r]` is unchanged, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]`.**
