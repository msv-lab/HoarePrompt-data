Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now 0, each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 (except `a[l]` which is 0), the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `l` and `r` are integers, and `sunks` is `sunks + 1` if `k` was 0 initially, otherwise `sunks` is `sunks + 1`. Additionally, `a[r]` is less than the original value of `a[l]` (before the operation). The current value of `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`. The current value of `a[l]` is 0.**

In simpler terms: The value of `sunks` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values with the exception of `a[l]` which is now 0.
