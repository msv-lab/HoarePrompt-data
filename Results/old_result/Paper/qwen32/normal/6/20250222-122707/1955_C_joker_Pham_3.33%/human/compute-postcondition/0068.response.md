Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is `k - 2 * a[l]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is 0 if it was originally equal to 0, otherwise it retains its original value, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`; `l` retains its original value; if `a[r]` was 0, then `r` is decremented by 1 and `sunks` is incremented by 1, otherwise `r` retains its original value and `sunks` remains unchanged.**
