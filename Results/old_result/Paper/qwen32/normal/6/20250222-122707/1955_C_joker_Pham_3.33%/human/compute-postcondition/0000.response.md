Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language: The initial state of `n`, `k`, and `a` remains unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` are set to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively.
