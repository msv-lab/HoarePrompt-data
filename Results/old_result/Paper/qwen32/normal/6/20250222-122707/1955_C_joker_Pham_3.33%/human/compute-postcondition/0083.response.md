The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `sunks`, and `r`) retain their original values or have been previously modified as per the given initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is decreased by `a[r] * 2`; `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`; `a[r]`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values; `sunks` is incremented by 1; `l` is incremented by 1.**
