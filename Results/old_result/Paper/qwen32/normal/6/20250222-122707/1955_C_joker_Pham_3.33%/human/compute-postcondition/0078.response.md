Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5. `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without making any changes to the variables `n`, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks`.
