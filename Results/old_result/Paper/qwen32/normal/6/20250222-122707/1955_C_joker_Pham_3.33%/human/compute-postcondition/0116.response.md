Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. No changes are made to `sunks`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, or `l`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement without making any changes to the variables `sunks`, `r`, `k`, `a[r]`, or `l`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
