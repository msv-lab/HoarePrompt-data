Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is equal to `r`, and both are integers; `sunks` is 1; the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`.**

Natural Language: The value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
