The code snippet `sunks += 1` increments the value of the variable `sunks` by 1. The values of `n`, `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. The condition regarding `l`, `r`, and `k` in the initial state does not influence the execution of this specific line of code, as it does not depend on these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
