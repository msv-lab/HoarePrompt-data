The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given the initial state, no changes are made to any variables by the `continue` statement itself. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. The program simply proceeds to the next iteration of the loop without modifying these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is `k - 2 * a[l]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is 0 if it was originally equal to 0, otherwise it retains its original value, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`; `l` is `l + 1`; if `a[r]` was 0, then `r` is decremented by 1 and `sunks` is incremented by 1, otherwise `r` retains its original value and `sunks` remains unchanged; `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
