Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5. If `k` is 0, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values. Otherwise, `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` retain their original values as well. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0.**
