The code snippet `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. The values of `n`, `l`, `k`, `a[r]`, and `sunks` remain unchanged unless `r` was equal to `l` before the decrement, in which case the condition `l` is less than or equal to `r` might no longer hold. However, based on the given initial state, we only need to reflect the change in `r`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (before decrementing `r`), `k` and `a[r]` remain unchanged, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1.**
