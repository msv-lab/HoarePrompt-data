Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is unchanged, `sunks` is `sunks` + 1, `a[r]` is unchanged, `a[l]` is `a[l] - a[r]`.**

In natural language: The value of `l` is increased by 1, while the values of `n`, `r`, `k`, `sunks`, `a[r]`, and `a[l]` remain as they were, except for `l` which has been incremented.
