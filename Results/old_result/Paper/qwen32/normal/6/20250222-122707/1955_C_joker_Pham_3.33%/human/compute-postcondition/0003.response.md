Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer and its current value is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `sunks` is 0**
