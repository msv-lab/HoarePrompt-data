Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is `k - 2 * a[l]`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is 0 if it was originally equal to 0, otherwise it retains its original value, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`; `l` retains its original value; `r` retains its original value; `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `sunks` has increased by 1. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) retain their original values or previously described states.
