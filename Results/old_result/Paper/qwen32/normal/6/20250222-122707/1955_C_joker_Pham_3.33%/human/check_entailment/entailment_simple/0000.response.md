### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `l` and `r` are initialized to point to the first and last ships, respectively.
   - `sunks` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of ships that have sunk.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l <= r` and `k > 0`.
   - If `l == r` (only one ship left), the Kraken attacks it. If `k >= a[r]`, the ship sinks, and `sunks` is incremented.
   - If `a[l] <= a[r]`, the Kraken attacks the first ship first. If `k >= a[l] * 2`, both attacks (first and last) can be performed, reducing the durability of the first and last ships accordingly. If the last ship's durability drops to 0, `sunks` is incremented, and `r` is decremented. Similarly, if the first ship's durability drops to 0, `sunks` is incremented, and `l` is incremented.
   - If `a[r] < a[l]`, the logic is similar to the previous case but with the roles of the first and last ships swapped.
   - If `k < a[l] * 2` or `k < a[r] * 2`, the Kraken cannot perform both attacks, and the loop breaks.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is 0, the loop breaks immediately, and the function returns the current count of sunk ships.
   - If all ships have sunk (`l > r`), the loop breaks, and the function returns the count of sunk ships.

### Issues in the Provided Code:

1. **Handling of `k`**:
   - The code does not correctly handle the scenario where `k` is very large (up to \(10^{15}\)). The current approach iteratively reduces `k` by the number of attacks, which can be inefficient for large `k`.
   - A more efficient approach would be to determine how many complete cycles of attacks (attacking first and last) can be performed and then handle any remaining attacks separately.

2. **Logic for Single Ship**:
   - When `l == r`, the code correctly checks if `k >= a[r]` to determine if the ship sinks. However, it should also decrement `k` by `a[r]` and then break the loop since no more attacks can be performed on this ship.

3. **Logic for Remaining Attacks**:
   - After the loop, the code should check if any remaining attacks can sink additional ships. The current code does not handle this scenario correctly.

### Corrected Code:

To address these issues, we can modify the code to handle large `k` more efficiently and correctly:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
                k -= a[r]
            break
        
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            if k >= a[l] * 2:
                k -= a[l] * 2
                a[r] -= a[l]
                if a[r] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    r -= 1
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            elif k >= a[l]:
                k -= a[l]
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
            else:
                break
        
        elif a[r] < a[l]:
            if k >= a[r] * 2:
                k -= a[r] * 2
                a[l] -= a[r]
                if a[l] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    l += 1
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            elif k >= a[r]:
                k -= a[r]
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                break
    
    return sunks

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))
```

### Correctness:
