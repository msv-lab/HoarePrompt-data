Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. `sunks` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1. `k` is decreased by `a[l] * 2` and `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`.**

Explanation: The value of `sunks` is increased by 1. The value of `r` is decreased by 1. The values of `k` and `a[r]` are affected by the values of `a[l]` as specified, but since `a[l]` is not explicitly changed in the given code snippet, it remains the same. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
