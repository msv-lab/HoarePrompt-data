Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is greater than 0 and specifically `x` is `x - (2 ** i - 1)`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is max(`mx`, `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`), and `i` is `floor(log2(x + 1)) - 1`. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.**

In simpler terms, the value of `x` has been updated to `x - (2 ** i - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged with their respective conditions and values.
