The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The values of `t` and `X` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, and `x` is the integer value of the input provided minus 1.
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is the input value minus 1.**
