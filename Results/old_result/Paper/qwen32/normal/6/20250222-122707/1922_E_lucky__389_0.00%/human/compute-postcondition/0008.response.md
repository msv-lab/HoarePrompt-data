To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the `while` loop head: `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18
- `x` is the input value minus 1 and the input value must be at least 2
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list
- `mx` is 0
- `i` is 1

The loop condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` must be satisfied for the loop to execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, the condition becomes `2 ** (1 + 1) <= x + 1` or `4 <= x + 1`, which simplifies to `3 <= x`.

Since `x` is the input value minus 1 and the input value must be at least 2, `x` must be at least 1. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `x` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` must be at least 3, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 1**
