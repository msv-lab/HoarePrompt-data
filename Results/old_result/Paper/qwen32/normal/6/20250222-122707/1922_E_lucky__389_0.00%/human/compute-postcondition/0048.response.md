The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `subseq_lens`. No other variables are modified by this code. Therefore, the value of `t`, `X`, `mx`, and `i` remain the same. The only change is that `subseq_lens` now contains the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and the largest integer i such that 2^(i + 1) <= x + 1, and `i` is the largest integer such that 2^(i + 1) <= x + 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.**
