### Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to generate an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program reads an integer `X`, and then it calculates a sequence of significant bit positions that correspond to the binary representation of `X - 1`. These positions are used to determine the length and composition of the resulting array.

However, there are a few issues with the program that need to be addressed:

1. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The problem description specifies that there can be up to 1000 test cases, but the program is designed to handle only one test case at a time. The loop `for _ in range(t):` should call `func_1()` for each test case, but `func_1()` itself does not accept any arguments and does not handle the multiple test cases correctly.

2. **Construction of the Array**: The program constructs the array by appending indices and values from `subseq_lens`. However, the logic for constructing the array does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. The conversion from the binary representation to the array values is not correctly implemented to guarantee the exact number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the array and then the array itself, but the format might not always be correct due to the incorrect logic for generating the array.

### Correctness:

Given the issues mentioned above, particularly the incorrect handling of multiple test cases and the flawed logic for generating the array, the program is not correct as per the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
