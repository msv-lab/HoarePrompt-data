The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is already increased by 1, so after the execution of the code, `i` will be increased by an additional 1.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `x`, we cannot determine a specific new value for `x`. However, we know that the condition \(2\) (which seems to be incomplete in the initial state description) must still hold true.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 2, `x` must be such that \(2\) (condition is incomplete)**.
