Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

MOD = 1000000007

    t = int(input())

        func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
def func_1():

    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, X is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, x is 0, subseq_lens is a list of integers representing the significant bits of the original x + 1, mx is the maximum value of i encountered during the loop.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers with at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`, `ansv` is a list of integers starting from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: len(subseq_lens) - 1 (where len(subseq_lens) is the length of the subseq_lens list)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers with at least `mx + 1` elements, `mx` is the length of `ansv` minus 1, `ansv` is a list of integers starting from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[mx]`, `i` is `mx`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, processes it to determine a sequence of significant bit positions, and prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself. The input `X` must be an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. The function does not accept a parameter `t` for the number of test cases; instead, it processes a single input value `X`.
