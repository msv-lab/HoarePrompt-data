The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns a new value to `n` based on the input provided. The initial state of `n` is given as an input integer, but this value is overwritten by the new input. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is the new input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean that is True if there was at least one `i` with a frequency of 1, otherwise it remains False; `i` is equal to the new `n`.**
