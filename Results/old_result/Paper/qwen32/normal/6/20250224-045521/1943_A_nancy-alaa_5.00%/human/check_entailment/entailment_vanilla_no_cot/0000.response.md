Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the final score of the game based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. The program attempts to find the MEX of the array `c` that results from the game, but it does not simulate the game turns and does not account for the fact that Alice wants to maximize the MEX while Bob wants to minimize it.

Here's a breakdown of why the provided program is incorrect:

1. **Game Simulation**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array and tries to find the MEX without considering the strategic choices of the players.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice will try to add the smallest possible number to `c` that is not yet in it to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to prevent this by removing numbers that Alice might want to add.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic in the program is flawed. It checks for the first missing number in the range `[0, n)` but does not consider the turns and the strategic removals by Bob.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to simulate the game or use a more sophisticated approach to determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of both players. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        mex = 0
        
        # Simulate the game
        for i in range(n):
            if mpp[i] > 0:
                if mpp[i] % 2 == 1:
                    mex += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

This version of the program correctly calculates the MEX by considering the parity of the counts of each number in the array. If a number appears an odd number of times, it contributes to the MEX calculation because Alice can always add it to `c` while Bob cannot cancel it out completely.
