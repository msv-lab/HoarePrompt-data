To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand the behavior and the conditions under which the loop exits. Let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive). The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - **First Condition**: If `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Second Condition**: If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Third Condition**: If `mpp[i] == 1`, the variable `first` is set to True.

3. **Loop Termination**: The loop can terminate either due to one of the break conditions or when `i` reaches `n`.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we know that none of the break conditions were met in those iterations. Therefore, the loop continued to the next iteration until either a break condition was met or `i` reached `n`.

### Final Output State Analysis:
- **If the loop breaks due to the first condition**: The loop prints the value of `i` that is not a key in `mpp` and exits.
- **If the loop breaks due to the second condition**: The loop prints the value of `i` that has a frequency of 1 in `mpp` and `first` is True, then exits.
- **If the loop completes all iterations without breaking**: The loop runs until `i` reaches `n` without meeting any of the break conditions.

### Conclusion:
The final output state depends on whether the loop breaks during the iterations or completes all iterations without breaking. 

- **If the loop breaks during the iterations**: The output state will be the value of `i` that caused the break.
- **If the loop completes all iterations**: The output state will be the final value of `i`, which is `n`.

Since we do not have specific values for `n` and `arr`, we cannot definitively determine if the loop will break or not. However, we can describe the final state in both scenarios.

Given that the loop iterates `n` times and does not break prematurely based on the provided output states, the final state will be when `i` reaches `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is equal to `n`.**

In simpler terms, the final state is that the loop has completed all `n` iterations without breaking, and `i` is equal to `n`.
