Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `first` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
