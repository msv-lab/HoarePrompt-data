The loop head in the given example is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute a number of times based on the integer input provided. The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, so we don't need to adjust its state. The key variable here is the range, which is determined by the integer input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, the only variable that can be adjusted to determine if the loop will execute again is the input itself, which indirectly affects the range of the loop. However, since we cannot directly adjust the input, we consider the state just before the input is processed again.

Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop is not dependent on `i` or any other variables in the provided state, we need to consider the loop's dependence on the input. For the loop to execute one more time, the input must provide a positive integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration, considering only the objects in the loop head, is that the input must provide a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is equal to `n`; the next input must be a positive integer**
