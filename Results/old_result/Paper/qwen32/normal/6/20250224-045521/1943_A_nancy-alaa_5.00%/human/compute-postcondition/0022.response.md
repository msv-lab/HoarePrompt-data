Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is a boolean; `i` is `i + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**

Natural Language: The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial states.
