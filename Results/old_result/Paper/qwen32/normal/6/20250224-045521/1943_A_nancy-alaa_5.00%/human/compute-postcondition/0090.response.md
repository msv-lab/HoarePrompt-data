Given the initial state, let's analyze the variables and the print statement:

- `t` is an integer with a range from 0 to 20,000 - 1 (i.e., 0 to 19,999).
- `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.
- `arr` is a list of integers that is newly created from some input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that represents the frequency of each element in the current `arr`.
- `first` is a boolean value, but its exact value is not specified.
- `i` is a variable that is incremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value that will be printed. However, we know that `i` is incremented by 1 at some point before this print statement is executed. Therefore, the value of `i` will be whatever its initial value was plus 1.

Output: **i (where i is incremented by 1 from its initial value)**
