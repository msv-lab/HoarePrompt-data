To determine the output of the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `i` is being used.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\). This variable appears to be a loop counter or a test case counter, but it is not directly used in the provided print statement.
2. **`n`**: An input integer greater than 0. This variable represents the size or number of elements in the list `arr`.
3. **`arr`**: A list of integers obtained from the input. The exact values of the integers in the list are not specified.
4. **`mpp`**: A `Counter` object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`. This means `mpp` is a dictionary-like object where keys are the elements of `arr` and values are their respective counts.
5. **`first`**: A boolean variable. Its value is not specified, and it is not directly used in the provided print statement.
6. **`i`**: Initially, `i` is set to `i + 1`. This suggests that `i` is being incremented. However, the exact initial value of `i` before the increment is not provided. Additionally, there is a condition that if `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. This implies that `i` is being used as an index or key in `mpp`.

### Analysis of the Print Statement:
The print statement is `print(i)`. To determine what is printed, we need to know the value of `i` at the point where the print statement is executed. Given the context, `i` is being incremented (`i = i + 1`) and there is a condition that breaks out of a loop or if statement if `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`.

Since `i` is being incremented and the loop or if statement breaks if `i` is not a key in `mpp`, the value of `i` that gets printed will be the last valid key in `mpp` plus one. However, without knowing the exact keys in `mpp` or the initial value of `i`, we can only describe the printed value in terms of the given information.

### Conclusion:
The value of `i` that gets printed is the last key in the `mpp` Counter object plus one, or the point at which the loop or if statement breaks because `i` is no longer a key in `mpp`.

Output: **i (where i is the last valid key in the `mpp` Counter object plus one, or the point at which the loop or if statement breaks because `i` is no longer a key in `mpp`)**
