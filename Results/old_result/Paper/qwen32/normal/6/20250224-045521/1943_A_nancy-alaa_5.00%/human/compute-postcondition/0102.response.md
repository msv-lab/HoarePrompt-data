To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context in which `i` is used. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Variables and Objects in the Initial State:**
   - `t`: An integer with a value between 0 and 20,000 - 1.
   - `n`: An integer greater than 0.
   - `arr`: A list of integers.
   - `mpp`: A Counter object that represents the frequency of each element in the `arr` list.
   - `first`: A boolean value (though its exact value is not specified, it is not directly relevant to determining the value of `i`).
   - `i`: An integer that is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The loop breaks if `i` is not a key in `mpp`.

2. **Behavior of `i`:**
   - `i` is incremented in each iteration of a loop.
   - The loop breaks if `i` is not a key in `mpp`.
   - Therefore, the value of `i` printed will be the last valid key in `mpp` before the loop breaks.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - The value of `i` will be the highest integer key that exists in the `mpp` dictionary before the loop terminates.
   - Since `mpp` is a Counter object derived from `arr`, the keys of `mpp` are the unique elements of `arr`.
   - The exact value of `i` depends on the elements in `arr` and the order in which the loop increments `i`.

Given the information, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i` without knowing the contents of `arr`. However, we can describe the value of `i` in terms of the `mpp` dictionary.

Output: **i (where i is the last valid key in the mpp dictionary before the loop breaks)**
