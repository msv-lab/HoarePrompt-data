Output State: **t is 0; n is undefined; arr is undefined; mpp is undefined; first is undefined; i is undefined.**

### Explanation:
After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` (which represents the number of test cases) will be 0 because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` implicitly with each iteration (`for _ in range(int(input()))`). Once all iterations are complete, `t` will be 0.

The variables `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` are local to each iteration of the loop. Once the loop finishes, these variables are not retained outside the loop's scope. Therefore, after all iterations, they are undefined in the context of the overall program state.
