For the given task, we need to adjust the state based on the loop head, which is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. 

The loop head only involves the underscore `_` and the result of `int(input())`. Since the underscore `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the execution of the loop, we only need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a value that allows the loop to execute.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, we need to ensure that the input to the `int(input())` function is within this range for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is within the valid range for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4**
