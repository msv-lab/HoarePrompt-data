Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine the final score of the game, defined as the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been processed.
2. **Rules**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just removing them from `a` (Bob).
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.
3. **Key Insight**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - Since Alice and Bob play optimally, the game's score is determined by the smallest number that is not in the final array `c`.

### Solution Analysis:
The provided code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in the array `a`. It then iterates through numbers from `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest number that is not present in `a` or appears only once after the first occurrence of a number with a single count. This logic is flawed because:
1. **Incorrect Handling of MEX**:
   - The code does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It does not account for the fact that Alice will try to maximize the MEX by strategically choosing elements, while Bob will try to minimize it.
2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The condition `if mpp[i] == 1 and first` is incorrect and does not reflect the optimal strategy of the players.
   - The code does not consider the sequence of moves that Alice and Bob would make based on their objectives.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number.
2. **Determine MEX**:
   - Iterate through numbers starting from `0` and find the smallest number that is not present in `a` or has an even count (since Bob can always remove the second occurrence, leaving Alice with an odd count, which she can use to maximize the MEX).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
