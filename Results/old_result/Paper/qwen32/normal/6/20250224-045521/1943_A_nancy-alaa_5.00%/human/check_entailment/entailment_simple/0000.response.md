### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a`.
- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or simply deleting them (Bob).
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The goal is to find the MEX of `c` after both players play optimally.

#### Key Points:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should try to avoid filling in smaller numbers. Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should try to fill in smaller numbers.
3. **Turns**: Alice starts first and picks an element to add to `c`, while Bob picks an element to delete from `a`.

#### Code Analysis:
The provided code uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        first = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True
```

Let's break down the logic:
- **Loop through numbers from 0 to n-1**:
  - If a number `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is not present in `a`. This is the smallest number not in `a` and thus the MEX, so print `i` and break.
  - If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`, it means there is exactly one occurrence of `i` in `a` and this is the first such occurrence encountered. This implies that all smaller numbers are either not present or have multiple occurrences. Thus, `i` is the MEX, so print `i` and break.
  - If `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `False`, set `first` to `True`. This marks the first occurrence of a number with a single count.

#### Issues with the Code:
- The code does not correctly handle the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
- The code assumes that the first number with a single occurrence after the first number not in `a` is the MEX, which is not necessarily true.
- The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, which is crucial for determining the final MEX.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number.
2. **Simulate Turns**:
   - Alice should aim to avoid filling in smaller numbers.
   - Bob should aim to fill in smaller numbers.
3. **Determine MEX**:
   - After simulating the turns, determine the smallest number not present in `c`.

Given the issues with the provided code, it does not correctly simulate the game and determine the optimal MEX.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
