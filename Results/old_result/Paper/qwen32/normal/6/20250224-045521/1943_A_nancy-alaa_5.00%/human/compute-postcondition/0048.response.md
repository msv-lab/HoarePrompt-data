Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 - 1; `n` is an integer and must be greater than 0; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the new input; `mpp` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in `arr`; `first` is True; `i` is a key in `mpp` with a frequency of 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `mpp`, `first`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only impact of the `break` statement is that the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
