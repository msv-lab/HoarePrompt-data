Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. Specifically, if `x_i` is the amount bet on the `i`-th outcome and `k_i` is the multiplier for that outcome, we need to satisfy:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
for all `i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating `m`:**
   - `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k_i`. This is a valid step because `m` represents the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, scaled by their product.

3. **Calculating `c`:**
   - The list `c` is calculated such that each `c_i` is `m / k_i`. This means `c_i` represents the amount that, when multiplied by `k_i`, gives `m`.

4. **Finding the GCD of `c`:**
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in `c`. This step is aimed at simplifying the values in `c` to their smallest possible integers that still satisfy the problem's conditions.

5. **Simplifying `c`:**
   - Each element in `c` is divided by the GCD, ensuring that the values are as small as possible while maintaining the ratio.

6. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the simplified `c` values is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, it prints the values of `c`; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program's approach is fundamentally correct. By calculating `m` as the product of all `k_i`, and then distributing the bets as `m / k_i`, the program ensures that the total bet is `m`.
- Simplifying `c` by dividing by their GCD ensures that the values are minimized, which helps in checking if the condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) can be satisfied.
- The condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` is correct because it checks if the total bet (after simplification) is less than the smallest possible winning amount (also after simplification).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It calculates the bets in a way that ensures the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome, and it simplifies the bets to the smallest possible integers while maintaining the required condition.

Correctness: **True**
