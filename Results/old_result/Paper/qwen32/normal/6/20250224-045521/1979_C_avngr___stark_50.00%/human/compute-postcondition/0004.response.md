Output State: **`hcf` is the GCD of the previous `hcf` and `num`; `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements where the first element `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) represents the number of test cases, and the second element is the start of the test cases data; `num` is `numbers[2]`.**

In natural language: The variable `hcf` has been updated to be the greatest common divisor of its previous value and the value of `num`. The other variables, `numbers`, `t`, and `num`, remain unchanged.
