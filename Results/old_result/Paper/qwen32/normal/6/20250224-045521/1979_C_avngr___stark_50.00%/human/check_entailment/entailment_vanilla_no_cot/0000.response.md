To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

### Problem Analysis

The key requirement is to distribute the bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
for each \(i\), where \(k_i\) is the multiplier for the \(i\)-th outcome.

This implies:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \implies \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i \]
\[ \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i \]

A solution involves finding \(x_i\) such that the above inequality holds for all \(i\).

### Program Analysis

The program calculates a common multiple of the multipliers \(k_i\) and uses it to determine the bets \(x_i\). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_i\):**

   ```python
   m = 1
   for i in range(n):
       m = m * k[i]
   ```

   This is not the LCM but the product of all \(k_i\). However, it can still be used as a common multiple.

2. **Determine the bets \(x_i\):**

   ```python
   c = []
   for i in range(n):
       c.append(int(m / k[i]))
   ```

   Here, \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\). This ensures that \(k_i \cdot c_i = m\).

3. **Simplify the bets by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the \(c_i\):**

   ```python
   hcf = func_1(c)
   for i in range(n):
       c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)
   ```

   This step ensures that the bets are as small as possible while maintaining the condition that \(k_i \cdot c_i = m\).

4. **Check if the total bets are less than \(m\):**

   ```python
   if sum(c) >= m / hcf:
       print(-1)
   else:
       for i in range(n):
           print(c[i], end=' ')
       print('')
   ```

   This step checks if the total bets are less than the common multiple \(m\). If not, it prints `-1`.

### Conclusion

The program attempts to distribute the bets such that the total bets are less than the common multiple \(m\). However, the condition `sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect. It should be `sum(c) < m / hcf` to ensure that the bets meet the problem's requirements.

### Correctness

Since the condition `sum(c) >= m / hcf` is incorrect, the program may incorrectly output `-1` in cases where a valid distribution exists. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
