The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since no loop is specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect in this context. Therefore, none of the variables are affected, and the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` - 1; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`. The current value of `hd` is greater than or equal to 0.**
