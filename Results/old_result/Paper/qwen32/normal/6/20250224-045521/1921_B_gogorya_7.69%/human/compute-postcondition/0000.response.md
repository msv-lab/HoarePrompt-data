Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; `s` and `f` are strings of length `n`, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Natural Language: The variable `t` has been assigned the value of an input integer within the range 1 to 10,000. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `f`) and their conditions remain unchanged as they have not been affected by the executed code.
