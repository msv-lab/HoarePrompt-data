Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the new input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in the new `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in the new `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is updated to be the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
