Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` and `s2` are new input strings; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `res` is incremented by 1; `hd` is calculated based on the conditions provided; `i` is 2; `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` are the characters at index 2 in `s1` and `s2` respectively. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decreased by 1 and the loop continues to the next iteration.**

Explanation: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
