The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`, and `hd` is greater than 0.**
