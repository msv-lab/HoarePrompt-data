Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` and `s2` are the new input strings, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, and `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`. The current character at index `i` in `s1` is '1' and the current character at index `i` in `s2` is '0'. If `hd` (which is `a1 - a2`) is greater than 0, then `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1`.**
