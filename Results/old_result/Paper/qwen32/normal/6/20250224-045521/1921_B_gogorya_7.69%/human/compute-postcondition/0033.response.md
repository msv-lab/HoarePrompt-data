The code snippet `s1 = input()` changes the value of `s1` to the new input string provided. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is an input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in the new `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is 0 if `a1 - a2` iterations have occurred where `hd` was greater than 0, otherwise `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)` plus the count of positions `i` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'**.
