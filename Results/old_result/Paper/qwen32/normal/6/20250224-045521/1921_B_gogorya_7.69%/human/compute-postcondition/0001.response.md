The only variable in the loop head of the provided for loop is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used just for iteration, we don't need to adjust its state. The loop will execute `t` times, so `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at all.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

The state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is within the valid range for the loop to execute. Since `t` is already described as being within the range 1 to 10^4, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself, but we need to ensure that the loop can start with this `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
