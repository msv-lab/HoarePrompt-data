The code snippet assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the elements of the list `r, l` respectively. The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`, `r` is `[i, j]`, `l` is `[i, j]`**

In natural language, the output state is: `lst` remains a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` and `j` retain their values as `len(lst) - 2` and `len(lst) - 1` respectively, `sm` keeps its calculated value, and `r` and `l` are both assigned the list `[i, j]`.
