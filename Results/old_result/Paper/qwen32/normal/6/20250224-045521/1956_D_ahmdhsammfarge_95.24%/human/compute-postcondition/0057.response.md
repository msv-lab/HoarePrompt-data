To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the behavior of the given nested loop.

The outer loop iterates over each element in the list `lst` with index `i`. The inner loop iterates over each element in the list `lst` with index `j` such that `j > i`. For each pair `(i, j)`, the code calculates a value `sm` and updates `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` if `sm` is greater than the current `over_sum`.

The value `sm` is calculated as:
\[ sm = \text{sum}(\text{lst}[:i]) + \text{sum}(\text{lst}[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)^2 \]

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `lst` is a list of non-negative integers.
   - `r` and `l` are initialized to `0`.
   - `over_sum` is initialized to the sum of all elements in `lst`.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - Iterates over each element in `lst` with index `i`.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - Iterates over each element in `lst` with index `j` such that `j > i`.
   - For each pair `(i, j)`, it calculates `sm` and updates `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.

After all iterations, `r` and `l` will hold the indices that maximize `sm`, and `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of `sm` encountered.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After the first iteration, `i` and `j` are both `len(lst) - 1`.
- After the second iteration, `r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]` if a higher `sm` is found.
- After the third iteration, `i` is `0` and `r` and `l` are `[0, j]` where `j` maximizes `sm`.

After all iterations, the final `r` and `l` will be the pair of indices that maximize `sm`, and `over_sum` will be the maximum `sm` found.

**Output State: **`r` and `l` are the indices `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`, and `over_sum` is the maximum `sm` found.**

In natural language: The output state after all iterations is that `r` and `l` are the indices of the pair `(i, j)` that maximize the calculated value `sm`, and `over_sum` holds the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the iterations.
