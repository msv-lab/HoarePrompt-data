The only variables in the loop head are `j`, `i`, and `len(lst)`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on these variables. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `i` is 0, and `len(lst)` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` starts from `i + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration). Therefore, `j` will be 2. The values of `i` and `len(lst)` remain the same.

Here is the adjusted state for the start of the next iteration of the loop:

State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `r` is 0, `l` is 1 if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `l` remains 0, `over_sum` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4` if `sm > over_sum`, otherwise `over_sum` remains the sum of the elements in `lst`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[2:]) + 4`, `j` is 2**
