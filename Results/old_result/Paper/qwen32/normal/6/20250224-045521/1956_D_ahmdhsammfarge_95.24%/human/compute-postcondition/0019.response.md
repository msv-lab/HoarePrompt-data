To determine the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, let's first understand the loop's behavior and how the variables evolve.

The loop iterates over the list `lst` with the outer variable `i` starting from 0 and the inner variable `j` starting from `i + 1`. For each pair `(i, j)`, it calculates the sum `sm` which includes:
- The sum of elements before index `i`
- The sum of elements after index `j`
- The square of the distance `(j - i + 1) ** 2`

If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, it updates `over_sum` to `sm` and sets `r` to `i` and `l` to `j`.

Given the initial state and the provided output states for the first 3 iterations, we can infer that the loop runs for `len(lst) - 1` iterations since `j` starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `len(lst) - 1`.

Let's assume the length of `lst` is `n`. The loop will run `n - 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be `n - 1` and `j` will have gone through all possible values from `i + 1` to `n - 1`.

After all iterations, the final values of `r` and `l` will be the indices that maximize `sm`. `over_sum` will be the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop.

Here is the final output state in the required format:

Output State: **lst is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, r and l are the indices that maximize sm, over_sum is the maximum value of sm encountered, i is len(lst) - 1, j is len(lst) - 1.**

In natural language: After the loop has finished executing, `r` and `l` will be the indices that result in the maximum value of `sm`, `over_sum` will be this maximum value, `i` will be the last index of the list, and `j` will also be the last index of the list during the final iteration.
