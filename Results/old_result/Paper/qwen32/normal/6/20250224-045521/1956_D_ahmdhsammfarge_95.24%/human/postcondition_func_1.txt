The function `func_2` takes three parameters: `r` and `l`, which are integers satisfying 0 <= l <= r < n, and `ops`, which is a list that stores operations performed. It modifies the list `ops` by appending operations in a specific pattern based on the values of `r` and `l`. The function does not return anything.
