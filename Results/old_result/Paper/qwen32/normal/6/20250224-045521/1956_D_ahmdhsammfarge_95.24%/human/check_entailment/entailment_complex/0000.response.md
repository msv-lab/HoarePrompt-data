### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given Python program and its functions to determine if they meet the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` by performing a series of operations where each operation involves setting a subarray to its MEX (minimum excluded value).
- The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
- The operations are performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times.
- The program should output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

#### Analysis of the Provided Code:

1. **Function `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the subarray `[i, j]` that maximizes the sum of elements outside the subarray plus the square of the length of the subarray.
   - The logic in `func_1` seems correct for the purpose of finding such a subarray, but it has a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the nested loops and sum calculations, which is inefficient for large `n` (though `n` is bounded by 18, this is still a concern for larger inputs).
   - The function returns the indices `[i, j]` that maximize the sum `sm`.

2. **Function `func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
   - This function is supposed to append operations to `ops` in a specific pattern.
   - The function is recursive and seems intended to generate operations that might be needed to set the subarray to its MEX, but it doesn't directly contribute to maximizing the sum in a clear manner.
   - The function doesn't seem to be directly related to the core logic of maximizing the sum.

3. **Function `func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`**:
   - This function performs the main operation of setting the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to its MEX.
   - It appends operations to `ops` and then modifies `lst` to set all elements in the range `[r, l]` to `n` (the length of the subarray).
   - The function returns the modified list `lst`.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program initializes the list `lst` from the input and an empty list `ops` for operations.
   - It repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the subarray that maximizes the sum and then calls `func_3` to perform the operation.
   - After all possible operations, it tries to set any remaining zeros to 1 and appends the corresponding operations.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum sum and the operations.

#### Key Issues:
- The logic in `func_2` is unclear and doesn't seem to contribute to the core task of maximizing the sum.
- The overall approach in the main program seems to be correct in terms of finding the subarray and performing the operations, but the recursive nature of `func_2` and the inefficiency of `func_1` are concerning.
- The program correctly handles the case where the sum cannot be increased further by checking for zeros and setting them to 1.

#### Conclusion:
Despite some inefficiencies and unclear parts, the given program seems to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array and generate the sequence of operations. The core functionality of finding the subarray and performing the operations appears to be correct.

### Correctness: **True**
