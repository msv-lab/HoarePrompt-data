The code snippet assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Therefore, the value of `over_sum` will be equal to `sm`.

Given the initial state, the values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, `sm`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged except for the new variable `over_sum` which is introduced and assigned the value of `sm`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst)`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + 1`, `r` is `len(lst) - 2`, `l` is `len(lst)`, `over_sum` is `sm`**.
