To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how the variables evolve.

The loop iterates over `j` from `i + 1` to `len(lst) - 1`. Given that `i` is initialized to `len(lst) - 1`, the loop will not execute at all because the range `range(i + 1, len(lst))` is empty when `i` is `len(lst) - 1`.

However, based on the problem description, we assume `i` starts at `len(lst) - 2` and `j` iterates from `len(lst) - 1` to `len(lst) - 1`, which means the loop will execute only once with `j` being `len(lst) - 1`. But the description also mentions the states after the first 3 iterations, suggesting that `i` is `len(lst) - 2` and `j` iterates from `len(lst) - 1` to `len(lst) - 3` in reverse order, which is not the case with the given loop code. 

Given the loop as provided, it will only execute for `j` in the range `len(lst) - 1` to `len(lst) - 1`, meaning only one iteration if `i` is `len(lst) - 2`. The loop will compute `sm` and potentially update `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` based on the condition `if sm > over_sum`.

Let's assume the loop is intended to iterate over `j` from `len(lst) - 1` down to `i + 1` (which would be `len(lst) - 1` down to `len(lst) - 1` if `i` is `len(lst) - 2`), and we need to determine the final state after all iterations.

The loop computes `sm` as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` and updates `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, the final state will be determined by the maximum `sm` encountered during the loop iterations.

Let's assume the list `lst` has `n` elements. The loop will iterate from `j = len(lst) - 1` down to `j = i + 1` (which is `len(lst) - 1` if `i` is `len(lst) - 2`). The final state will be the state where `sm` is maximized.

Let's calculate the final state using the given loop:

1. Initialize `i` to `len(lst) - 2`.
2. Initialize `j` to `len(lst) - 1`.
3. Compute `sm` and update `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.

Let's assume the list `lst` has elements `[a0, a1, ..., an-1]`. The initial state is `i = n - 2`, `j = n - 1`, and `over_sum` is the initial maximum sum encountered.

The loop will compute `sm` as `sum(lst[:n-2]) + sum(lst[n:]) + (n-1 - (n-2) + 1) ** 2 = sum(lst[:n-2]) + 0 + 4 = sum(lst[:n-2]) + 4`.

If `sum(lst[:n-2]) + 4` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` and `l` will be updated to `[n-2, n-1]` and `over_sum` will be updated to `sum(lst[:n-2]) + 4`.

Let's assume the initial `over_sum` is 0 for simplicity. The final state will be:

- `r` and `l` will be `[n-2, n-1]` if `sum(lst[:n-2]) + 4` is greater than the initial `over_sum`.
- `over_sum` will be `sum(lst[:n-2]) + 4` if `sum(lst[:n-2]) + 4` is greater than the initial `over_sum`.

Given the problem's constraints and the loop's behavior, the final state after all iterations is:

Output State: **`r` and `l` are `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]` and `over_sum` is `sum(lst[:len(lst) - 2]) + 4` if `sum(lst[:len(lst) - 2]) + 4` is greater than the initial `over_sum`. Otherwise, `r` and `l` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the final output state is that `r` and `l` will be set to the indices `[len(lst) - 2, len(lst) - 1]` if the computed `sm` is greater than the initial `over_sum`. The `over_sum` will be updated to this new `sm` value. If not, `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
