The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variables `r` and `l`, respectively. Given that `i` is 0, `r` will be 0, and `l` will be `j`.

The other variables (`over_sum`, `sm`, and the condition regarding `sm` and `over_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is 0, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is `sm` if `sm` is greater than the initial `over_sum`; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**
