Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using the allowed operations. Here are some issues with the code:

1. **Logic in `func_1`**: The function is supposed to find the optimal subarray to perform the operation on to maximize the sum. However, the current implementation calculates the sum including a square of the length of the subarray which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the MEX of the subarray and see if replacing the subarray with this MEX increases the sum.

2. **Recursive calls in `func_2`**: This function is supposed to generate the sequence of operations. However, the recursive calls do not seem to make logical sense for generating the operations needed to replace a subarray with its MEX.

3. **Implementation in `func_3`**: This function is supposed to perform the operation on the subarray and update the list and the operations list. However, it incorrectly appends operations and does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray.

4. **Handling of MEX**: The program does not correctly compute the MEX of any subarray. The MEX should be computed as the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and this value should be used to replace the subarray.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is False.
