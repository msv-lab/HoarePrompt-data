Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `lst` except the last two elements, plus 4. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is set to `len(lst) - 2` and `l` is set to `len(lst) - 1`. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, then `r` and `l` are not defined.**
