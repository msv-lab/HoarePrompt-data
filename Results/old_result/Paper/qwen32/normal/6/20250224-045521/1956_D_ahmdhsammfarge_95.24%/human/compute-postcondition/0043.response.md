The code snippet assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Given that `sm` is greater than the initial `over_sum`, `over_sum` will now hold the value of `sm`. The values of `r`, `l`, `i`, and the initial `over_sum` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`r` and `l` are `[0, j]`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j + 1)`**
