You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

    return r, l
    #The program returns the indices `[i, j]` that maximize `sm`, where `r` is `i` and `l` is `j`. The maximum `sm` found is `over_sum`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of non-negative integers and returns a tuple of indices `[i, j]` that define a subarray. The subarray is chosen such that the sum of the elements outside the subarray plus the square of the length of the subarray is maximized.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` takes three parameters: `r` and `l`, which are integers satisfying 0 <= l <= r < n, and `ops`, which is a list that stores operations performed. It modifies the list `ops` by appending operations in a specific pattern based on the values of `r` and `l`. The function does not return anything.

    return lst
    #The program returns the list `lst` where the elements from index `r` to `l` are all equal to `n`, and `n` is `l - r + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies a list `lst` by setting all elements in the range from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the range (`l - r + 1`). It also records operations in the list `ops`. The function returns the modified list `lst`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues:

### Issues in the Code:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the best subarray to replace with its MEX value. However, it does not compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it calculates a sum based on some arbitrary formula (`sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`) and tries to maximize it. This is not what the problem requires.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function seems to be recursively adding operations, but the logic is unclear and does not align with the problem's requirements. It does not ensure that the operations are maximizing the sum of the array.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to replace the subarray with its MEX value, but the logic is flawed. It does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and instead replaces the subarray with the length of the subarray (`n = l - r + 1`), which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Compute the MEX of the entire array.
2. Replace subarrays with their MEX values to maximize the sum.
3. Ensure that the operations do not exceed the limit of \(5 \times 10^5\).

### Example Case Where the Code Fails:
Consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the provided code does not produce this output. Instead, it will likely produce an incorrect sequence of operations and an incorrect maximum sum because it does not correctly compute and apply the MEX operation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and does not correctly compute the maximum sum of the array by replacing subarrays with their MEX values. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
