The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the value of `i` to `r` and the value of `j` to `l`. 

Given the initial state, the values of `i` and `j` are not explicitly mentioned. However, we know that `r` and `l` were previously assigned values based on the condition involving `sm` and `over_sum`. After executing the code snippet, `r` and `l` are now directly assigned to `i` and `j` respectively. The values of `over_sum`, `sm`, and the condition that determined the initial values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is `sm` if `sm` is greater than the initial `over_sum`; otherwise, it remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`**
