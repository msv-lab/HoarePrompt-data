Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement. Here are a few issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The problem statement describes a specific binary search algorithm, but the provided code does not follow it. Specifically, the condition in the while loop should be `while l < r` and the update rules for `l` and `r` are different.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The logic to determine if a swap is needed and which elements to swap is incorrect. The program only checks if the final `l` from the binary search matches the index of `x` in the array, and it does not consider the possibility of performing two swaps to achieve the desired result.

3. **Output Format**: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of swaps and the specific swaps needed, but it incorrectly prints the number of swaps and returns the swap indices in a way that does not match the problem's output format requirements.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The main loop correctly handles multiple test cases, but the function `func_1` does not return the correct output format for each test case.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly implement the binary search as described in the problem statement, determine the correct swaps needed to make `p_l` equal to `x` after at most two swaps, and ensure the output format is correct for each test case.
