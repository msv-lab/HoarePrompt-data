The value of `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, the new value of `l` becomes `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of the `array`, `l` is `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `(n - 1) // 2`, and `array[mid]` is less than `find`**.
