The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `l` and the value `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The other variables (`array`, `find`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of the `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**
