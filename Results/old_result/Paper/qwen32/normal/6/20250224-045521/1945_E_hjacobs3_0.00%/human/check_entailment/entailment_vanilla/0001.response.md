Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to perform a binary search on a permutation `p` of size `n` to find a number `x`. However, before performing the binary search, we can perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that after the binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. The binary search algorithm provided in the problem description is slightly different from the standard binary search in that it finds the largest index `l` such that `p[l] <= x`.

### Program Analysis

The given program consists of a main loop that processes multiple test cases, and a function `func_1` that implements the logic to determine the swaps needed.

#### Main Loop:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, reads `n` and `x`, and then reads the permutation `array`.
- Calls `func_1` with `array` and `x` as arguments.
- Prints the result returned by `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- Implements a binary search to find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= x`.
- If the element at index `l` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` and suggests a swap to bring `x` to index `l`.
- If the element at index `l` is already `x`, it prints `0`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The loop condition `while l <= r` should be `while l < r` to match the binary search logic described in the problem. 
   - The calculation of `mid` is correct, but the way `l` and `r` are updated is incorrect. The problem specifies `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`, and then `l = m` if `array[m] <= x` and `r = m` otherwise. The provided code does not match this logic.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of strings representing the swaps needed, but it directly prints the number of swaps and the swap indices. This is inconsistent with the problem's output requirements.

3. **Handling the Case When `x` is Not Found**:
   - The problem guarantees that `x` will be in the permutation, so the case where `x` is not found should not occur. However, the program does not handle this case explicitly.

4. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program suggests a single swap to bring `x` to index `l`, but it does not consider the possibility of using up to 2 swaps as required by the problem.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the binary search implementation, output handling, and the logic for determining the swaps, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
