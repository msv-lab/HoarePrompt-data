You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to n, and find is an integer (1 ≤ find ≤ n) that needs to be found in the permutation. The function is called multiple times for different test cases, with the total sum of n values across all test cases not exceeding 2·10^5.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`. `r` is `l - 1`.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two string elements: the first element is the string representation of `l + 1`, and the second element is the string representation of `array.index(find) + 1`.
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`. `r` is `l - 1`. `l` is equal to `array.index(find)` if `find` is present in `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `array`, which is a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find` within that range. It returns a list containing two string elements: the first is the 1-based index of the smallest element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second is the 1-based index of `find` in `array`. If `find` is not found in `array`, the behavior as described in the comments is not consistent with the return postcondition, but based on the return postcondition, it still returns the indices as specified.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to see if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to perform a binary search on a permutation `p` of size `n` to find a number `x`. However, before performing the binary search, we can perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that after the binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`. The binary search algorithm provided in the problem description is slightly different from the standard binary search in that it finds the largest index `l` such that `p[l] <= x`.

### Program Analysis

The given program consists of a main loop that processes multiple test cases, and a function `func_1` that implements the logic to determine the swaps needed.

#### Main Loop:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, reads `n` and `x`, and then reads the permutation `array`.
- Calls `func_1` with `array` and `x` as arguments.
- Prints the result returned by `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- Implements a binary search to find the largest index `l` such that `array[l] <= x`.
- If the element at index `l` is not equal to `x`, it prints `1` and suggests a swap to bring `x` to index `l`.
- If the element at index `l` is already `x`, it prints `0`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The loop condition `while l <= r` should be `while l < r` to match the binary search logic described in the problem. 
   - The calculation of `mid` is correct, but the way `l` and `r` are updated is incorrect. The problem specifies `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`, and then `l = m` if `array[m] <= x` and `r = m` otherwise. The provided code does not match this logic.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of strings representing the swaps needed, but it directly prints the number of swaps and the swap indices. This is inconsistent with the problem's output requirements.

3. **Handling the Case When `x` is Not Found**:
   - The problem guarantees that `x` will be in the permutation, so the case where `x` is not found should not occur. However, the program does not handle this case explicitly.

4. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program suggests a single swap to bring `x` to index `l`, but it does not consider the possibility of using up to 2 swaps as required by the problem.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the binary search implementation, output handling, and the logic for determining the swaps, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
