To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to make sure that the condition `l <= r` is satisfied. Given the initial state where `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, we need to verify if this condition holds true.

In the provided state:
- `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`).
- `n` is the length of the `array`.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1`.

The condition `l <= r` translates to `0 <= n - 1`. This inequality is always true for any positive value of `n` (since `n` is at least 1).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `l` and `r` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^5) containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of the `array`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
