### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using a modified binary search.
- We can perform up to 2 swaps to position `x` correctly before running the binary search.
- The binary search algorithm finds the largest index `l` such that `p[l] <= x`.

#### Code Analysis
The provided code attempts to implement the solution but has several issues:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The loop condition `while l <= r` is incorrect. It should be `while l < r` to correctly implement binary search.
   - The updates to `l` and `r` are incorrect. The problem specifies `m = floor((r + l) / 2)`, and then `l = m` if `array[m] <= x` and `r = m` otherwise. The provided code does not match this logic.

2. **Output Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` directly prints the number of swaps and the swap indices. It should return the list of strings representing the swaps as specified.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program only suggests a single swap to bring `x` to index `l`. It does not consider the possibility of using up to 2 swaps as required by the problem.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm the state of the program before and after the function call. However, they do not address the issues with the binary search implementation and the swapping logic.

#### Annotations and State Validation
- The annotations state that `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, or `l` is `n` if `find` is greater than all elements in `array`. `r` is `l - 1`.
- This state is incorrect based on the problem's binary search logic. The correct state should be that `l` is the largest index such that `array[l] <= x`.

#### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the binary search implementation, output handling, and the logic for determining the swaps, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
