Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `array`, which is a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n, and an integer `find` within that range. It returns a list containing two string elements: the first is the 1-based index of the smallest element in `array` that is greater than or equal to `find`, and the second is the 1-based index of `find` in `array`. If `find` is not found in `array`, the behavior as described in the comments is not consistent with the return postcondition, but based on the return postcondition, it still returns the indices as specified.**
