The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the variables `l` and `r` and their relationship to the `array` and `find` values, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement. The `print(1)` statement is independent of these variables.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state describes the conditions and values of `l` and `r` in relation to `array` and `find`.
2. The `print(1)` statement is executed regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `array`, or `find`.
3. The `print(1)` statement will output the integer `1`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
