Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are a few issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search is implemented incorrectly. The condition `if array[mid] >= find` and the updates to `l` and `r` do not correctly reflect the binary search algorithm. The correct condition should be `if array[mid] < find` to properly narrow down the search space.
   - The loop condition should be `while l < r` instead of `while l <= r` to correctly handle the binary search.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Swaps**:
   - The code attempts to swap elements only if the final `l` does not match the index of `find` in the array. However, the problem requires performing at most 2 swaps to make the binary search algorithm find the correct element.
   - The code does not consider the possibility of performing two swaps to achieve the desired result.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is incorrect. The code prints the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps directly, but the problem requires the number of operations on the first line and the operations on the subsequent lines.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the permutation is already sorted or where multiple swaps are necessary to place the target element in the correct position for the binary search to find it.

Here is a potential test case where the code fails:

**Input**:
```
1
6 5
3 1 6 5 2 4
```

**Expected Output**:
```
1
3 4
```

**Actual Output**:
```
1
5 4
```

The code incorrectly identifies the swap indices, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
