Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

Initial State:
- `T` is greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
print('Alice')
```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

The variable `T`, the integers `a` and `b`, and the incremented `i` are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Output: **Alice**
