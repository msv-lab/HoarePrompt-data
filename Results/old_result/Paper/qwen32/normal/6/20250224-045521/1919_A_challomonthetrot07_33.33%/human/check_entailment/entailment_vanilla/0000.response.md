To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the program step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The game revolves around the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The key points are:

1. Players take turns, with Alice starting.
2. In each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not.
3. After possibly swapping, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
4. The game ends when a player cannot make a move (i.e., when both wallets are empty).

The optimal strategy involves understanding the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of coins in each wallet:

- **If both wallets have the same number of coins**, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves, ensuring he wins.
- **If one of the wallets has exactly one coin**, the player with the single coin will be forced to make the last move and lose.
- **If both wallets have an odd number of coins**, the second player can force a win by mirroring the first player's moves.
- **If one wallet has an even number of coins and the other has an odd number of coins**, the first player can force a win by ensuring that the second player is always left with an even-even or odd-odd situation.
- **If both wallets have an even number of coins**, the second player can force a win by mirroring the first player's moves.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the program's logic:

1. **If `a == b`**: The program correctly outputs "Bob" because the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's moves.
2. **If `a == 1`**: The program correctly outputs "Alice" because Alice will be forced to make the last move and lose.
3. **If `b == 1`**: The program correctly outputs "Bob" because Bob will be forced to make the last move and lose.
4. **If `a % 2 == 1`**: The program outputs "Bob". This is incorrect because if `a` is odd and `b` is even, Alice can force a win.
5. **If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**: The program correctly outputs "Alice" because Alice can force a win.
6. **If `a > b`**: The program outputs "Bob". This is incorrect because the comparison alone does not determine the winner; the parity of the numbers does.
7. **Else (implied `a < b`)**: The program outputs "Alice". This is incorrect for the same reason as above.

### Conclusion

The program's logic is flawed in several cases, particularly in determining the winner based on the comparison of `a` and `b` without considering the parity of the numbers. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: False**
