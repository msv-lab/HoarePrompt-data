The code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`. The initial state of `T`, `a`, `b`, and `i` is provided. After the execution of the code, `a` and `b` will hold the new values read from the input, while `T` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1.**
