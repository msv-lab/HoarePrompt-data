You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` and prints the name of the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on specific conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns playing with their wallets containing a and b coins, respectively. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, i.e., when both wallets have zero coins. Both players play optimally.

The key points to consider are:
1. The player who starts the game (Alice) will try to win.
2. If both wallets have the same number of coins, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's move and win.
3. If one of the wallets has only one coin, the player whose turn it is will lose because they have to take out one coin, leaving the other player with a non-zero number of coins.
4. If the number of coins in Alice's wallet is odd, Bob can always make the number of coins in Alice's wallet even after Alice's turn, ensuring Bob's victory.
5. If the number of coins in Alice's wallet is even and the number of coins in Bob's wallet is odd, Alice can make the number of coins in Bob's wallet even after her turn, ensuring Alice's victory.
6. If Alice has more coins than Bob, the parity of the coins plays a significant role in determining the winner.

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the conditions in the program:
1. `if a == b: print('Bob')`
   - This condition is correct because if both wallets have the same number of coins, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and win.
2. `elif a == 1: print('Alice')`
   - This condition is incorrect. If Alice has 1 coin, she will lose because she must take out the coin, leaving Bob with all the coins.
3. `elif b == 1: print('Bob')`
   - This condition is correct. If Bob has 1 coin, Alice will take out her coin, and Bob will take out his, leaving Alice with no valid move.
4. `elif a % 2 == 1: print('Bob')`
   - This condition is correct. If Alice's wallet has an odd number of coins, Bob can always make it even after Alice's turn, ensuring Bob's victory.
5. `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1: print('Alice')`
   - This condition is correct. If Alice's wallet has an even number of coins and Bob's wallet has an odd number of coins, Alice can make Bob's wallet even after her turn, ensuring Alice's victory.
6. `elif a > b: print('Bob')`
   - This condition is incorrect. The number of coins in Alice's wallet being greater than Bob's does not necessarily mean Bob wins. The parity of the coins is more critical.
7. `else: print('Alice')`
   - This condition is incorrect. The `else` case does not cover all scenarios correctly. For example, it does not handle the case where `a < b` and the parity of coins is not considered.

### Conclusion:
The program has several incorrect conditions that do not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play of both players.
