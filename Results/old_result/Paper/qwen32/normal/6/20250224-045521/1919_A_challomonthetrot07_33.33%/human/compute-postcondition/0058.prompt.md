Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, there are two integers `a` and `b` such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9; `T` is the input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(T):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a == b:
        print('Bob')
    elif a == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif b == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 1:
        print('Bob')
    elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    elif a > b:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is equal to `b`, their values remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` retains its parity, and `b` retains its parity unless `b` is 1, in which case it remains 1. If `a` is greater than `b` and `a` is even, then `a` is greater than `b`. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. The relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged regardless of whether `a` equals `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` equals `b`, the actions specified in the if block are taken. Otherwise, if `a` equals 1 or `b` equals 1, the actions specified in the if block are taken. If neither `a` nor `b` equals 1 and `a` does not equal `b`, the actions specified in the else block are taken. The relationship between `a` and `b` remains unspecified as it does not affect the postcondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
