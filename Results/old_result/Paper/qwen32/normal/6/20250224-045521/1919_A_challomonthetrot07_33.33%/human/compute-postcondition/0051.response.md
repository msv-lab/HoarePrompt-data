In the given initial state, there is no mention of any variables or conditions that directly influence the `print('Alice')` statement. The statement simply prints the string 'Alice' regardless of the values of `T`, `a`, `b`, or `i`. 

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state mentions that `T` is greater than 0, but this does not affect the print statement.
2. The variables `a` and `b` are new integers read from the input, but they are not used in the print statement.
3. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but this also does not affect the print statement.

Given this, the print statement will output the string 'Alice' exactly as it is written.

Output: **Alice**
