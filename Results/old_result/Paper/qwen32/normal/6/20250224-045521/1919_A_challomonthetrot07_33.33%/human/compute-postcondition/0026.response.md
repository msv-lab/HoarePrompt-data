Postcondition: **T is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are integers, and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is 1, the value of `b` remains unchanged and is not equal to 1. If `a` is not 1, `a` retains its parity (odd or even), and `b` retains its parity unless `b` is 1, in which case it remains 1. If `a` is greater than `b` and `a` is even, then `a` is greater than `b`. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `b`.**
