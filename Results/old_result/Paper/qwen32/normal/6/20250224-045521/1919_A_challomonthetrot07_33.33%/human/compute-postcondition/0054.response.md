Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `a` is odd, the actions specified in the if block are taken. Otherwise, if `a` is even, the actions specified in the else block are taken. The relationship between `a` and `b` remains unspecified as it does not affect the postcondition.**
