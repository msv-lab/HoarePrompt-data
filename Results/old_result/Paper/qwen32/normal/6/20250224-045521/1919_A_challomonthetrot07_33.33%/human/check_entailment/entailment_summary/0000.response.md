Let's analyze the given program and the problem description to determine if the program is correct.

The game revolves around the number of coins each player has in their wallets and the rules for swapping and removing coins. The key to solving this problem is to understand the optimal strategy for both players.

Here are the key observations and rules derived from the problem description:

1. If `a == b`, the game can be analyzed as a symmetric game. Since Alice starts, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice to lose. Thus, Bob wins.
2. If `a == 1`, Alice cannot swap wallets and must remove her only coin, leaving Bob with `b` coins. Bob can then remove all his coins, making Alice unable to make a move. Thus, Alice loses.
3. If `b == 1`, Alice can swap wallets with Bob, leaving herself with 1 coin and Bob with `a-1` coins. Alice can then remove her coin, leaving Bob with `a-1` coins. Bob cannot swap back to Alice's wallet because it is empty. Bob must remove his coins one by one, eventually losing. Thus, Alice wins.
4. If `a % 2 == 1` (i.e., `a` is odd), Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring that the game reduces to a state where `a == b` or `b == 1` on Bob's turn. This is because Alice can always make the number of coins in her wallet even after her turn, and Bob will be forced to face an odd number of coins, eventually leading to a losing position.
5. If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1` (i.e., `a` is even and `b` is odd), Alice can swap wallets to make `b` even and `a` odd. Bob will then face an odd number of coins in his wallet, and Alice can continue to force Bob into a losing position.
6. If `a > b` and `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring that the game reduces to a state where `a == b` on Bob's turn. Alice can do this by swapping wallets when necessary to maintain an even number of coins in her wallet.
7. If `a < b` and `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`, Bob can mirror Alice's moves and force Alice into a losing position.

Let's evaluate the given program against these rules:

- The condition `if a == b: print('Bob')` correctly identifies the symmetric case where Bob wins.
- The condition `elif a == 1: print('Alice')` incorrectly identifies the case where Alice loses. It should be `elif a == 1: print('Bob')`.
- The condition `elif b == 1: print('Bob')` incorrectly identifies the case where Bob loses. It should be `elif b == 1: print('Alice')`.
- The condition `elif a % 2 == 1: print('Bob')` incorrectly identifies the case where Bob wins. It should be `elif a % 2 == 1: print('Alice')`.
- The condition `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1: print('Alice')` correctly identifies the case where Alice wins.
- The conditions `elif a > b: print('Bob')` and `else: print('Alice')` are not correctly identifying the optimal moves for all cases.

Based on this analysis, the given program is incorrect.

Reasoning: The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly the cases where `a == 1` and `b == 1`, and the cases where `a % 2 == 1`.

Correctness: **False**
