Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input; `i` is incremented by 1. If `b` is 1, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `a` is odd, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the relationship between `a` and `b` remains unchanged, whether `a` is greater than `b` or not.**
