Output State: **The loop has executed `T` times, and for each pair of integers `a` and `b` read from the input, the program has printed the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the given conditions. The variables `a` and `b` hold the values of the last pair processed, and `i` equals `T`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all `T` iterations, the program will have printed the result for each test case (either 'Alice' or 'Bob') based on the provided conditions. The variables `a` and `b` will contain the values of the last test case processed, and the loop counter `i` will be equal to `T`, indicating that all iterations have been completed.
