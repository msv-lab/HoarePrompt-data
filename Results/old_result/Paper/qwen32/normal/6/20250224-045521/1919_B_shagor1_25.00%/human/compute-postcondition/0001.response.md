The code snippet `s = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'. After executing the code, the value of `s` will be updated to the input string provided during execution.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string `s`. The next line contains a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string.**
