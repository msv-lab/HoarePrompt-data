To determine the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how the variable `neg` is updated.

The loop iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`. If the character `i` is `'-'`, it increments the variable `neg` by 1. Otherwise, `neg` remains unchanged. This means that `neg` will count the total number of `'-'` characters in the string `s`.

Given that the loop will execute `n` times (once for each character in `s`), the final value of `neg` will be the total number of `'-'` characters in `s`.

Therefore, the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations is that `neg` will be equal to the count of `'-'` characters in the string `s`.

Output State: **`neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.**
