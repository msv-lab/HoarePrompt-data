Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The current implementation only counts the number of '-' characters and calculates a penalty based on that count, which does not account for the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the total penalty as described in the problem.

To solve the problem optimally, one would need to consider different ways of splitting the array and calculate the penalty for each possible split, aiming to find the minimum total penalty. The current approach is too simplistic and does not follow the rules laid out in the problem statement.
