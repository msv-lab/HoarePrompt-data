Reasoning:  
The program is intended to calculate the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array derived from the string `s`. However, the given implementation of `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement. 

The program calculates `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. This formula does not account for the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty, which involves considering the sum and length of subarrays.

The correct approach involves iterating through the string and keeping track of the sum of the elements in the current subarray. When the sum of the current subarray becomes zero, it indicates an optimal split point because the penalty for such a subarray is zero. If the end of the string is reached without the sum becoming zero, the remaining subarray should be considered as a whole.

Given the provided implementation, it fails to achieve the optimal splitting and thus does not compute the correct minimum penalty.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
