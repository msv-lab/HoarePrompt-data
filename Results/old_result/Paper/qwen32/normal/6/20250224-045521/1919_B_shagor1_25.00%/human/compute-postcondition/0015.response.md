Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string `s`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' and '-' characters. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information, but based on typical problem structures, it likely returns a value derived from the string `s` for each test case.**
