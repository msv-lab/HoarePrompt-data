The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the characters in the string `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the current character `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the current character in the string `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the string `s`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
- `i` is the current character in `s`.
- `neg` is 1 if the current character `i` is '-', otherwise `neg` remains 0.

To adjust the state for the next iteration:
- `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

Since we do not have the exact position of `i` in the string `s` from the provided state, we can infer that if `i` was at position `k` in the previous iteration, it should now be at position `k+1`.

However, we can only specify the state in terms of `i` and the given conditions. Therefore, we can say that `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `i` is the next character in `s`, `neg` is 1 if `i` is '-', otherwise `neg` remains 0**.
