You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string s. The next line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. There are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
        
    #State: `neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where `n` is a given integer and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays, where the penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The provided program, however, does not implement this logic. Instead, it counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and computes the output based on the difference between the total length `n` and twice the count of '-' characters. This approach does not consider any splitting of the array or the calculation of penalties for subarrays.

Let's consider the provided examples:

1. For the input `+`, the program correctly outputs `1`, which is the penalty for the single-element array `[1]`.
2. For the input `-----`, the program correctly outputs `5`, which is the penalty for five single-element arrays `[-1]`.
3. For the input `+-+-+-`, the program incorrectly outputs `0`. The correct output should be `0` because we can split it into `([1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1])` with zero penalties for each subarray. However, the logic used in the program does not ensure this optimal split.
4. For the input `--+++++++-`, the program incorrectly outputs `4`. The correct output should be `4`, but the logic used in the program does not ensure this optimal split.
5. For the input `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the program incorrectly outputs `4`. The correct output should be `4`, but the logic used in the program does not ensure this optimal split.

The program's logic does not guarantee the minimum penalty because it does not perform any splitting or penalty calculation based on the described rules. It only uses a formula that happens to give the correct answer for some specific cases, but it does not generalize to all cases.

Thus, the given program is incorrect as it does not implement the required logic for finding the minimum penalty.
