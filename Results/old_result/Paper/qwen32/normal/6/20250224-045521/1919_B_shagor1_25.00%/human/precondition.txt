The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string s. The string s follows, consisting of n characters, each of which is either '+' or '-'. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. There are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.
