You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string s. The next line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'. The number of test cases t is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. There are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
        
    #State: `neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where `n` is a given integer and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of a string `s`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' and '-' characters. The number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly detailed in the provided information, but based on typical problem structures, it likely returns a value derived from the string `s` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
