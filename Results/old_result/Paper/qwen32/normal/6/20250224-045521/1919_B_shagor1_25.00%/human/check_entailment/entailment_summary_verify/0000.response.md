### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to split the array optimally to minimize the total penalty, which is calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by the length of that subarray.

The provided program, however, does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates a value based on the count of '-' characters in the string and the length of the string, specifically using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

Let's analyze the logic and correctness of the program using the provided function summary and the problem description:

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of '-' characters in `s` and stores it in `neg`.
   - It calculates and prints `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`; otherwise, it prints `n`.

2. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
   - The penalty for each subarray is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by the length of the subarray.
   - The optimal split is not considered by the provided program.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example `s = "+-++++"`.
   - The program calculates `n = 6` and `neg = 1`.
   - It then calculates `n - 2 * neg = 6 - 2 * 1 = 4`, which is not the minimum penalty.
   - The optimal split for `s = "+-++++"` would be `([1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0 + 4 = 4`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not follow the optimal splitting process described in the problem statement.
   - The program's logic is incorrect because it does not consider the sum of subarrays and their lengths when calculating the penalty.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect as it does not implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array.
