To determine what will be printed, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State:
- `neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `neg`**: This variable holds the count of '-' characters in the string `s`. Since the string `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `neg`, but we know that `neg` is a non-negative integer representing the count of '-' characters in `s`.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n` is a conditional expression (also known as a ternary operator).
   - It checks if `n` is not equal to `neg`. If true, it evaluates to `n - 2 * neg`. If false, it evaluates to `n`.

3. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - **Scenario 1**: If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the expression evaluates to `n - 2 * neg`.
   - **Scenario 2**: If `n` is equal to `neg`, the expression evaluates to `n`.

### Output:
Since the value of `n` and the string `s` (and thus `neg`) are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical output. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

- If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.
- If `n` is equal to `neg`, the output will be `n`.

Given the above conditions, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where `n` is a given integer and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`)**
