The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` is `n - 2`. After the operation, `ind` becomes `(n - 2) - 2`, which simplifies to `n - 4`. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be at least 1, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are 0 and the last element is `n-2`, `ind` is `n - 4`, `i` is `n` if `n` is even or `n` if `n` is odd**.
