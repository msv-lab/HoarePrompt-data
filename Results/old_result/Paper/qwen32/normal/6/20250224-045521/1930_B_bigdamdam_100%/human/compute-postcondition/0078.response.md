To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop over multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and then constructing a list `p` based on specific rules. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens in each test case:

1. **Initialization**: For each test case, `n` is read from the input.
2. **List Construction**:
   - A list `p` of size `n` is initialized with all elements set to 0.
   - The variable `ind` is set to `n` initially.
   - **Even Indices**: Starting from the first even index (0), `p[i]` is set to `ind` and `ind` is decremented by 2 for each subsequent even index up to the largest even index less than `n`.
   - **Odd Indices**: Starting from the first odd index (1), `p[i]` is set to `ind` and `ind` is incremented by 2 for each subsequent odd index up to the largest odd index less than `n`. The initial value of `ind` for odd indices is `1` if `n` is even and `2` if `n` is odd.

Since the loop executes `t` times, we need to consider the output for each test case independently. The value of `t` does not affect the construction of `p` for each individual test case, only the number of test cases to be processed.

### Output State after All Iterations

For each test case, the list `p` is constructed as follows:
- **Even Indices**: The values at even indices are `n, n-2, n-4, ...,` and so on, decreasing by 2.
- **Odd Indices**: The values at odd indices are `1, 5, 9, ...,` and so on, increasing by 4, starting from `1` if `n` is even and `2` if `n` is odd.

The final output state is a series of lists `p` for each test case, and the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **For each test case, the list `p` is constructed such that `p[2j] = n - 2j` for even indices `2j < n` and `p[2j+1] = 1 + 4k` for odd indices `2j+1 < n` where `k` is the index of the odd position starting from 0. The value of `t` remains the same.**

In simpler terms, for each test case, the even indices of the list `p` are filled with decreasing values starting from `n`, and the odd indices are filled with increasing values starting from `1` or `2` depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively. The number of test cases `t` does not change.
