To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables `p` and `ind`.

The loop iterates over indices `i` in steps of 2, starting from 0, and assigns the current value of `ind` to `p[i]`, then decrements `ind` by 2. This process continues until all valid indices `i` have been processed.

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop assigns `n` to `p[0]`, then `n-2` to `p[2]`, then `n-4` to `p[4]`, and so on.
- The value of `ind` decreases by 2 with each iteration.
- The loop stops when `i` exceeds `n-1`.

The loop will execute `floor(n/2)` times, as it increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, the final state of `p` will have the first `floor(n/2)` elements filled with decreasing values starting from `n` and decrementing by 2 each time, and the rest of the elements will remain 0.

The final value of `ind` will be `n - 2 * floor(n/2)`.

Let's formalize this:

- If `n` is even, the loop will execute `n/2` times, and `ind` will be `n - 2 * (n/2) = 0`.
- If `n` is odd, the loop will execute `(n-1)/2` times, and `ind` will be `n - 2 * ((n-1)/2) = 1`.

Thus, the final output state of `p` will be a list where the first `floor(n/2)` elements are `n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1)`, and the rest are 0. The final value of `ind` will be `0` if `n` is even and `1` if `n` is odd.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the input, `p` is a list where the first floor(n/2) elements are n, n-2, n-4, ..., n-2*(floor(n/2)-1) and the rest are 0, `ind` is 0 if n is even and 1 if n is odd.**
