The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`. After the operation, `ind` becomes `(n - 2) - 2` which simplifies to `n - 4`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first four elements are 0, the fifth element is `n-2`, and all other elements are 0, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`, `i` is 4.**
