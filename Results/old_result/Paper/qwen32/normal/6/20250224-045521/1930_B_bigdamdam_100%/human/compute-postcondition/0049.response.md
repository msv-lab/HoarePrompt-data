`ind` is incremented by 2. Since `ind` was 5 if `n` is even or 6 if `n` is odd, after incrementing by 2, `ind` becomes 7 if `n` is even or 8 if `n` is odd. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1, `p` is a list of `n` elements where `p[2j] = n - 2j` for `j` such that `2j < n`, `p[3] = ind`, `p[5] = ind`, and all other elements are 0, `ind` is 7 if `n` is even or 8 if `n` is odd, `i` is 5.**
