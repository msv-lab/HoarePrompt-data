The given code snippet is `p[i] = ind`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, which means there is an error in the code as it tries to assign a value to an index in the list `p` that has not been specified. Assuming there was a typo and `i` was intended to be `n-1` (the last index of the list `p`), we will proceed with this assumption for the task.

Given this assumption, the value at the last index of the list `p` will be updated to the value of `ind`. Since `ind` is equal to `n`, the last element of the list `p` will be set to `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be at least 1, `p` is a list of `n` elements where the first `n-1` elements are 0 and the last element is `n`, and `ind` is equal to `n`.**
