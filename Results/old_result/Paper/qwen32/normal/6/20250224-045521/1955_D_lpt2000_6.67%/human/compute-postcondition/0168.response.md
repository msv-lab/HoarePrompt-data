Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6; `nabors` is an integer that must be greater than 1; `aa` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements; `bb` is a new list of integers; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`; `tot` is the sum of the values in the dictionary `D`; `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]` and `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. `C`, `D`, `E`, and `fnd` remain as defined in the initial state, except `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot >= k`. `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.** 

In simple terms, the value of `D[in_aa]` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
