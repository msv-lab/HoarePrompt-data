To determine what will be printed by the `print(fnd)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and how the variables are defined and used.

### Initial State Breakdown:

1. **Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`: Integers where `1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5`.
   - `a`, `b`: Lists of integers with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, where each element is between 1 and 10^6.
   - `nabors`: An integer greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state.
   - `aa`, `bb`: Lists of integers obtained from the input.
   - `cnt_aa`: A `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`.
   - `cnt_bb`: A `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`.
   - `D`: A `Counter` object representing the intersection of the last `m` elements of `aa` and `bb`.
   - `E`: A `Counter` object representing the difference of the last `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `bb`.
   - `C`: A `Counter` object representing the difference of the elements in `bb` that are not in the last `m` elements of `aa`.
   - `tot`: The sum of the values in the `Counter` object `D`.
   - `fnd`: This variable is set to `n - m + 1` if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` for all iterations, otherwise it is the number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the iterations.

2. **Logic:**
   - The variable `fnd` is influenced by the condition `tot >= k` across multiple iterations.
   - If `tot` is always greater than or equal to `k` across all iterations, `fnd` is set to `n - m + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `fnd` is the count of iterations where `tot` was greater than or equal to `k`.

### Determining the Output:

Given the complexity of the problem, the exact value of `fnd` depends on the values of `aa`, `bb`, and the constraints provided. However, based on the initial state and the logic described, we can provide a precise description of what `fnd` represents:

- **If `tot >= k` for all iterations:**
  - `fnd` will be `n - m + 1`.
  
- **Otherwise:**
  - `fnd` will be the number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the iterations.

Since the exact values of `aa`, `bb`, and the number of iterations are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `fnd`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `fnd`.

### Final Output:

Output: **fnd (where fnd is the number of times tot was greater than or equal to k during the iterations, or n - m + 1 if tot >= k for all iterations)**
