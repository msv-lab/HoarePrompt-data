The code snippet `C[out_aa] += 1` increases the value of the element in the dictionary `C` at the key `out_aa` by 1. The other variables (`in_aa`, `out_aa`, `D[out_aa]`, `aa`, `m`, `n`) remain unchanged except for the specified modification in `C`.

Output State: **`in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m + 1:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[1:n - m]`, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**
