Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input where 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6; `nabors` is an integer that must be greater than 1; `aa` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `bb` is a new list of integers obtained from the new input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`; `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of the last `m` elements of `aa` and `bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference of the last `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `bb`; `C` is a Counter object representing the difference of the elements in `bb` that are not in the last `m` elements of `aa` and has been updated to `cnt_bb - D`; `tot` is the sum of the values in the Counter object `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `tot` >= `k` else 0; `aa` is a list of integers obtained from the input. `cnt_bb` is updated to count the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
            C[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            D[in_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6; `nabors` is an integer that must be greater than 1; `aa` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements; `bb` is a new list of integers; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`; `tot` is the sum of the values in the dictionary `D`; `in_aa`, `out_aa`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `fnd` remain as defined in the initial state; `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot >= k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6; `nabors` is an integer that must be greater than 1; `aa` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements; `bb` is a new list of integers; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`; `tot` is the sum of the values in the dictionary `D` (recalculated); `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]` and `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `E[out_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. `C`, `D`, `E`, and `fnd` remain as defined in the initial state, except `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot >= k`. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then if `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot >= k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m + 1:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[1:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot >= k` else `fnd` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
