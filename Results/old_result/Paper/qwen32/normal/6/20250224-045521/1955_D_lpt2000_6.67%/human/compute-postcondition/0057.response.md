Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^6; the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5; `nabors` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `aa` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `bb`. If `C[in_aa]` was equal to `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, and if `D[in_aa]` was 0 before the increment, `tot` is incremented by 1. `E` and `C` remain unchanged except for the updates mentioned. `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` >= `k` after any potential increment to `tot`. `in_aa` is `aa[m + i_in + 2]`; `out_aa` is `aa[i_out + 2]`.**
