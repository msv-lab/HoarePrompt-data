To determine what will be printed by the `print(fnd)` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`in_aa`**: This is the value of the last element of the list `aa`, i.e., `aa[n-1]`.
2. **`out_aa`**: This is the value of the element in the list `aa` at the index `n - m - 1`.
3. **`tot`**: This is the sum of the values in the list `D` after all iterations.
4. **`fnd`**: This variable is incremented by 1 for each iteration where the condition `tot >= k` is true.

### Understanding the Variables:
- `in_aa` and `out_aa` are values derived from the list `aa` but are not directly used in the `print(fnd)` statement.
- `tot` is a cumulative sum of values from list `D`, and its value is not directly used in the `print(fnd)` statement either.
- `fnd` is the variable that keeps track of the number of iterations where the cumulative sum `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### The Print Statement:
The `print(fnd)` statement will output the value of `fnd`, which is the count of iterations where the condition `tot >= k` was met.

### Conclusion:
Since the exact number of iterations and the values of `tot` and `k` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `fnd`.

Output: **fnd (where fnd is the number of iterations where tot >= k)**
