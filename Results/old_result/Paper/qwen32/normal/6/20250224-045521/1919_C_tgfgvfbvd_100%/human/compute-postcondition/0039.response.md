To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable seems to represent the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the given code snippet.
- `n` is the number of elements in the list `l`.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `a` is the smallest element in `l`.
- `b` is the second smallest element in `l` if it exists; otherwise, `float('inf')`.
- `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(c)
```

### Analysis:
The variable `c` represents the count of elements in the list `l` that are greater than the second smallest element `b`. To determine the exact value of `c`, we need to consider the following:

1. **Determine `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is the smallest element in `l`.
   - `b` is the second smallest element in `l` if it exists. If there is no second smallest element (i.e., all elements in `l` are the same), then `b` is set to `float('inf')`.

2. **Count Elements Greater than `b`:**
   - If `b` is `float('inf')`, it implies that all elements in `l` are the same, and `c` will be 0 because no element can be greater than `float('inf')`.
   - If `b` is a finite number, then `c` will be the count of elements in `l` that are strictly greater than `b`.

### Output Description:
Given the initial state, the value of `c` depends on the contents of the list `l`. Since the exact list `l` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `c`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of elements in `l` that are greater than the second smallest element `b`.

### Final Output:
Output: **c (where c is the count of elements in the list l that are greater than the second smallest element b)**
