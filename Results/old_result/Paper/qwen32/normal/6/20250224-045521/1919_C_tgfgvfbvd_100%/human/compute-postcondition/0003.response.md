Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`.**

Natural Language: The values of `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are both set to positive infinity (`float('inf')`).
