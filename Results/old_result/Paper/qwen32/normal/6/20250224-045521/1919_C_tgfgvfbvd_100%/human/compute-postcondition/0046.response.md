Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0; `a` is greater than `b`.**

Note: In this specific case, the condition `a > b` is always false because both `a` and `b` are initialized to `float('inf')`. However, the postcondition is formulated based on the given if condition.
