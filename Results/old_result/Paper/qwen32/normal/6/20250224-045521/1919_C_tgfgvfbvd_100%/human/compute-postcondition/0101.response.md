Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; if `a` > `b`, then `a` is the previous value of `b` and `b` is the previous value of `a`; otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their previous values; `c` is set based on the previous iteration; `x` is incremented by 1.**
