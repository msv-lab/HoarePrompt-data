Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `l[x]`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `a` is updated to be equal to the element at index `x` in the list `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
