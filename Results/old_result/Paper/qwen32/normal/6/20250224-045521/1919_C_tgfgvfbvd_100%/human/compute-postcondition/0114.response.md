Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `l[x]`; if `a > b`, then `a` is the previous value of `b` and `b` is the previous value of `a`; `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x] > b` in the previous iteration; `x` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `c` is incremented by 1.**

In simpler terms: The value of `c` is increased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
