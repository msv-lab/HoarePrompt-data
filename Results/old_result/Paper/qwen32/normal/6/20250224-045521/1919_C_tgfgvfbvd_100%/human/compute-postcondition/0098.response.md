Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains `float('inf')`. Otherwise, `l[x]` is greater than `a`, `a` remains `float('inf')`, and if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is set to 1.**
