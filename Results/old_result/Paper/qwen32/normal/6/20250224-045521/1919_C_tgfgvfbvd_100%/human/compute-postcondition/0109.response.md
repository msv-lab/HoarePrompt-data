The code snippet `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the value that `a` held before the swap will now be held by `b`, and the value that `b` held before the swap will now be held by `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is the previous value of `b`; `b` is the previous value of `a`; `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x] > b` in the previous iteration; `x` is incremented by 1.**
