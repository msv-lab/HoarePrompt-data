The code snippet `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the value of `a` becomes the previous value of `b`, and the value of `b` becomes the previous value of `a`. Other variables such as `t`, `n`, `l`, `c`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is the previous value of `b`; `b` is the previous value of `a`; `c` is set based on the previous iteration; `x` is incremented by 1.**
