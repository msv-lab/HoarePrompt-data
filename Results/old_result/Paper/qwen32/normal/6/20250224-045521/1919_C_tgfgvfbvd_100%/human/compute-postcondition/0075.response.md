Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `l` is the new list of integers obtained from the input; `x` is `x + 1`. If `l[x]` was less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` have swapped values.**
