The code snippet provided appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. No other variables are modified by this code snippet.

Given the initial state, the value of `result` is already defined as the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and `results` already contains one element, which is also this returned value. After the execution of `results.append(result)`, `results` will contain two identical elements, both being the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[9 + 4n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[10 + 4n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `13 + 5n + n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two identical values, each the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.
