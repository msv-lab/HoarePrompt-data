### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the program: the variable `k` is used within the `calculate_score` function but is not passed as a parameter. This would indeed result in a `NameError` because `k` is not defined within the scope of `calculate_score`.

Let's re-examine the program and verify if there are any other issues or if the identified issue is the only one.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha and compares their scores to determine the winner.
   - No issues identified here.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a player starting from a given position.
   - It uses a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the positions visited and the number of steps taken to reach them.
   - It iterates until `k` steps are taken or a cycle is detected.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps by determining how many full cycles can be completed and the remaining steps after full cycles.
   - The logic for handling cycles and remaining steps after cycles is correct and efficient.
   - However, as mentioned, `k` is used but not passed as a parameter, which is a critical error.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads all input data at once and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case and appends the result to a list.
   - It prints all results after processing all test cases.
   - This function is correctly implemented assuming `k` is available.

### Correctness:

The primary issue identified in the original assessment is the undefined global variable `k` within the `calculate_score` function. This issue needs to be addressed by passing `k` as a parameter to `calculate_score`.

Here is the corrected version of the `calculate_score` function:

```python
def calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score
```

### Final Answer:

Given that the primary issue is the undefined global variable `k` within the `calculate_score` function, which is resolved by passing `k` as a parameter, the program can be corrected. However, without this correction, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
