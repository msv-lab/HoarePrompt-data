The code snippet `PS = int(data[index + 3])` updates the value of `PS` to be the integer value of the element at position `index + 3` in the `data` list. Given that `index` is initially 1, `PS` will be updated to the integer value of `data[4]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**
