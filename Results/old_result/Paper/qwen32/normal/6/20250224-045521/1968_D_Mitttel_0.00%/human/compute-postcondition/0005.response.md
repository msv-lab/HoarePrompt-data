The given code snippet initializes an empty list named `results`. None of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `data`, `index`, `t`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and the array, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. `index` is 1. `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`. `results` is an empty list.**
