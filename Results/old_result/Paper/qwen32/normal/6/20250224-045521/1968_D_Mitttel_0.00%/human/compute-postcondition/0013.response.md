Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5]` to `data[5 + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `5 + n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**

The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, making its new value `5 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
