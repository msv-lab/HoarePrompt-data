The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop condition) and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5]` to `data[5 + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + n]` to `data[5 + 2n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `5 + 2n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**
