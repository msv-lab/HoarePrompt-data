Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the `calculate_score` function. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the situation where a player enters a cycle before completing `k` steps. The function incorrectly assumes that the first time a position is revisited, it marks the start of a cycle, but it does not account for the possibility that the player might revisit the same position multiple times before entering a true cycle. This can lead to incorrect cycle detection and score calculation.

Additionally, the `func_1` function does not pass the `k` parameter to the `calculate_score` function, which is necessary for the score calculation to be accurate over the correct number of turns.

Here is a specific case that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3 1 2
3 1 2
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Explanation of the Expected Output:**
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya: Position 1, Score 1, Moves to position 3.
  - Sasha: Position 2, Score 2, Moves to position 1.
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya: Position 3, Score 1 + 3 = 4, Moves to position 2.
  - Sasha: Position 1, Score 2 + 1 = 3, Moves to position 3.
- Turn 3:
  - Bodya: Position 2, Score 4 + 2 = 6, Stays at position 2.
  - Sasha: Position 3, Score 3 + 3 = 6, Stays at position 3.

After 3 turns, both players have a score of 6, so the output should be "Draw".

**Actual Output:**
The program will likely output "Bodya" or "Sasha" incorrectly because the cycle detection and score calculation are flawed.

To fix the program, the `calculate_score` function needs to correctly identify cycles and ensure that the score is calculated accurately over the exact number of turns `k`. Additionally, the `func_1` function needs to pass the `k` parameter to `calculate_score`.
