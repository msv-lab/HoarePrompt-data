The code snippet provided initializes a variable `index` to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `index` while keeping all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and the array, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of turns, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, such that 1 <= PB, PS <= n. `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the permutation, and `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the array. `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input. `index` is 0.**
