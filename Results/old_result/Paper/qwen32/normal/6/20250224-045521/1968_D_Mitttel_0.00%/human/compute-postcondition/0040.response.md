Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[9 + 4n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[10 + 4n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `13 + 5n + n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `result` has been updated to the value returned by the function `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`. The list `results` now contains this returned value twice, as it includes both the previously stored result from `func_1` and the newly computed `result`. All other variables retain their initial values.
