To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the loop's behavior and how it modifies the variables. The loop iterates over a cycle in a permutation `p` and accumulates the scores from the array `a` at the positions determined by the permutation.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

1. **`cycle_length`** indicates how many iterations the loop will execute.
2. **`cycle_score`** accumulates the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p`.
3. **`cycle_pos`** is updated to the next position in the permutation during each iteration.

From the provided output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can see that `cycle_score` is updated by adding the value from `a[cycle_pos - 1]` and `cycle_pos` is updated to `p[cycle_pos - 1]` in each iteration.

After `cycle_length` iterations, the loop terminates, and we need to finalize the `cycle_score` and `cycle_pos`.

Let's assume the following values based on the provided information:
- `cycle_length` is 3 (since we have output states for 1, 2, and 3 iterations).
- `cycle_score` after 3 iterations is the sum of the values from `a` at the positions determined by the permutation `p` for 3 steps.
- `cycle_pos` after 3 iterations is the position in the permutation after 3 steps.

Since the problem states that `cycle_length` is the number of iterations the loop will execute, after `cycle_length` iterations, the loop will have completed its execution.

Let's assume the specific values for `a` and `p` that would lead to the given output states. For simplicity, let's assume:
- `a = [10, 20, 30, 40]`
- `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
- The cycle starts at position 1 and has a length of 4, but we are only interested in the first 3 iterations.

Given these assumptions, let's calculate the final state:

1. **Iteration 1**:
   - `cycle_pos = 2` (initial position in the permutation)
   - `cycle_score += a[1] = 20`
   - `cycle_pos = p[1] = 3`

2. **Iteration 2**:
   - `cycle_pos = 3`
   - `cycle_score += a[2] = 30`
   - `cycle_pos = p[2] = 4`

3. **Iteration 3**:
   - `cycle_pos = 4`
   - `cycle_score += a[3] = 40`
   - `cycle_pos = p[3] = 1`

After 3 iterations, the final state will be:
- `cycle_score = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90`
- `cycle_pos = 1`

The other variables (`score`, `current_pos`, `steps`, `visited`, `cycle_start`) remain unchanged from their pre-loop values.

Output State: **score is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected; current_pos is the final position in the permutation before the loop terminates; steps is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; visited is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; cycle_start is the step at which a cycle begins; cycle_length is 0; cycle_score is 90; cycle_pos is 1.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the cumulative score accumulated from the array `a` at the positions determined by the permutation `p` is 90, and the final position in the permutation before the loop terminates is 1. The cycle length is now 0, indicating the loop has completed all iterations.
