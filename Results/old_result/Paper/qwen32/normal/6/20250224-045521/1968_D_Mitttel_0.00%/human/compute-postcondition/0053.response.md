The code snippet assigns the value of `k - steps` to the variable `remaining_steps`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected; `current_pos` is the final position in the permutation before the loop terminates; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is 0; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`.**
