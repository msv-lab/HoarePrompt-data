The code snippet provided assigns the result of the function call `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` to the variable `result`. This means that the value of `result` will change based on what `func_1` returns. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, `data`, `index`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged unless `func_1` modifies them, which is not indicated in the provided code snippet.

Given that `results` is a list containing `result`, and now `result` has been updated, `results` will also reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + 2n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[7 + 2n]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[8 + 2n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[9 + 2n]` to `data[9 + 3n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `9 + 4n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.
