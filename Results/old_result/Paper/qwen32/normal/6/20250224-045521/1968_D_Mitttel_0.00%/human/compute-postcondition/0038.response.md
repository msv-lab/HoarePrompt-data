The given code snippet updates the list `a` by mapping the elements from `data[index:index + n]` to integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `a` was initially defined as a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, and the new assignment redefines `a` with the same slice of `data` but explicitly converting each element to an integer, the value of `a` does not change in terms of its content. 

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[9 + 4n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[10 + 4n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `13 + 4n + n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and the value of `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.
