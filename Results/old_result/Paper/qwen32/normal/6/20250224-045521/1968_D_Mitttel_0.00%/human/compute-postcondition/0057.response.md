The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `remainder_steps`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `remainder_steps`. If `remainder_steps` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

Given the state before the loop starts, the state of `remainder_steps` determines if the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0.

State: **`score` is the cumulative sum of the scores from the array `a` at positions determined by the permutation `p` up to the point where a cycle is detected plus `full_cycles * cycle_score`; `current_pos` is the final position in the permutation before the loop terminates; `steps` is the step at which the loop terminates due to a cycle; `visited` is a dictionary mapping positions to the steps at which they were visited; `cycle_start` is the step at which a cycle begins; `cycle_length` is `CL`; `cycle_score` is 90; `cycle_pos` is 1; `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`; `full_cycles` is `(k - steps) // CL`; `remainder_steps` is greater than 0**
