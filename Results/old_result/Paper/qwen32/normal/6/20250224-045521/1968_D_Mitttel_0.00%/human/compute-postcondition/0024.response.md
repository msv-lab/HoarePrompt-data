The code snippet provided updates the list `p` by mapping the values from `data` starting at `index` to `index + n` to integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + 2n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[7 + 2n]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[8 + 2n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[9 + 2n]` to `data[9 + 3n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + n]` to `data[5 + 2n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `9 + 2n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**

In natural language: The list `p` is updated to contain `n` integers starting from `data[9 + 2n]` to `data[9 + 3n - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values.
