Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is the integer value of data[1 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)], k is the integer value of data[2 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)], PB is the integer value of data[3 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)], PS is the integer value of data[4 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)], p is a list of n integers from data[5 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)] to data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2) - 1], a is a list of n integers from data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2)] to data[5 + 4(t-1) + 4n(t-2) - 1], data is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, index is 1 + 4t + 2n(t-1), t is 0, results is a list containing t results, each the value returned by func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the integer value of `data[1 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2) - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 4n(t-2) - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `1 + 4t + 2n(t-1)`, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing 1 result, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the integer value of `data[1 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2) - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 4n(t-2) - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `1 + 4t + 2n(t-1)`, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing 1 result, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is the integer value of `data[1 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2) - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 4n(t-2) - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `1 + 4t + 2n(t-1)`, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least 2 results, which includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and another result




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
