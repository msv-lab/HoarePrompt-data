The code snippet updates the value of `PS` by assigning it the integer value of `data[index + 3]`. Given the initial state, `index` is `5 + 2n`, so `PS` is now assigned the value of `data[5 + 2n + 3]`, which is `data[8 + 2n]`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[5 + 2n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + 2n]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[7 + 2n]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[8 + 2n]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5]` to `data[5 + n - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + n]` to `data[5 + 2n - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `5 + 2n`, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing `result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`**.

In natural language, the value of `PS` has been updated to the integer value of `data[8 + 2n]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
