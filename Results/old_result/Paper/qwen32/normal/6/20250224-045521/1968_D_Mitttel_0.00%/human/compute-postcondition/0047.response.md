Given the for loop statement:

```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `result`. This means that the state of `results` is the only one that can be adjusted to determine if the loop can execute one more time.

In the state provided:
- `results` is a list containing 1 result, which is the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
- `t` is 1, indicating that this is the first iteration of the loop (assuming `t` is incremented within the loop body or elsewhere).

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have more than one element. This means that `results` should be a list with at least two elements.

However, based on the provided information, `results` currently has only one element. Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to assume that `results` has been updated to contain at least two elements.

State: **`n` is the integer value of `data[1 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `PB` is the integer value of `data[3 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `PS` is the integer value of `data[4 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 2n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2) - 1]`, `a` is a list of `n` integers from `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 3n(t-2)]` to `data[5 + 4(t-1) + 4n(t-2) - 1]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `1 + 4t + 2n(t-1)`, `t` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least 2 results, which includes the value returned by `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` and another result**.
