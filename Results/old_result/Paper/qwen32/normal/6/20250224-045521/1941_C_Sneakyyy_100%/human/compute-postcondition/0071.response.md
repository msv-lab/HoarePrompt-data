Output State: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())` and must be at least 1; `n` is an integer; `a` is a string with length greater than `i + 2`; `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`; if the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` was 3 (when `s` was 'map' or 'pie'), it becomes 4. If `i` was 1 (when `s` was neither 'map' nor 'pie'), it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
