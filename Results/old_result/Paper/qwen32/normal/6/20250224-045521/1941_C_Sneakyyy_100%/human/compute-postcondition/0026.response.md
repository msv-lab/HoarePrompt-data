To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state provided. However, the initial state description does not mention any variable named `ans`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` based on the given information.

Since the value of `ans` is not explicitly defined or described in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the value of the variable ans)**
