Postcondition: **`iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())` and must be at least 1; `n` is an integer; `a` is a string with length greater than 8; `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`. If the original `s` was 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 3 and `i` is 9. Otherwise, if the original `s` was not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3. If after the change `s` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 7. Otherwise, if the new `s` was not 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5.**
