### Reasoning:

The task requires us to determine the minimum number of deletions needed to make a string beautiful by removing occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". The provided program iterates through each string, checking for these substrings and counting how many non-overlapping occurrences there are. The count then represents the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a` itself.

2. **Counting Substrings**: The program initializes a counter `ans` to 0. It then iterates through the string `a` with a while loop, checking each substring of length 3.
   - If the substring is "map" or "pie", it increments the counter `ans` by 1 and skips the next two characters (i.e., it moves the index `i` by 3 to ensure non-overlapping matches).
   - If the substring is not "map" or "pie", it simply moves to the next character (i.e., it increments the index `i` by 1).

3. **Output**: After processing each string, the program prints the count `ans`, which is the minimum number of deletions required.

### Analysis:

- The program correctly identifies non-overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie" and counts them. Since each occurrence requires at least one deletion, the count `ans` correctly represents the minimum number of deletions needed.
- The program handles the constraints appropriately, iterating through each character of the string at most once per test case, ensuring an efficient solution within the given limits.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
