Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string equal to the input value; `ans` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The value of `n` is still the input integer. The string `a` retains its value as the input string. A new variable `ans` is introduced and is set to 0.
