Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, followed by a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: iterations is the value obtained from int(input()), n is an input integer, a is the value obtained from input(), ans is the total count of 'map' and 'pie' substrings in a, i is the smallest integer such that i >= len(a) - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `iterations` is the value obtained from `int(input())` and must be at least 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string, `ans` is the total count of 'map' or 'pie' substrings found in `a`, `i` is the last index checked, which is `len(a) - 2` or greater, causing the loop to terminate.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
