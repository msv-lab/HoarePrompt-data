You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to avoid the substrings "map" and "pie". The program should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of lowercase Latin letters.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each string `s`:
1. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of deletions needed.
2. It iterates through the string `s` using a while loop.
3. It checks substrings of length 3 at each position `i` to see if they match "map" or "pie".
4. If a match is found (`s[i:i+3] == 'map' or s[i:i+3] == 'pie'`), it increments `ans` by 1 and moves the index `i` forward by 3 positions (essentially skipping the matched substring).
5. If no match is found, it simply moves the index `i` forward by 1 position.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Issues in the Program:
The logic of the program has a flaw. When it encounters a substring "map" or "pie", it increments `ans` and skips the next two characters. However, this approach does not guarantee that the minimum number of deletions is achieved.

Consider the following counterexample:
- Input: `s = "ppiepie"`
- The program will check the first three characters "ppi" (no match), then "pie" (match, increment `ans` to 1, skip to index 3), and then "pie" again (match, increment `ans` to 2, skip to index 6).
- The correct answer should be 1 (removing the first 'p' to get "piepie" and then removing the first 'p' again to get "iepie", and finally removing the 'p' to get "ieie", or removing the second 'i' to get "pppie" and then removing the 'p' to get "ppie", and finally removing the 'p' to get "pie").

The program's approach of skipping three characters after a match does not consider optimal deletions and might lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
