The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual string values, converts each of those string values to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `nums`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet, and `n` is also not affected by this specific code snippet.

Since `nums` is reassigned to a new list of integers obtained from the input, we need to reflect this change in the output state. The new value of `nums` will be the list of integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500, now `t` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
