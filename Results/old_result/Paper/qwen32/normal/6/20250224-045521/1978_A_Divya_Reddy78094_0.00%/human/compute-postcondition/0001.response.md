The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop and does not affect the loop's execution, the only variable we need to consider is `t`.

The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is already described as an input integer representing the number of test cases and is within the range 1 to 500, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute. The state remains as is.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500**
