Output State: **`t` is 0; no more test cases are left to process; the state of `n` and `nums` from the last iteration is not relevant as the loop has terminated.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0 because all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `nums` from the last iteration are not relevant anymore since the loop has terminated.
