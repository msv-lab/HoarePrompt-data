The code sorts the list `nums` in descending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `nums` is now sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and it is within the range 1 to 500, now `t` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 1; `n` is the new input integer; `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
