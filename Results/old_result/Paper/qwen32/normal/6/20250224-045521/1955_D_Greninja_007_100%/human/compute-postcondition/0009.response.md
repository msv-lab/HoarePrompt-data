Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m < n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6; `cb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is the sum of the minimum frequency values of common elements between `ca` and `cb` plus 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains the sum of the minimum frequency values of common elements between `ca` and `cb`. The current value of `ca[a[r]]` is less than `cb[a[r]]`. `sm` is incremented by 1.** 

In simpler terms: The value of `sm` is increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
