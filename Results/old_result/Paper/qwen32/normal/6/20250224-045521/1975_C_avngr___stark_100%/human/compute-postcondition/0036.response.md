The code sorts the `temp` list in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, and the indices of `a` not included in `temp` remain unchanged. The `temp` list is now sorted.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `max` is 0, `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
