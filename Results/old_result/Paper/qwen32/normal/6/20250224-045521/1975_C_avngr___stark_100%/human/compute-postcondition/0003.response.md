The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they were provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500); `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
