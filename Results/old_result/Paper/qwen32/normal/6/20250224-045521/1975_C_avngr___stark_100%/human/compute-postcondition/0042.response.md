The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Since `temp` is described as a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, after sorting, `temp` will still contain the same three elements, but they will be ordered from the smallest to the largest.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `temp` is a sorted list of three integers from the slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `max` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`.**
