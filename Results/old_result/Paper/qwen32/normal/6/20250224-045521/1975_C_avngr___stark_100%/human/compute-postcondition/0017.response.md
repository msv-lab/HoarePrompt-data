The code snippet `temp.sort()` sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. This affects the order of the elements in `temp` but does not change the values of the elements themselves. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, after sorting `temp`, the elements within `temp` will be in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `max`, `i`, and the unsorted portion of `a` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500); `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if the second element of `temp` is greater than the current value of `max`; `temp` is a sorted slice of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`; `i` is incremented by 1; `temp` is now sorted in ascending order.**
