The code snippet assigns the middle element of the sorted list `temp` to the variable `max`. Given that `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]`, `temp[1]` will be the second smallest element in this list, which becomes the value of `max`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]`, `max` is the second smallest element of `temp`.**
