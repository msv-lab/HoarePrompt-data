Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the elements of the array.**
