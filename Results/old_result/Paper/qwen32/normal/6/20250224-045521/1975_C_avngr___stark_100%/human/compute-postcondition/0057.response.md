Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (0 ≤ t ≤ 499), `n` is the integer value from the input, `a` is the new list of integers obtained from the new input, `max` is the maximum value of the second smallest element in any triplet of consecutive elements in `a`, and `_` is `x + 1` where `x` is the value of `_` at the end of the previous iteration. If `n` is equal to 2, the loop continues to the next iteration without modifying `t`, `a`, `max`, or `_`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition since there is no else part.**
