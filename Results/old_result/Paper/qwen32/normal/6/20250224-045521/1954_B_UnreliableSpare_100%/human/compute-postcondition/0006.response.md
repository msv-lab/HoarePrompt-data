Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is False; at the current index `i`, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
