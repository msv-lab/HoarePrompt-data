### Reasoning:

The program is intended to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. If it is impossible to make the array stop being beautiful by removing elements, the program should output `-1`.

Let's break down the program logic:

1. **Initial Check (`flag` variable):**
   - The program initializes a `flag` variable to `True`.
   - It then iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same.
   - If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `flag` remains `True` after the loop, it means all elements in the array are the same, and the program outputs `-1` because an array with all identical elements is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

2. **Finding Minimum Sequence Length (`ans` variable):**
   - If `flag` is `False`, the program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and sets `val` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to `0`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting sequences of identical elements.
   - When it encounters an element different from `val`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt` (the length of the last sequence of identical elements) and resets `cnt` to `0`.
   - After the loop, it performs a final update to `ans` to account for the last sequence of identical elements.
   - The program then outputs the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements in the array.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Case 1: All Elements are the Same**
  - The program correctly identifies this scenario by setting `flag` to `True` and outputs `-1`.

- **Case 2: Not All Elements are the Same**
  - The program correctly identifies sequences of identical elements and calculates the minimum length of such sequences.
  - The minimum length of any sequence of identical elements is indeed the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property of the array.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles both cases: when the array is already beautiful (all elements are the same) and when it contains different elements, correctly calculating the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Correctness:
**True**
