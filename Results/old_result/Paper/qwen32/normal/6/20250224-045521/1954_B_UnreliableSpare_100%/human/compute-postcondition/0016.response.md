To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it affects the variables. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, checking if `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i-1]`. If at any point `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i-1]`, the `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `flag` remains `True`.

Given the initial state and the states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, so if `n` is the length of the list `arr`, the loop will execute `n-1` times.
- The `flag` variable determines whether all elements in `arr` are the same. If any two consecutive elements are different, `flag` becomes `False` and the loop terminates early. If all elements are the same, `flag` remains `True` after the loop completes.

After all iterations, the output state will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `arr`.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is a copy of `arr` and is not modified in the loop.
- `arr` remains unchanged as its elements are not modified in the loop.
- `flag` will be `True` if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise `False`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False.**

In natural language: The final output state is that `t`, `n`, `a`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial values. The `flag` variable will be `True` if all elements in the list `arr` are identical, and `False` if there are any two consecutive elements in `arr` that are different.
