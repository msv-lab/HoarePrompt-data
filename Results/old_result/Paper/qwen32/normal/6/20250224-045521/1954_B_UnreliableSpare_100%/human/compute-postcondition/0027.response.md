Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')` if `arr[i] == val`, otherwise `ans` is 0; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 2 if `arr[i] == val`, otherwise `cnt` is 1; `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, then `cnt` is 2 and `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0.**

Natural Language: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, then `cnt` is now 2 and `ans` remains `Decimal('Infinity')`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` remains 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
