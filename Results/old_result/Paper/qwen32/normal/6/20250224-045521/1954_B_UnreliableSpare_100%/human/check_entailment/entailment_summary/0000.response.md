Reasoning:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Identify if the array is already uniform**: The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it immediately returns `-1` because removing any number of elements from an array with all identical elements will still result in a beautiful array.

2. **Find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements**: If the array is not uniform, the program then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any sequence of identical consecutive elements. This is done by counting the length of each sequence of identical elements and keeping track of the minimum length found.

3. **Output the result**: The program prints the minimum length of consecutive identical elements if the array is not uniform, as this represents the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beautiful property of the array.

The execution summary aligns with the above logic and correctly describes the behavior of the program. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
