The code snippet provided sets the variable `cnt` to 0. This change affects the value of `cnt` directly, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `ans` is 0 if `arr[1] != val`, otherwise `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')`; `val` is `arr[0]`; `cnt` is 0; `i` is 1.**
