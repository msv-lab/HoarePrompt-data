### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Recap:
- **Beautiful Array**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) (where \(2 \le i \le |a| - 1\)) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
- **Task**: Determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it not beautiful. If it is impossible, return `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Checking if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it returns `-1`.
2. If not, it finds the minimum length of contiguous segments of the same value and returns this length as the answer.

### Issues in the Program:
The core issue with the program is its approach to calculating the minimum number of elements to remove. The program assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the smallest contiguous segment of the same value. This is incorrect because:
- **Smallest Segment**: The smallest segment might not be sufficient to break the beautiful property. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the smallest segment is the single `5`, but removing just this one element does not make the array not beautiful.
- **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider how removing elements affects the ability to make all elements the same using the given operation. This involves more complex logic, such as identifying segments and calculating the minimum number of removals required to break the beautiful property.

### Example Case:
Let's consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`:
- The smallest segment is `5`, but removing this single element does not make the array not beautiful.
- To break the beautiful property, we need to remove at least `3` elements (the `3`s surrounding the `5`).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. The logic for calculating the minimum number of removals is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.
