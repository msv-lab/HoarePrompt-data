### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Subarrays**: The program attempts to determine the minimum number of elements to remove by finding the smallest contiguous subarray of identical elements. However, this does not necessarily lead to the correct solution because it does not consider the overall structure of the array and the operations allowed to make it non-beautiful.

2. **Handling of Uniform Arrays**: The program correctly identifies if the entire array is uniform and outputs `-1` in this case.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**: The logic for non-uniform arrays is flawed. The program does not consider the longest sequence of elements that can be made uniform by the allowed operations and then calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break this sequence.

### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
- The program will identify the minimum length of contiguous subarrays as `1` (for the element `5`), leading to an incorrect output of `1`.
- The correct approach is to recognize that the longest sequence of elements that can be made uniform is the sequence of `3`s. To make the array non-beautiful, we need to remove the first three `3`s, resulting in the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the longest contiguous subarray of identical elements.
2. Calculate the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break this sequence and make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified issues and the example analysis, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
