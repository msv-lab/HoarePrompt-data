### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not solve the problem accurately. The program's approach of finding the minimum length of contiguous segments of the same value and using it as the number of elements to remove is flawed. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) (where \(2 \le i \le |a| - 1\)) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. If the array is already uniform (all elements the same), it should return `-1`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Reading Input:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
   - **Checking if the Array is Uniform:** The program correctly identifies if all elements in the array are the same using the `flag` variable. If all elements are the same, it outputs `-1`.
   - **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:** The program attempts to find the minimum length of contiguous segments of the same value and uses this as the number of elements to remove. However, this is incorrect because:
     - The smallest segment length does not necessarily determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.
     - The correct approach involves finding the minimum number of elements that, when removed, disrupt the beautiful property. This often requires more complex logic, such as considering multiple segments and their interactions.

3. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`:
     - The smallest segment length is `1` (the `5`), but removing just one element (the `5`) does not make the array not beautiful.
     - To make the array not beautiful, we need to remove at least `3` elements (the `3`s surrounding the `5`), which is the correct answer.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It does not correctly account for the interactions between segments and the requirement to disrupt the beautiful property.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
