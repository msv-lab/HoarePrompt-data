### Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The program does so by first checking if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because an array with all identical elements is always beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.

If the array is not composed of all identical elements, the program then finds the minimum length of any sequence of identical consecutive elements. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the length of sequences of identical elements. The minimum length of such sequences is stored in the variable `ans`.

The logic to determine if the array is beautiful and to find the minimum sequence length seems correct based on the provided description. However, there is an issue with the implementation that affects the correctness of the program.

The issue arises in the following part of the code:
```python
ans = Decimal('Infinity')
val, cnt = arr[0], 0
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] == val:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 1  # This should be reset to 1, not 0, because the current element starts a new sequence
```
When transitioning from one sequence of identical elements to another, the count for the new sequence should start at 1 (since the current element is the first element of the new sequence), not 0. The current code incorrectly resets `cnt` to 0, which can lead to incorrect results when the minimum length of a sequence is 1.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect due to the issue described above. The count for a new sequence of identical elements should be initialized to 1, not 0.
