The provided code snippet only initializes a boolean variable `flag` to `True`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True.**
