The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer value from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. After executing the code, the value of `n` will be whatever integer is input, but it will still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
