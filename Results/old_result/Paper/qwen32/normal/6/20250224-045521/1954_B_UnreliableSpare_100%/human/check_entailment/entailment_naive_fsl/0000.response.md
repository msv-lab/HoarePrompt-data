Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array stop being beautiful. Let's analyze the code and identify the issues.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Subarrays**:
   - The code attempts to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray where all elements are the same and uses this to determine the minimum number of removals. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to make the array stop being beautiful.

2. **Handling of Uniform Arrays**:
   - The code correctly identifies if the entire array is uniform (all elements are the same) and outputs `-1` in this case. However, the logic for non-uniform arrays is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**:
   - The code calculates the length of contiguous subarrays of identical elements and finds the minimum length. However, this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of removals required to make the array stop being beautiful. For example, in the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the code might incorrectly identify the minimum length of contiguous subarrays as `1` (for the element `5`), but the correct answer is `3` (removing the first three `3`s).

### Example of Incorrect Output:
Consider the input:
```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
- The correct output should be `3` (remove the first three `3`s), but the program might output `1` (incorrectly identifying the minimum length of contiguous subarrays as `1`).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be made uniform by the given operation and then calculate the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break this sequence.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
