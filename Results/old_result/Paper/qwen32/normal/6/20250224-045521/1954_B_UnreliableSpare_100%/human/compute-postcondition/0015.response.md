Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`. If `arr[5]` is not equal to `arr[4]`, `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `flag` remains True and `i` is 5.**
