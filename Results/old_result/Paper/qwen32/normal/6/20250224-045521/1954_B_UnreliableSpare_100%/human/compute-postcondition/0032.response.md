The given code snippet increments the variable `cnt` by 1. Based on the initial state, `cnt` can be either 2 or 0. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, `cnt` starts at 2; otherwise, it starts at 0. Incrementing `cnt` by 1 will result in `cnt` being either 3 or 1, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ n and `arr` is equivalent to `a`; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `val` is `arr[0]`; `i` is 2; `cnt` is either 3 or 1; `ans` is `Decimal('Infinity')` if `arr[i]` equals `val` otherwise `ans` is 0.**
