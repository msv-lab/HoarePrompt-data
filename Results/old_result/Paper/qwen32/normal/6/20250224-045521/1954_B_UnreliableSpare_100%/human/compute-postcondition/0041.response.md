Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
3. `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\).
4. `arr` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq arr_i \leq n\) and `arr` is equivalent to `a`.
5. `flag` is `False` because not all elements in `arr` are the same.
6. `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
7. `val` is `arr[0]`.
8. `cnt` is the length of the last sequence of identical elements.
9. `i` is `n-1`.

### Key Points:
- `arr` is a copy of `a`, so they contain the same elements.
- `flag` is `False`, indicating that `arr` contains at least two different elements.
- `ans` is supposed to hold the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements in `arr`.
- `val` is initialized to the first element of `arr`.
- `cnt` is initialized to the length of the last sequence of identical elements. Since we don't know the exact sequence, we can assume it starts with the first element, so `cnt` could be 1 initially or more if the first few elements are the same.
- `i` is initialized to `n-1`, which is the last index of `arr`.

### Determining `ans`:
- The value of `ans` is not explicitly given, but it is described as the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
- Since `ans` is not provided before the first comparison, we can assume that `ans` is initialized to a large value (possibly `n` or infinity) before the loop or comparison starts.
- During the execution, `ans` would be updated to the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements found in `arr`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Explanation:
- The print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements in the list `arr`.

### Final Output:
Given the information, the most precise description we can provide is that `ans` holds the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements in the list `arr`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum length of any sequence of identical elements in the list `arr`)**
