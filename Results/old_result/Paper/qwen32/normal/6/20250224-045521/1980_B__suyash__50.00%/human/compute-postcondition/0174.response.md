Let's analyze the provided initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`i`**: Set to 2.
2. **`k`**: Calculated as `b[2] - dic[l[0]] - dic[l[1]] - dic[l[2]]`.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting an input string `a`.
   - `dic` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `o` (which is a list of strings obtained by splitting user input and sorted in reverse order) and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in `o`.
   - `l` is a sorted list of unique elements from `o` in reverse order and must have at least 2 elements.
3. **`t`**: Greater than the length of `l` + 1.
4. **`a`**: An input string.
5. **`b`**: A list of integers obtained by splitting and converting `a`.
6. **`o`**: A list of strings obtained by splitting the user's input and sorted in reverse order.
7. **`n`**: Set to `b[0]`.
8. **`f`**: Set to `b[1]`.
9. **`fav`**: Set to `o[f - 1]`.

### The Print Statement:
```python
print('MAYBE')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement is straightforward and does not reference any of the variables or objects defined in the initial state.
- The string `'MAYBE'` is explicitly provided in the print statement.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the string `'MAYBE'` regardless of the values of the variables `i`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, and `fav`.

### Final Output:
Output: **MAYBE**
