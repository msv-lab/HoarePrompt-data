The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop provided in the context, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `a`, `o` is a list of substrings from the new input line, `n` is the first element of `b`, `f` is the second element of `b`, `k` is the third element of `b`, and `k` equals `n`.**
