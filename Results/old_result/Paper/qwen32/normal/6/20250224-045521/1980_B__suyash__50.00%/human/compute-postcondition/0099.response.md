The given Python code snippet contains only a `print('NO')` statement. This statement will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of the variables `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `fav`, `dic`, and `l` described in the initial state. The values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print('NO')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions.
2. The variables `i`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `fav`, `dic`, and `l` are described in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.
3. Since the `print` statement is not influenced by any of these variables, the output will always be `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
