The given `print` statement in the Python code snippet is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about several variables (`i`, `k`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`, `dic`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` function.

Thus, the output of the code is:

Output: **NO**
