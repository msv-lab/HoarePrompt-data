Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state to determine the output state.

Initial State:
- `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration and needs to be 2 for the next iteration.
- `k` is a variable that will be decremented.
- `dic` is a dictionary.
- `l` is a list.
- All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`) remain unchanged.

Code snippet:
```python
k -= dic[l[i]]
```

Since `i` is 2 for the next iteration, the code will execute:
```python
k -= dic[l[2]]
```

This means `k` will be decremented by the value of `dic[l[2]]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by `dic[l[2]]`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `fav`, `dic`, `l` remain unchanged.**

In natural language: The value of `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[2]]`. The variable `i` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
