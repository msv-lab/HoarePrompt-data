To determine the output state, we need to understand the function `func_1` and how it interacts with the variables `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. However, since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only assume that `func_1` processes the `operations` and `queries` lists and returns a `result`.

Given the code snippet:
```
result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
```
We know that `result` will be assigned the value returned by `func_1`.

The initial state of the variables is:
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `q` is the second input integer.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer.
- `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

After executing the code, the only change is that `result` will hold the value returned by `func_1`. The other variables (`n`, `q`, `operations`, `queries`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer, `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
