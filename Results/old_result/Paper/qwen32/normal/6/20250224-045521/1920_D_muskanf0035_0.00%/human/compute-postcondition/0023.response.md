To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand that the loop iterates over each element in the `queries` list. For each `k` in `queries`, it appends `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` to the `result` list. This process continues until all elements in `queries` have been processed.

Given that the loop has already executed for the first 3 iterations, we know that `queries` must have at least 3 elements. The loop will continue to execute for each remaining element in `queries` until `queries` is exhausted.

After all iterations, the `result` list will contain as many elements as there are in the `queries` list, where each element is determined by the corresponding `k` in `queries` using the formula `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]`.

Thus, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`array` is the final list after all operations have been applied, `n` remains the same, `operations` is empty, `queries` is empty, and `result` is a list containing elements `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.**

In simpler terms, the `result` list will have the same number of elements as `queries`, with each element in `result` corresponding to the element in `array` indexed by `(k - 1) % len(array)`, where `k` is each element from `queries`. The `queries` list will be empty because all elements have been processed, and all other variables remain unchanged.
