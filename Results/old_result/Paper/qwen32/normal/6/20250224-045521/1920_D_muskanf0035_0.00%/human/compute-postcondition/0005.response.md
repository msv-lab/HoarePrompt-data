To determine the Output State, we need to understand what the function `func_1` does. However, since the function `func_1` is not provided, we will assume that the function performs some operations based on the inputs `n`, `operations`, and `queries` and returns a result.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first input integer.
- `q` is the second input integer.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer.
- `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `t` must be greater than 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
```

Since we don't have the definition of `func_1`, we can only infer that `func_1` takes `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments and returns a `result`. The values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged by this function call.

Therefore, the Output State will be:
Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer, `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
