Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the operations as described in the problem statement, specifically the second type of operation.

Let's analyze the second type of operation: "Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a. In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}]". The current implementation of the program only appends the array to itself once, regardless of the value of x.

Here is a specific case to demonstrate the issue:
- Suppose the initial array is `[1, 2]`.
- If the operation is `2 3`, the array should become `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` (appending the array 3 times).
- However, the current implementation will only append the array once, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2]`.

This discrepancy means the program does not correctly handle the second type of operation when x > 1, and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
