### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the annotated version and the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis

1. **Initial State**: We start with an empty array `a`.
2. **Operations**:
    - **Type 1**: Append an integer `x` to the end of `a`.
    - **Type 2**: Append `x` copies of the current array `a` to the end of `a`. This can lead to exponential growth in the size of the array.
3. **Queries**: For each query, we need to return the `k`-th element of the final array `a`.

#### Key Points

- **Operation Type 2**: When performing an operation of type 2, the array can grow exponentially. Storing the entire array in memory might be infeasible for large `x`.
- **Queries**: The queries require finding the `k`-th element of the final array, which might be extremely large.

#### Program Analysis

The provided solution is as follows:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

#### Annotations

1. **State before `func_1`**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations.
   - `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `op_type` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `value`.
   - `queries` is a list of integers representing the positions to query in the array.

2. **State after operations in `func_1`**:
   - `array` is the final list after all operations have been applied.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `operations` is empty.
   - `queries` remains the same.
   - `result` remains an empty list.

3. **State after queries in `func_1`**:
   - `array` is the final list after all operations have been applied.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `operations` is empty.
   - `queries` is empty.
   - `result` is a list containing elements `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.

#### Issues with the Solution

1. **Exponential Growth**:
   - The solution uses `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` to handle operation type 2. This approach is inefficient for large `x` because it creates a new list that is `x` times the size of the current array and extends the original array with this new list. This will lead to excessive memory usage and slow execution time for large `x`.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - The solution calculates the `k`-th element by using modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This approach is correct in terms of logic but only works if the entire array is stored in memory, which is not feasible due to the exponential growth of the array.

#### Correctness

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution is not correct because it does not handle the exponential growth of the array efficiently. It will run out of memory or take too long to execute for large `x`.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to its inefficient handling of the exponential growth of the array during operation type 2 and the fact that it attempts to store the entire array in memory, which is not feasible for large inputs.

**Final: False**
