The given code snippet updates the `queries` variable by reading a line of input, splitting it into individual components, and converting each component into an integer. This means that `queries` will now hold a list of integers derived from the user input.

The other variables (`n`, `q`, `operations`, `t`, and `result`) are not directly affected by this code snippet and retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer, `queries` is a list of integers derived from the input, `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`**.
