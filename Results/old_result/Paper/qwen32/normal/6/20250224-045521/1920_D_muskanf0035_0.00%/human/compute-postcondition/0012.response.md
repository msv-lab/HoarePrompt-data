To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, we need to break down the information provided in the initial state and understand the components involved:

1. **Variables and Inputs**:
   - `n`: The first input integer.
   - `q`: The second input integer.
   - `operations`: A list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains two integers `(b, x)` with `b` being either 1 or 2 and `x` being a positive integer.
   - `queries`: A list of integers derived from the input.
   - `t`: This variable is mentioned but not defined or used in the provided code snippet. It seems to be a decrementing counter, but its exact role and value are not clear from the given information.
   - `result`: The value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three arguments: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
   - The output of this function, `result`, is what will be printed.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(*result)`: The asterisk `*` before `result` indicates that the elements of `result` will be unpacked and printed as separate arguments.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical values of `result`. However, we can describe the output based on the information given.

### Explanation:
- `result` is the output of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.
- The exact nature of `result` depends on how `func_1` processes the inputs `n`, `operations`, and `queries`.
- The `*` operator in the `print(*result)` statement means that if `result` is a list or any iterable, its elements will be printed separated by spaces.

### Output Description:
The output will be the unpacked elements of the list (or iterable) `result`, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)` and will be unpacked and printed as separate arguments)**
