Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has an issue with how it handles the second type of operation (appending x copies of array a to the end of array a). The current implementation of the program incorrectly duplicates the array by extending it with itself, but it does not account for the number of copies specified by x. Instead of extending the array by itself x times, it only appends the array once.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to extend the array by itself x times when the second type of operation is performed. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * (value - 1))  # Extend the array by itself (value - 1) times
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

This change ensures that the array is correctly duplicated x times when the second type of operation is performed.
