The code provided is responsible for reading `n` operations from the input, where each operation is a list of two integers. This means that after the code executes, the `operations` list will be populated with `n` sublists, each containing two integers.

Output State: **`n` is the first input integer, `q` is the second input integer, `operations` is a list of `n` lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with b being either 1 or 2 and x being a positive integer, `queries` is a list of positive integers representing the queries; `t` must be greater than 0.**

In natural language: After execution, `operations` will contain `n` sublists, each with two integers, while `n`, `q`, `queries`, and `t` retain their initial values.
