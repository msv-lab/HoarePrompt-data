You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer op_type (either 1 or 2) and an integer value, and queries is a list of integers representing the positions to query in the array.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):

    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)

    #State: `array` is the final list after all operations have been applied, `n` remains the same, `operations` is empty, `queries` remains the same, and `result` remains an empty list.

    return result
    #The program returns `result`, which is a list containing elements `array[(k - 1) % len(array)]` for each `k` in the original `queries` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, a non-negative integer representing the number of operations; `operations`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `op_type` (either 1 or 2) and an integer `value`; and `queries`, a list of integers representing the positions to query in the array. The function performs a series of operations on an array based on the `operations` list and then returns a list of elements from the array based on the positions specified in `queries`. Each element in the result list corresponds to the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in the `queries` list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of lists where each sublist contains two integers (b, x) with b being either 1 or 2 and x being a positive integer, and queries is a list of positive integers representing the queries.

    #State: `t` is 0, `n`, `q`, `operations`, `queries`, and `result` are the values from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of operations and queries. For each test case, it processes a series of operations and then answers a set of queries based on the results of those operations. The function outputs the answers to the queries for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Initial State**: We start with an empty array `a`.
2. **Operations**:
    - **Type 1**: Append an integer `x` to the end of `a`.
    - **Type 2**: Append `x` copies of the current array `a` to the end of `a`. This means the size of the array will increase significantly.
3. **Queries**: For each query, we need to return the `k`-th element of the final array `a`.

### Key Points

- **Operation Type 2**: When performing an operation of type 2, the array can grow exponentially. This means that storing the entire array in memory might be infeasible for large `x`.
- **Queries**: The queries require finding the `k`-th element of the final array, which might be extremely large.

### Solution Analysis

Let's look at the provided solution:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

#### Issues with the Solution

1. **Exponential Growth**: The solution uses `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` to handle operation type 2. This approach is inefficient for large `x` because it creates a new list that is `x` times the size of the current array and extends the original array with this new list. This will lead to excessive memory usage and slow execution time for large `x`.

2. **Query Handling**: The solution calculates the `k`-th element by using modulo operation `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This approach is correct in terms of logic but only works if the entire array is stored in memory, which is not feasible due to the exponential growth of the array.

### Correctness

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution is not correct because it does not handle the exponential growth of the array efficiently. It will run out of memory or take too long to execute for large `x`.

#### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to its inefficient handling of the exponential growth of the array during operation type 2 and the fact that it attempts to store the entire array in memory, which is not feasible for large inputs.
