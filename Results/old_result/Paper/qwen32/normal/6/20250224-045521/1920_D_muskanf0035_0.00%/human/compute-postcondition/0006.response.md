To determine what will be printed by the `print(*result)` statement, we need to break down the given initial state and understand the variables and their relationships.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: This is the first input integer, which indicates the number of operations.
2. **`q`**: This is the second input integer, which indicates the number of queries.
3. **`operations`**: This is a list of `n` lists, where each sublist contains two integers `(b, x)`. Here, `b` is either 1 or 2, and `x` is a positive integer.
4. **`queries`**: This is a list of integers derived from the input. The exact derivation is not specified, but it is a list of `q` integers.
5. **`t`**: It is mentioned that `t` must be greater than 0, but `t` is not used in the given code snippet.
6. **`result`**: This is the value returned by the function `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. The exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, but we can infer that it takes `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments and returns some value (or values) stored in `result`.

### The Print Statement:
The `print(*result)` statement will unpack the `result` if it is a list or any iterable and print each element separated by a space. If `result` is a single value (not an iterable), it will print that single value.

### Determining the Output:
Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values that `result` will hold. However, we can describe the output based on the information given:

- **`result`**: This variable holds the return value of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`. The nature of `result` (whether it's a single value or a list of values) depends on how `func_1` is implemented.

### Final Output Description:
Given that `result` is the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)`, the printed output will be the value(s) returned by `func_1`.

Output: **result (where result is the value returned by `func_1(n, operations, queries)`)**
