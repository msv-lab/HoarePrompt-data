### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program's correctness based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Operation 1**: Append an integer `x` to the end of array `a`.
2. **Operation 2**: Append `x` copies of array `a` to the end of array `a`.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program has two functions:
- `func_1(n, operations, queries)`: This function processes the operations and queries.
- `func_2()`: This function reads input, calls `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Key Issue:
The main issue highlighted in the original assessment is the handling of the second type of operation. Specifically, the program only appends the array to itself once when `op_type == 2`, regardless of the value of `x`.

#### Detailed Examination:
1. **Operation Handling**:
   - **Operation 1**: Correctly appends the integer `x` to the end of `array`.
   - **Operation 2**: Incorrectly appends the array to itself only once. The line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is equivalent to `array.extend(array)`, which appends the current array to itself exactly once, not `x` times.

2. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the operations and queries are processed.
   - However, the annotations do not address the core issue with the incorrect handling of the second type of operation.

#### Example:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:
- Initial array: `[]`
- Operations: `[(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3)]`
- Expected final array: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
- Actual final array with the current implementation: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`

The discrepancy is clear: the array should be extended `x` times, not just once.

#### Correct Implementation:
To fix the issue, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` should be replaced with a loop that appends the array `x` times. Here's a corrected version of the relevant part of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * value)  # Append the array `value` times
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the second type of operation when `x > 1`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
