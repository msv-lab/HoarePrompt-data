Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires simulating a game where two players, Bodya and Sasha, move through a permutation array `p` and collect scores based on the values in an array `a`. The players can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by `p`. The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score at the end wins.

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` as described.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The code converts the 1-based indices in `p` and `a` to 0-based indices by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Score Calculation Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It uses a `vis` (visited) array to track visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The function iterates while the current position has not been visited and `k` turns are left.
   - For each turn, it adds the current position's score to the current score `cur` and updates the maximum score `mx` considering the remaining turns.
   - The player moves to the position indicated by `p[s]`.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The code calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`.
   - It compares the scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Potential Issues
- **Index Adjustment:** The code subtracts 1 from each element in `a` and `p`, which is incorrect. The values in `a` should not be adjusted because they represent scores, not indices.
- **Infinite Loops:** The code correctly uses the `vis` array to prevent infinite loops, but it should handle the case where the player is in a loop without collecting any score.
- **Score Calculation:** The calculation of `mx` is correct in the sense that it considers the maximum score possible by staying or moving, but the initial subtraction of 1 from `a` will lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness
Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect adjustment of the scores in `a`, the program is not correct.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **False**

The program should not subtract 1 from the elements of `a`. The rest of the logic seems to be correct for the problem as described.
