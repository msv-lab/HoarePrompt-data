### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the "Permutation game" problem as described. The program processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a permutation `p`, an array `a`, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the permutation), `k` (number of turns), `P_B` (Bodya's starting position), and `P_S` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based for easier manipulation in Python (subtracting 1 from each element).

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program uses the function `func_1` to calculate the maximum possible score for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - `func_1` iterates through the permutation starting from the given position `s` (either `pb-1` for Bodya or `ps-1` for Sasha).
   - It keeps track of the current score `cur` and the remaining turns `k`.
   - It also keeps track of visited positions to detect cycles.
   - For each position `s` visited, it updates the maximum score `mx` considering the remaining turns `k`.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The function `func_1` stops iterating when a cycle is detected (i.e., a position is visited more than once) or when all turns `k` are used up.
   - The maximum score `mx` is returned, which represents the best possible score for the player starting from position `s`.

5. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha, the program compares them.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, or "Draw" if their scores are equal.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum score for each player by following the rules of the game. It handles cycles in the permutation correctly and efficiently computes the scores using a greedy approach, considering the remaining turns.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
