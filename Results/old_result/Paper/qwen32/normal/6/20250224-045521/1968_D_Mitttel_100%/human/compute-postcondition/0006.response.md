The value of `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`. The values of `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `cur`, and `vis` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, `n` is the length of the list `p`, `mx` is max(0, cur + k * a[0]), `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of n zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1.**
