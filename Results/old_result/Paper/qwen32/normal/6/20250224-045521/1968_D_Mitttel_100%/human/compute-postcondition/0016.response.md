Let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the program state to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

The `while` loop statement is:
```
while not vis[s] and k > 0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop condition, we know that the loop will continue if `vis[s]` is `False` and `k` is greater than 0. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\).
- `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
- `s` is `p[s]`.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\) and `k` is now `k - 1`.
- `n` is the length of the list `p`.
- `mx` is `max(max(0, a[0] + k * a[0]), a[0] + k * a[s])`.
- `cur` is `a[0] + a[s]`.
- `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 1.

The key variables in the loop condition are `vis[s]` and `k`.

- `vis[s]` is currently set to `1` (True), which means the loop will not execute if it remains `1`. To make the loop execute, `vis[s]` must be `0` (False).
- `k` is currently `k - 1`, and we need to ensure that `k` is still greater than `0` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `vis[s]` is `0` and `k` is greater than `0`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\); `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`; `s` is `p[s]`; `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9 - 1\) and `k` is now `k - 1` but must be greater than 0; `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is `max(max(0, a[0] + k * a[0]), a[0] + k * a[s])`; `cur` is `a[0] + a[s]`; `vis` is a list of `n` zeros with `vis[0]` set to 1 and `vis[s]` set to 0**.
