### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment using the problem description, the code, and the function summary.

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at different positions in a permutation array `p` and collect scores based on an array `a`.
   - Each player can either stay or move to the position indicated by `p` on each turn.
   - The game lasts for `k` turns, and the player with the higher score at the end wins.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` for each test case.
   - The code adjusts the indices of `p` by subtracting 1, which is correct because Python uses 0-based indexing.
   - The code incorrectly adjusts the values in `a` by subtracting 1, which is incorrect because the values in `a` represent scores and should not be adjusted.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It uses a `vis` array to track visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The function iterates while the current position has not been visited and `k` turns are left.
   - For each turn, it adds the current position's score to the current score `cur` and updates the maximum score `mx` considering the remaining turns.
   - The player moves to the position indicated by `p[s]`.

4. **Game Simulation**:
   - The code calculates the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha using `func_1`.
   - It compares the scores and prints "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison.

### Issues Identified:
- The main issue is the incorrect adjustment of the values in `a`. The code subtracts 1 from each element in `a`, which is incorrect because the values in `a` represent scores and should not be adjusted.
- The logic for calculating the maximum score using `func_1` seems correct once the issue with `a` is resolved.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issue with the incorrect adjustment of the scores in `a`, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program should not subtract 1 from the elements of `a`. The rest of the logic seems to be correct for the problem as described.
