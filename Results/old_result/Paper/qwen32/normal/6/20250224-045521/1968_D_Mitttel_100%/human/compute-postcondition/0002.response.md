Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `p` is a list of n integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a tuple of two integers (P_B, P_S) where 1 <= P_B, P_S <= n, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9, and `n` is the length of the list `p`; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `cur` has been initialized to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as specified.
