You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Recap
The problem requires us to construct an array of integers with at most 200 elements such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If it's not possible, we should output `-1`.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X` which represents the number of increasing subsequences required.

2. **Adjusting `X`:**
   - The program starts by subtracting 1 from `X`. This is because the empty subsequence is always counted, so we need `X - 1` non-empty increasing subsequences.

3. **Finding Subsequence Lengths:**
   - The program uses a while loop to find the lengths of increasing subsequences that contribute to the total count `X`.
   - It calculates the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `X + 1` and appends the exponent to the list `subseq_lens`.
   - It then subtracts `2^i - 1` from `X` and updates the maximum length `mx` found so far.

4. **Constructing the Array:**
   - The program initializes the array `ansv` with values from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - It then appends the remaining lengths in `subseq_lens` to `ansv`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

### Issues in the Program
1. **Handling of `X`:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case when `X` is a power of 2. For example, if `X` is 2, the program should output an array with 1 element, but it outputs an array with 2 elements.
   - The logic for breaking down `X` into sums of `(2^i - 1)` is not optimal and may not always produce the correct array.

2. **Generating the Array:**
   - The logic to generate the array `ansv` from the `subseq_lens` is flawed. The array should be constructed in such a way that it produces exactly `X` increasing subsequences, which the current implementation does not guarantee.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as very large values of `X` or specific values that require a specific array structure.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the program, it does not correctly solve the problem for all possible values of `X`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
