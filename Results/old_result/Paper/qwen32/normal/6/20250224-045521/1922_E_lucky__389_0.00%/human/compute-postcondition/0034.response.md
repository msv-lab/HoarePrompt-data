The provided code snippet `mx = max(mx, i)` updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum value between its current value and the value of `i`. The initial state does not specify the value of `mx` or `i`, so we will consider the impact based on these variables.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
- `x` is an integer such that `x` is reduced by `2`.

The code snippet only impacts `mx` and `i`. Since the initial state does not provide the values for `mx` and `i`, we can only describe the updated state in terms of these variables.

After executing the code:
- `mx` will be the maximum of its previous value and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, `x` is an integer reduced by 2, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
