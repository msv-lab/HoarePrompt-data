The code snippet `x = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= X <= 10^18. However, the code snippet only pertains to reading one value of `x`, which will replace the previous value of `x` if it existed.

Since the code only reads one value and assigns it to `x`, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the precondition for `t` still holds. The initial condition for `X` (2 <= X <= 10^18) does not affect this specific line of code, but it implies that the value of `x` after this line will be within this range if the input adheres to the precondition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 10^18.**
