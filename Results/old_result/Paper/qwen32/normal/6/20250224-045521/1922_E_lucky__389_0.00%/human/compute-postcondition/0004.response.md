The only variable in the loop head is `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is not equal to 0. Given that the state right before the loop is `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^18 - 1, `x` is already guaranteed to be not equal to 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^18 - 1; `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0**
