### Reasoning

Let's analyze the problem description and the program code in detail.

#### Problem Analysis:
The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns, where each turn consists of two steps:
1. Choosing to swap wallets or not.
2. Removing one coin from the current wallet.

The key point is that the player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., the player whose wallet has 0 coins) loses. The problem states that both players play optimally. 

#### Game Theory Insight:
The critical insight is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).

- If `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
- If `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.

This is because:
- If the total number of coins is even, Alice will always face an even number of coins after her first move. Bob can then always make a move that leaves Alice with an even number of coins, eventually leading to Alice's loss.
- If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, ensuring her victory.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then checks the parity of `a + b` using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`). If the result is `0`, it means the sum is even, and it prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

#### Annotations and Verification:
The annotations describe the program's state correctly:
- The program reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `a` and `b`.
- It checks the parity of `a + b` and prints the correct winner based on the game theory insight.

The annotations verify that the program correctly implements the logic described in the game analysis. The program handles all edge cases, including when `a` and `b` are equal, when one is much larger than the other, and when the sum is at its minimum or maximum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
