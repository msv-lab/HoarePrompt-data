Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. Here's why:

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game revolves around the number of coins in both wallets.
   - The key observation is that the player who starts with an even total number of coins (sum of coins in both wallets) will always lose if both play optimally.
   - This is because each move reduces the total number of coins by 1, and the player who faces an odd total number of coins can always force the opponent into an even total number of coins, eventually leading to a win.

2. **Program Explanation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the sum of coins (`a + b`) is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even (`a + b & 1 == 0`), Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the game analysis.
   - It handles all edge cases:
     - When both wallets have the same number of coins.
     - When one wallet has more coins than the other.
     - When the sum of coins is at its minimum (2) or maximum (2 * 10^9).

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the program correctly determines the winner for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
