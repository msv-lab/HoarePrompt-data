Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9; `test` must be greater than 0; `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the two integers read from the input.**

Natural Language: The values of `t` and `test` remain unchanged. The variables `a` and `b` are now assigned the values of the two integers provided as input.
