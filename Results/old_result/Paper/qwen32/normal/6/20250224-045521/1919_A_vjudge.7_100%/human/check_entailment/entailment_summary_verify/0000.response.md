To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the problem and verify the logic step by step.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns playing with their wallets containing `a` and `b` coins, respectively. Here are the key points:

1. **Game Rules**:
    - Players take turns, with Alice starting first.
    - In each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not swap.
    - After that, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
    - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when their wallet has 0 coins) loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
    - Both players play optimally, meaning they will make moves that maximize their chances of winning.
    - The crucial observation is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner.
    - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will win if both play optimally.
    - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win if both play optimally.

### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks if the sum of the coins is even or odd and prints the winner accordingly.

Here's the program code for reference:

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Function Summary

The function summary states:
- The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

### Original Assessment

The original assessment states that the program is correct because:
- The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins.
- The logic is sound and handles all edge cases.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic:

1. **Parity Check**:
    - The expression `a + b & 1 == 0` checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
    - If true, it prints 'Bob', which aligns with the game analysis.
    - If false, it prints 'Alice', which also aligns with the game analysis.

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - When `a + b` is even, Bob wins.
    - When `a + b` is odd, Alice wins.
    - This covers all possible scenarios given the constraints.

### Conclusion

Given the problem description, the program logic, and the function summary, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, and it handles all edge cases as expected.

Final: **True**
