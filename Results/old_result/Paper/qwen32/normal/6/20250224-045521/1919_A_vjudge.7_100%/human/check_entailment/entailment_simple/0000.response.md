### Reasoning:
To determine the winner of the game, we need to analyze the game mechanics and the provided solution. The key insight here is to understand the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (a + b).

1. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Players take turns.
   - In each turn, a player can either swap wallets or not, and then must take one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Optimal Play**:
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves, ensuring that Bob will always have a move as long as Alice does. This means Bob will win.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a losing position. This means Alice will win.

3. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The provided code correctly checks the parity of the sum of coins (a + b) using the bitwise AND operator (`& 1`). If the result is 0, the sum is even, and it prints "Bob". If the result is 1, the sum is odd, and it prints "Alice".

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the input `1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), so the output is "Bob".
   - For the input `1 4`, the sum is 5 (odd), so the output is "Alice".
   - This matches the expected output for the example cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Your response:
Reasoning: The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins (a + b). If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins. This matches the optimal play strategy described in the problem.
Correctness: **True**
