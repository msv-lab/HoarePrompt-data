### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the number of coins Alice (a) and Bob (b) have in their wallets. The key insight is that the game can be reduced to a simple parity check on the sum of coins (a + b).

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob wins.
- If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice wins.

This is because:
- If the sum is even, Alice will always be forced into a losing position if both play optimally.
- If the sum is odd, Alice can always ensure that Bob is left with an even sum, thus putting Bob in a losing position.

The provided code correctly implements this logic by checking the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` using the bitwise AND operation (`a + b & 1`). If the result is `0`, the sum is even, and it prints 'Bob'. If the result is `1`, the sum is odd, and it prints 'Alice'.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct as it accurately determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

Correctness: **True**
