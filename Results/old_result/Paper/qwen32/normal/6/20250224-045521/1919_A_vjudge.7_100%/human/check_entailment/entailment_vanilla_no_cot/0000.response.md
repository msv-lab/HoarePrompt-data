To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze the logic used to decide the winner of the game based on the number of coins Alice and Bob have.

The provided program uses the following logic:
```python
if a + b & 1 == 0:
    print('Bob')
else:
    print('Alice')
```

This logic is based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Let's analyze why this works:

1. **Parity Analysis**:
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will win.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will win.

2. **Reasoning**:
   - Each turn, a player removes exactly one coin from their wallet.
   - The game continues until one player cannot make a move, which means both wallets are empty.
   - The player who makes the last move (i.e., the player who removes the last coin) wins.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will make moves that maximize their chances of winning.
   - The key insight is that if the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves. For example, if Alice swaps wallets, Bob can swap wallets; if Alice doesn't swap, Bob doesn't swap. This ensures that Bob will always be the one to make the last move.
   - Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can always ensure she makes the last move by playing optimally.

Given this reasoning, the logic in the provided program is correct. Therefore, the response is:

Correctness: **True**
