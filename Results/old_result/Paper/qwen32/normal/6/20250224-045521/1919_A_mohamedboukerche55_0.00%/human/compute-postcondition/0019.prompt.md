You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. For each test case, there is one line containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, `s` is the input string of the last test case, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the last test case, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the last test case.
    #
    #Output State:
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, `s` is the input string of the last test case, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the last test case, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the last test case. Additionally, the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. For each test case, the function returns a value indicating the result based on the comparison of `a` and `b`. Case_1: If `a` is greater than `b`, it returns "Alice". Case_2: If `b` is greater than `a`, it returns "Bob". Case_3: If `a` is equal to `b`, it returns "Tie".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
