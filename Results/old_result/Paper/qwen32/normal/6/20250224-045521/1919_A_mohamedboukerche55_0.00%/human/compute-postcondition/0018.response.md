Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. For each test case, the function returns a value indicating the result based on the comparison of `a` and `b`. Case_1: If `a` is greater than `b`, it returns "Alice". Case_2: If `b` is greater than `a`, it returns "Bob". Case_3: If `a` is equal to `b`, it returns "Tie".**
