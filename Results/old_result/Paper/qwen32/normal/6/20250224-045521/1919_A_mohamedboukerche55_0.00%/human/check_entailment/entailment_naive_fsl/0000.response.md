Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Specifically, the program only considers the parity (odd or even) of the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, which is not the correct strategy for determining the winner when both players play optimally.

To determine the winner correctly, we need to consider the following logic:
- If the number of coins in both wallets is the same, then Alice will always lose because no matter what she does, Bob can mirror her moves and eventually force her into a losing position.
- If the number of coins in the wallets is different, then Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by making the number of coins in both wallets equal after her first move (by swapping if necessary and then removing a coin from the larger wallet).

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate why the provided program is incorrect:
- Input: `1\n2 3`
- Expected Output: `Alice`
- Actual Output: `bob` (incorrect)

In this case, Alice can swap wallets, making the wallets have 3 and 2 coins respectively. Then she can remove a coin from her wallet, making the wallets have 2 and 2 coins. From this point, no matter what Bob does, Alice can mirror his moves and eventually win the game.

The correct implementation should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```
This implementation correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy described above.
