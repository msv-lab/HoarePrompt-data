Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who have coins in their wallets. They take turns to either swap wallets or keep their current one and then remove one coin. The player who cannot make a move loses. The task is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. **Optimal Play**: The players will play optimally, meaning they will make moves that maximize their chances of winning.
2. **Game Dynamics**: The game essentially revolves around the total number of coins (a + b). If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it's odd, Alice wins. This is because:
   - If the total number of coins is even, Alice can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring Bob is the one who runs out of moves first.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always make the total even after her first move, putting Bob in the position of the even case.

### Program Analysis:
Let's look at the provided code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')
```

#### Issues in the Code:
1. **Indentation Error**: The `if` and `else` statements are outside the loop. This means they will only execute after the loop has finished processing all test cases, which is incorrect. They should be inside the loop to handle each test case individually.
2. **Output Formatting**: The code prints "bob  " with an extra space, which does not match the expected output format. It should print "Bob" without any extra spaces.

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the indentation error and the incorrect output formatting. The corrected version of the program should be used to determine the winner correctly based on the total number of coins.

Correctness: **False**
