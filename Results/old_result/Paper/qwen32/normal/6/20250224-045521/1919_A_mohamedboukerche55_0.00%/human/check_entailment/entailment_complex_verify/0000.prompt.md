You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        print('bob  ')
    else:
        print('alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. For each test case, there is one line containing two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, `s` is the input string of the last test case, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the last test case, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the last test case.
    #
    #Output State:
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, `s` is the input string of the last test case, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the last test case, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the last test case. Additionally, the sum of `a` and `b` is either even or not even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. For each test case, it prints "bob" if the sum of the two integers is even, and "alice" if the sum is odd.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Specifically, the program only considers the parity (odd or even) of the sum of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, which is not the correct strategy for determining the winner when both players play optimally.

To determine the winner correctly, we need to consider the following logic:
- If the number of coins in both wallets is the same, then Alice will always lose because no matter what she does, Bob can mirror her moves and eventually force her into a losing position.
- If the number of coins in the wallets is different, then Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by making the number of coins in both wallets equal after her first move (by swapping if necessary and then removing a coin from the larger wallet).

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate why the provided program is incorrect:
- Input: `1\n2 3`
- Expected Output: `Alice`
- Actual Output: `bob` (incorrect)

In this case, Alice can swap wallets, making the wallets have 3 and 2 coins respectively. Then she can remove a coin from her wallet, making the wallets have 2 and 2 coins. From this point, no matter what Bob does, Alice can mirror his moves and eventually win the game.

The correct implementation should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```
This implementation correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy described above.
