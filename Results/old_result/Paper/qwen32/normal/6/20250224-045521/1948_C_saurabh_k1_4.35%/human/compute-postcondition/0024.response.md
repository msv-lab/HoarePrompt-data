Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an even integer `n` representing the length of two strings, and two strings consisting of exactly `n` characters where each character is either '<' or '>'. The function returns "YES" if it's possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that they form valid pairs without crossing, otherwise it returns "NO".**
