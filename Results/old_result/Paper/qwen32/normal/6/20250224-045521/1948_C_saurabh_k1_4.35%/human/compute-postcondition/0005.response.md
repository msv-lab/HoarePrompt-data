The given code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'No'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The variable `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. The variable `n` is assigned the value of `t`.
3. The variable `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
4. The variable `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input.
5. The current value of `b[n - 2]` is `<`.

None of these variables influence the `print('No')` statement. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
