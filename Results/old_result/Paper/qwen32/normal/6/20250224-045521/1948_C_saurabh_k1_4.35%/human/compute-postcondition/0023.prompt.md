Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly n characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'. There are no arrows pointing outside the grid.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(str, input()))
    b = list(map(str, input()))
    if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. If `b[n - 2]` is `<`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `<`. Otherwise, `b[n - 2]` is not equal to the string `'<'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list where each element is a character from the input string. The value of `b[n - 2]` is checked, but the lists `a` and `b` and the value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged regardless of whether `b[n - 2]` equals `str('<')` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the new input, `b` is a list where each element is a character from the new input string. The value of `b[n - 2]` is checked against the string `<`. Regardless of whether `b[n - 2]` equals `<` or not, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
