Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list where each element is a character from the input string. The value of `b[n - 2]` is checked, but the lists `a` and `b` and the value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged regardless of whether `b[n - 2]` equals `str('<')` or not.**
