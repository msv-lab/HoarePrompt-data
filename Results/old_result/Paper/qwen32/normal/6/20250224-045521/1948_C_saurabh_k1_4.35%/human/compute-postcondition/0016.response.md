The only variable in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we do not plan to use. The loop runs for a number of times specified by `int(input())`. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the loop's execution or any other variable in the provided state, we only need to consider how the loop's iteration count is managed.

Given that the loop runs `int(input())` times, the state at the start of the loop should reflect that the loop is about to execute one more time. However, since the state provided does not include the number of iterations left or the initial input, we can only infer that the loop will execute as long as the iteration count is greater than zero.

Since the loop variable `_` does not influence the state, the state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be the same as the end of the previous iteration, except that the loop is about to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list where each element is a character from the input string. The value of `b[n - 2]` is checked, but the lists `a` and `b` and the value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged regardless of whether `b[n - 2]` equals `str('<')` or not.**
