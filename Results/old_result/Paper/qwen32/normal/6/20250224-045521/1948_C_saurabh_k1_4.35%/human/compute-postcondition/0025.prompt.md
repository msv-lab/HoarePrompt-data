You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly n characters, where each character is either '<' or '>'. There are no arrows pointing outside the grid.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: t is 0, n is the last input integer, a is the list of characters from the last input string for the first row, b is the list of characters from the last input string for the second row. The program has printed 'No' if b[n - 2] was '<' for any of the test cases, otherwise it has printed 'Yes'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an even integer `n` representing the length of two strings, and two strings consisting of exactly `n` characters where each character is either '<' or '>'. The function returns "YES" if it's possible to pair each '<' with a '>' such that they form valid pairs without crossing, otherwise it returns "NO".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
