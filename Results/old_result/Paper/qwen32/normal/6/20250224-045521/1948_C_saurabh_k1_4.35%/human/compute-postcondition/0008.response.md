Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is assigned the value of `t`, `a` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input, `b` is a list of strings where each string is a character from the input. If `b[n - 2]` is `<`, then the current value of `b[n - 2]` is `<`. Otherwise, `b[n - 2]` is not equal to the string `'<'`.**
