Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description. The logic in the program is flawed and does not consider the entire path the robot can take, only focusing on the second last cell of the second row.

The program checks if the second last cell of the second row (b[n - 2]) points to the left ('<'). If it does, the program incorrectly concludes that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) and prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This logic is incorrect because the robot can potentially reach (2, n) from other cells, and the direction of the arrow in the second last cell of the second row does not fully determine the robot's ability to reach the target cell.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the robot's movement according to the rules provided and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1).

Correctness: **False**
