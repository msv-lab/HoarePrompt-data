The code creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The set comprehension `set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))` generates characters starting from 'a' (ASCII value 97) up to the `k`-th alphabet character.

Given the initial state, `n`, `k`, and `m` were already defined, and `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The only change here is the creation of the set `us`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
