You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n, k, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. s is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases do not exceed 10^6.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s`. It checks if there are at least `n` sequences of `k` distinct characters in `s`. If so, it prints 'YES'. If not, it prints 'NO' and then constructs and prints a string of length `n` using the characters found in `s` and additional characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets to meet the requirement.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's examine the issues:

1. **Logic Flaw in Subsequence Checking**:
   - The program attempts to find subsequences by keeping a set `win` of characters seen so far. However, it does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`.
   - The program clears the `win` set once it reaches `k` unique characters, which is not the correct way to check for subsequences. It does not consider the order and the possibility of repeating characters in subsequences.

2. **Generating Missing Subsequences**:
   - The part of the code that generates a missing subsequence when the answer is "NO" is also flawed. It does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
The program will output "YES" for this case, which is correct. However, let's consider another case:
```
1
2 2 3
abb
```
The program will output "NO" and generate a string, but the generated string might not be correct. For example, it might output "aa" or "bb", but the correct missing subsequence should be "aa" because "aa" is not a subsequence of "abb".

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, output "NO" and print that string.

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def is_subsequence(s, t):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in t)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    alphabet = ''.join(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    
    missing = None
    for string in all_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(s, string):
            missing = string
            break
    
    if missing:
        print("NO")
        print(missing)
    else:
        print("YES")
```

This code generates all possible strings of length `n` and checks each one to see if it is a subsequence of `s`. If a missing subsequence is found, it is printed. Otherwise, "YES" is printed.
