The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the set `us`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current value of `i` and how it will change as the loop progresses.

Given:
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `i` is the current character being processed in the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some character in `us`. For the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the set `us`. Since sets are unordered in Python, we cannot predict the exact order of iteration. However, we know that `i` will take on the value of the next element in the iteration sequence of `us`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set or contains some characters from `s` but does not contain `i` if `i` was not in `win` before the if statement, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each sequence of `k` distinct characters found in `s`, and `ps` is the number of such sequences found in `s` and `ps` is less than `n`. If `i` was not in `win`, it remains unchanged. `i` is the next character in the set `us` for the next iteration.**

Since we cannot determine the exact next character in the set `us` due to its unordered nature, we represent the state with the understanding that `i` will be the next element in the iteration sequence of `us`.
