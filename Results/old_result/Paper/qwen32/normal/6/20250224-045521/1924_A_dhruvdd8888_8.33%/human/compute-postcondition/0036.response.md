Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set or contains some characters from `s` but does not contain `i`, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each sequence of `k` distinct characters found in `s`, `ps` is the number of such sequences found in `s` and `ps` is less than `n`. The current character `i` is not in `win`.**
