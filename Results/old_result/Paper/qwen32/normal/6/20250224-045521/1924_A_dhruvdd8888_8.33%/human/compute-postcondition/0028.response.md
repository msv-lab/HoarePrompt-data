Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `i` is the next character in the string `s` (i.e., `s[j+1]` where `j` is the current index of `i` in `s`). If `i` is in `us`, then `win` includes the character `i`. If `len(win) == k`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` includes the character `i`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `win` retains the character `i`. If `i` is not in `us`, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.**
