To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the components involved in the expression `''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` based on the given initial state:

1. **`ans`**: This is a list that contains the last character of each sequence of `k` distinct characters found in the string `s`. Since the exact sequences and their last characters are not provided, we'll denote the final content of `ans` as a list of characters, e.g., `['x', 'y', ...]`.

2. **`i`**: This is the current character that is not in the set `win`. Since the exact value of `i` is not provided, we'll denote it as `i`.

3. **`n`**: This is an integer representing the total number of characters that need to be printed. It is given that `1 ≤ n ≤ 26`.

4. **`len(ans)`**: This is the number of elements in the list `ans`. Since the exact length of `ans` is not provided, we'll denote it as `len(ans)`.

5. **`'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`**: This part of the expression generates a string consisting of the character `'a'` repeated `(n - len(ans) - 1)` times. This ensures that the total number of characters in the final output is `n`.

Putting it all together, the `print` statement constructs a string by:
- Joining the characters in the list `ans` into a single string.
- Appending the character `i`.
- Appending a number of `'a'` characters such that the total length of the string is `n`.

Therefore, the output will be a string that consists of:
- The characters in `ans` joined together.
- Followed by the character `i`.
- Followed by enough `'a'` characters to make the total length of the string equal to `n`.

Output: **`''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` (where `ans` is the list of last characters of sequences of `k` distinct characters found in `s`, `i` is the current character not in `win`, and `n` is the total number of characters to be printed)**
