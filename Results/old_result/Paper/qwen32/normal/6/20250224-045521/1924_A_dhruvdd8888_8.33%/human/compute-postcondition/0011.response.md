Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5; `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; `s` is a string of length m consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets read from the input; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets; `win` is a set containing the current value of `i` and has a length equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing the current value of `i`; `ps` is 1; the current value of `i` is in `us`.**

The value of `ps` has been incremented by 1, changing it from 0 to 1. All other variables retain their initial values.
