### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly generate the required permutation for all cases, as identified in the original assessment. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `n`, creates a list of integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices, and prints the modified list.
   - This process is repeated for `t` test cases.

2. **Issues Identified**:
   - **Reversing Even Indices**: The approach of reversing the elements at even indices does not guarantee that the condition \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\) is avoided for all values of \(n\).
   - **General Case Failure**: For larger values of \(n\), this approach can fail to produce a valid permutation. For example, as mentioned in the original assessment, for \(n = 6\), the output `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6]` is invalid because \(3\) divides \(1\) and \(2\) divides \(4\).

3. **Counterexample**:
   - For \(n = 6\):
     - The code would output: `[3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6]`
     - This permutation is invalid because \(3\) divides \(1\) and \(2\) divides \(4\).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve constructing a permutation that avoids the condition \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\). One such approach is to interleave odd and even numbers in a specific manner. For example, for \(n = 6\), a valid permutation could be `[2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5]`.

### Evaluation:

Given the above points, the original assessment is correct in stating that the provided program does not correctly generate the required permutation for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
