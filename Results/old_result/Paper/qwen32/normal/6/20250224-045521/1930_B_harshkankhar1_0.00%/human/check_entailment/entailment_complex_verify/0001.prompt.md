You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)
    #This is printed: a (where a is a list of integers from 1 to n with elements at even indices reversed)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, creates a list of integers from 1 to `n`, reverses the elements at even indices, and prints the modified list. This process is repeated for `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer specified at the beginning, and each `n` for the test cases must satisfy 3 <= n <= 10^5 with the total sum of all `n` not exceeding 10^5.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires constructing a permutation of integers from 1 to n such that for any two distinct indices i and j, the conditions \( p_i \mid p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \mid p_{j+1} \) do not hold simultaneously.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it constructs a permutation by:
1. Creating a list `a` of integers from 1 to n.
2. Reversing the elements at even indices (0-based) in the list.
3. Printing the resulting list.

### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement with the given program.

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `4`
- List before modification: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- List after modification (reversing elements at even indices): `[4, 2, 1, 3]`
- Output: `4 2 1 3`

Let's verify if this permutation satisfies the conditions:
- For \( i=0 \) (p_1=4), \( j=2 \) (p_3=1): 4 does not divide 1, so condition is satisfied.
- For \( i=0 \) (p_1=4), \( j=3 \) (p_4=3): 4 does not divide 3, so condition is satisfied.
- For \( i=1 \) (p_2=2), \( j=3 \) (p_4=3): 2 does not divide 3, so condition is satisfied.
- For \( i=2 \) (p_3=1), \( j=3 \) (p_4=3): 1 divides 3, but there is no \( p_{i+1} \mid p_{j+1} \) to check, so condition is satisfied.

The permutation `[4, 2, 1, 3]` is valid.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `3`
- List before modification: `[1, 2, 3]`
- List after modification (reversing elements at even indices): `[3, 2, 1]`
- Output: `3 2 1`

Let's verify if this permutation satisfies the conditions:
- For \( i=0 \) (p_1=3), \( j=1 \) (p_2=2): 3 does not divide 2, so condition is satisfied.
- For \( i=0 \) (p_1=3), \( j=2 \) (p_3=1): 3 does not divide 1, so condition is satisfied.
- For \( i=1 \) (p_2=2), \( j=2 \) (p_3=1): 2 does not divide 1, so condition is satisfied.

The permutation `[3, 2, 1]` is valid.

### General Analysis:
The program's approach of reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the resulting permutation avoids the condition \( p_i \mid p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \mid p_{j+1} \) for any distinct indices i and j. This is because the even-indexed elements are in descending order, and the odd-indexed elements are in ascending order, which disrupts any potential divisibility pattern that could occur between pairs of elements and their subsequent elements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring that the conditions specified are met for all test cases.
