Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` such that 3 <= n <= 100,000. The sum of all `n` values across the test cases does not exceed 100,000. The function returns a specific value or result for each test case based on the input `n`.**
