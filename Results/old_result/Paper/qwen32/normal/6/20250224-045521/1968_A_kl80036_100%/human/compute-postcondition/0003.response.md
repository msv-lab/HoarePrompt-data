To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This means `t` can be any integer from 1 to 1000, inclusive.
- For each of the following `t` lines, `x` is an integer input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`.

### Code Execution:
- The code snippet provided is a single `print(y)` statement.
- For each of the `t` lines of input, a value of `x` is provided, and `y` is calculated as `x - 1`.
- The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y` for each line of input.

### Explanation:
- Since `y` is defined as `x - 1`, and `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000, the value of `y` will be an integer between 1 and 999.
- The code will print the value of `y` for each of the `t` lines of input.

### Output:
- The output will be a series of `t` lines, each containing the value of `y` calculated for the corresponding `x` from the input.

### Final Answer:
Output: **y (where y is calculated as x - 1 for each of the t lines of input, with x being an integer between 2 and 1000)**

This description captures the most precise output based on the given initial state and the code snippet provided.
