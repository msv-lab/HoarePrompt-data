To determine the final output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's break down the given loop and the states after the first few iterations.

The loop is:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    y = x - 1
    print(y)
```

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer input at the beginning.
- For each iteration `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `t-1`):
  - An integer `x` is read from the input.
  - `y` is calculated as `x - 1`.
  - `y` is printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- For each of the following `t` lines, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.

### Output States after Iterations:
- **After the loop executes 1 time**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and `y` is equal to `x - 1`.
- **After the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `y` is equal to `x - 1` for each iteration, and the loop has run 2 times.
- **After the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer input such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `y` is equal to `x - 1` for each iteration, and the loop has run 3 times.

### Final Output State:
After all `t` iterations, the loop will have read `t` integers `x`, calculated `y = x - 1` for each `x`, and printed each `y`. The value of `i` will have incremented from 0 to `t-1`, completing all iterations.

The state of `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of iterations to be performed. The variables `x` and `y` will not retain their values after the loop ends, as they are recalculated in each iteration.

### Conclusion:
The final output state is that the loop has executed `t` times, and for each of the `t` iterations, an integer `x` was read, `y` was calculated as `x - 1`, and `y` was printed.

Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, an integer `x` was read such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, `y` was calculated as `x - 1`, and `y` was printed. The value of `t` remains unchanged.**
