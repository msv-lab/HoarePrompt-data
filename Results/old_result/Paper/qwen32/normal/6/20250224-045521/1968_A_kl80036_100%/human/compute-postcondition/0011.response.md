Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

- `i` is incremented by 1. However, the value of `i` before this increment is not specified, so the exact value of `i` after the increment is not relevant to the `print(y)` statement.
- `x` is an input integer. The exact value of `x` is not provided, but we know it is an integer.
- `y` is defined as `x - 1`. Therefore, `y` will be the value of `x` minus 1.

The `print(y)` statement will output the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can't provide a numerical value for `y`. However, we can describe the output precisely based on the given information.

Output: **y (where y is x - 1 and x is the input integer)**
