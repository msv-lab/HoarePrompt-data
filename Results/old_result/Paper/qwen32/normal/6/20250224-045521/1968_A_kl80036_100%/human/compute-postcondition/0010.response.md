The value of `y` is assigned the value of `x - 1`. The variable `i` is already incremented by 1 according to the initial state, and `x` is an input integer. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is `x - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x - 1`**.
