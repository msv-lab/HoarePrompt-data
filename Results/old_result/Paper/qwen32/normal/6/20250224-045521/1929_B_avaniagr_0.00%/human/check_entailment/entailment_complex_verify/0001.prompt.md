You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives input for multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. n represents the size of the square grid, and k represents the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell.

    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The output state is the concatenation of the printed values for all test cases, with each value on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. It calculates and prints a value for each test case, which indicates the result of a condition related to coloring cells in an `n` by `n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given program step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Analysis

The task is to color the minimum number of cells in an `n x n` grid such that at least `k` diagonals contain at least one colored cell. The grid has `4n - 2` diagonals in total, consisting of `2n - 1` diagonals running from the top-left to the bottom-right and `2n - 1` diagonals running from the top-right to the bottom-left.

### Key Observations

- If `k <= 2n - 1`, we can achieve the requirement by coloring cells along two intersecting diagonals (one from top-left to bottom-right and one from top-right to bottom-left). The number of cells needed is `k // 2 + k % 2` because we can cover two diagonals with each pair of cells, and we need to account for any remaining diagonal if `k` is odd.
- If `k > 2n - 1` but `k < 4n - 3`, we need to cover more diagonals. The formula `(k // 2 + k % 2)` still applies because we can continue to cover two diagonals with each pair of cells until we reach the limit.
- If `k = 4n - 2`, we need to cover all diagonals except one. The minimum number of cells required is `2n - 1` for one set of diagonals plus one additional cell to cover the last diagonal, totaling `2n`.
- If `k = 4n - 3`, we need to cover all diagonals except two. The minimum number of cells required is `2n - 1` for one set of diagonals plus two additional cells to cover the last two diagonals, totaling `2n + 1`.
- If `k >= 4n - 3`, the minimum number of cells required is `2n` because we can cover all diagonals by coloring one cell per diagonal in one set of diagonals.

### Program Analysis

The program's logic is as follows:

- `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: This part calculates the number of cells needed if `k < 4n - 3`. It uses the formula `k // 2 + k % 2` to cover diagonals in pairs.
- `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This part calculates the number of cells needed if `k >= 4n - 3`. It uses `2n` as the number of cells required.
- `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This part adds one additional cell if `k = 4n - 2` to cover the last diagonal.

However, there is a logical error in the program:

- The condition `(k == 4 * n - 2)` should not be added separately because it is already covered by the `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)` part. When `k = 4n - 2`, the condition `k >= 4n - 3` is true, and the program will already output `2n`, which is correct for `k = 4n - 2`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect due to the unnecessary addition of `(k == 4 * n - 2)`, which can lead to incorrect results.
