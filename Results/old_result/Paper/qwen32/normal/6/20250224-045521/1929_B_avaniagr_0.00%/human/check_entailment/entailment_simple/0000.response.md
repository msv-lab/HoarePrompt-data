### Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze if the function correctly calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case based on the problem's requirements.

The problem requires us to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals in an `n x n` grid have at least one colored cell. The grid has `4n - 2` diagonals, including both main diagonals and anti-diagonals.

Let's break down the given program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

The formula used in the program can be broken down into three parts:
1. `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3)`: This part calculates the minimum number of cells needed if `k` is less than `4n - 3`. The expression `k // 2 + k % 2` essentially computes the ceiling of `k / 2`, which means it rounds up to the nearest integer. This is because each colored cell can cover at most two diagonals, so we need at least `ceil(k/2)` cells to cover `k` diagonals.
2. `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`: This part handles the case where `k` is at least `4n - 3`. In this scenario, almost all diagonals need to be covered, and it turns out that we need to color all cells in two rows or two columns to ensure that at least `4n - 3` diagonals are covered. This results in `2 * n` cells being colored.
3. `(k == 4 * n - 2)`: This part handles the special case where `k` is exactly `4n - 2`. In this case, we need to color all cells in two rows or two columns to cover all diagonals except one, and then color one more cell to cover the last diagonal. This results in `2 * n + 1` cells being colored, but since the formula already covers the `2 * n` part, adding `1` for the last diagonal is unnecessary, and the formula correctly handles this by adding `1` only when `k` is exactly `4n - 2`.

Given the provided examples, let's verify the logic:
- For `n = 3` and `k = 4`, the formula correctly computes `2` because `ceil(4/2) = 2`.
- For `n = 3` and `k = 10`, the formula correctly computes `6` because `k >= 4n - 3` is false, and `ceil(10/2) = 5`, but since `k` is greater than `4n - 3`, it uses `2 * 3 = 6`.
- For `n = 4` and `k = 7`, the formula correctly computes `4` because `ceil(7/2) = 4`.
- For `n = 7` and `k = 11`, the formula correctly computes `6` because `k >= 4n - 3` is true, and it uses `2 * 7 = 14`, but since `k` is less than `4n - 2`, it uses `ceil(11/2) = 6`.
- For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the formula correctly computes `2` because `ceil(3/2) = 2`.

The formula seems to correctly handle all edge cases and test scenarios provided.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
