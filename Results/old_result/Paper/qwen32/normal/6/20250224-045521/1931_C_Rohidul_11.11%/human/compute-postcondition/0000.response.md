In the given task, the for loop iterates over a range determined by the integer value of `t`, which is read from the input. The loop body is not provided, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the state before the loop starts.

Let's break down the loop head:

- The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input()))`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is an integer input by the user.

To ensure the loop executes, the only state variable we need to adjust is `t` because it directly controls the number of iterations. Since `t` must be an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, we need to make sure `t` is within this range.

The variables `n` and `a` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They are mentioned as part of the problem description for each test case within the loop but are not directly relevant to the loop's execution itself.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
