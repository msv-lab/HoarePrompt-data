The code reads a line of input, splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
