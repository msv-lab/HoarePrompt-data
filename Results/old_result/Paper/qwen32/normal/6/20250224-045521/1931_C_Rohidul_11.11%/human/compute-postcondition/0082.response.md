The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `l` is 1, so after the operation `l += 1`, `l` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers read from the input with `a[0] == a[1]` and `a[1] == a[2]`; `l` is 2; `r` must be greater than 1; `st` is 2; `end` is 0**.
