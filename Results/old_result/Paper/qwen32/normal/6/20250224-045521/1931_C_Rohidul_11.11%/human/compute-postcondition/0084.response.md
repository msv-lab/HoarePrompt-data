To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand what the loop does and how it affects the variables `l`, `st`, and `ans`.

The loop increments `l` and `st` as long as `a[l]` is equal to `a[l + 1]`. This means that `l` will keep increasing as long as the elements at the start of the list `a` are identical. The variable `st` keeps track of how many times this condition has been met.

### Observations:
1. **Initial State**: `l` starts at 0 and `st` starts at 0.
2. **First Iteration**: If `a[0] == a[1]`, then `l` becomes 1 and `st` becomes 1.
3. **Second Iteration**: If `a[1] == a[2]`, then `l` becomes 2 and `st` becomes 2.
4. **Third Iteration**: If `a[2] == a[3]`, then `l` becomes 3 and `st` becomes 3.

This pattern continues until `a[l]` is no longer equal to `a[l + 1]`.

### Final State:
The loop will terminate when `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l + 1]`. At this point, `l` will be the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor, and `st` will be the count of how many identical elements were found at the start of the list.

### Calculation of `ans`:
- If `a[0] == a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`.
- If `a[0] != a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l` unless `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, in which case `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `a` and `r`, we can only describe the final state in terms of the loop variables:

- `l` will be the index of the first element that is not equal to its successor.
- `st` will be the count of how many identical elements were found at the start of the list.

### Output State:
Given the provided information and the loop's behavior, the final output state can be described as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `a` is the list of integers read from the input; `l` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the start of the list ends; `r` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the end of the list ends; `st` is the count of identical elements at the start of the list; `end` is 0; if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l` unless `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, in which case `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**

In simpler terms, `l` and `st` will reflect the number of identical elements at the start of the list, and `ans` will be calculated based on the conditions provided.
