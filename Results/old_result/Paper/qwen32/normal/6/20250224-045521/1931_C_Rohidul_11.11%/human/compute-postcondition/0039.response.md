The code snippet provided resets the variables `st` and `end` to 0. The initial state specifies that `st` and `end` are already initialized to 0, so this operation does not change their values. Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the explicit reassignment of `st` and `end` to 0, which is already their state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the list of integers read from the input; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 0; `end` is 0; If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, and either `st` is not 0 or `end` is not 0, `ans` is 1. If `st` is 0, `end` is 0, and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**
