Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the input integer; `a` is the list of integers read from the input; `l` is the index where the sequence of identical elements starting from `a[0]` ends, or `n - 1` if all elements are identical; `r` is the index where the sequence of identical elements at the end of the list ends; `st` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from `a[0]`; `end` is the count of consecutive identical elements at the end of the list; if `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `r - l` unless `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, in which case `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**
