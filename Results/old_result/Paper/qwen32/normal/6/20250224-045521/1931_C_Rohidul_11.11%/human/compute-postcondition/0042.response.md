Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the list of integers read from the input where `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`; `l` is 1; `r` is `n - 1`; `st` is 1; `end` is 0; `ans` is determined based on the values of `a[0]` and `a[-1]`, and the values of `st` and `end`.**

The value of `st` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
