The code snippet `end += 1` increments the value of the variable `end` by 1. Given the initial state, `end` was 2. Therefore, after executing the code, `end` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are equal and at least one pair of consecutive elements are different; `l` is the first index where `a[l] != a[l + 1]`; `r` is `l + 1`; `st` is the count of consecutive equal elements from the start of the list; `end` is 3**.
