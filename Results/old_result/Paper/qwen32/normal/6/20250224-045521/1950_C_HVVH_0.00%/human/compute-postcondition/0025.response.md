Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `h` and `m` are the new hour and minute parts of the input time read from the input, `day` is 'PM'.**

In simple terms, the variable `day` has been set to 'PM', while the values of `t`, `s`, `n`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
