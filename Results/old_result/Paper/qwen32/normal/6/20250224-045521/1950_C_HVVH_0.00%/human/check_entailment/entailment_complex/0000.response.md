Reasoning:  
The program provided correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program first reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Parsing Time:**
   - The string `s` is split into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`) using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.

3. **Conversion Logic:**
   - If `h` (hour) is 0, it is converted to 12 and the day is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it is converted to the equivalent 12-hour format by subtracting 12, and the day is set to 'PM'.
   - If `h` is exactly 12, the day remains 'PM'.
   - If `h` is between 1 and 11, the day is set to 'AM'.

4. **Output:**
   - The converted time is printed in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", ensuring that the hour is always displayed with two digits using `f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}'`.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including:
- Midnight (00:00) which should be 12:00 AM.
- Noon (12:00) which should be 12:00 PM.
- Times between 01:00 and 11:59 which should be in AM.
- Times between 13:00 and 23:59 which should be in PM.

Given the above reasoning and the provided example, the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
