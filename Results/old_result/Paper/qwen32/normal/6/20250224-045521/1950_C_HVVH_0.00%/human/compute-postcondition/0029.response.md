Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `m` remains unchanged. If `h` was 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` was greater than 12, `h` is `h - 12` and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` was 12, `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.**
