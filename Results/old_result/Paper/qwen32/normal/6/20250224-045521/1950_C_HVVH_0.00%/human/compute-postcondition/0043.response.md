Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is 0, `m` is the minute part of the input time, and `h` and `day` are determined based on the value of `h` for the last input time. If `h` is 0, `h` is set to 12 and `day` is 'AM'. If `h` is greater than 12, `h` is reduced by 12 and `day` is 'PM'. If `h` is 12, `day` remains 'PM'. If `h` is less than 12, `day` remains 'PM' unless `h` is 0, in which case `day` is set to 'AM'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop counter `n` will be reduced to 0. The variables `h` and `day` will reflect the last processed time in 12-hour format with AM/PM, while `t` and `s` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
