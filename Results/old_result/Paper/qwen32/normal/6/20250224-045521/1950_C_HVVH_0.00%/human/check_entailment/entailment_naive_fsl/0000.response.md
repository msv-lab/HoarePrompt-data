Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all edge cases correctly, specifically when the hour is 12. Let's examine the problematic part of the code:

```python
if h == 0:
    h = 12
    day = 'AM'
elif h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
else:
    day = 'PM'
    if h == 12:
        day = 'AM'
```

In this code:
- When `h` is 0, it correctly sets `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
- When `h` is greater than 12, it correctly sets `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
- However, when `h` is 12, the `else` block sets `day` to 'PM' first and then changes it to 'AM' if `h` is 12. This is incorrect because it should set `day` to 'PM' when `h` is 12, not 'AM'.

The correct handling for `h` being 12 should be:
- If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'PM'.
- If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
- If `h` is between 1 and 11, set `day` to 'AM'.
- If `h` is between 13 and 23, set `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.

Here is the corrected part of the code:

```python
if h == 0:
    h = 12
    day = 'AM'
elif h == 12:
    day = 'PM'
elif h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
else:
    day = 'AM'
```

This ensures that all edge cases, including when `h` is 12, are handled correctly. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
