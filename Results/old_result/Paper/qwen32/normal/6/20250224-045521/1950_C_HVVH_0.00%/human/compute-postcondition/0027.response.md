Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 with the format "hh:mm", `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `h` and `m` are the new hour and minute parts of the input time read from the input. If `h` is 12, `day` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `day` remains 'PM'.**
