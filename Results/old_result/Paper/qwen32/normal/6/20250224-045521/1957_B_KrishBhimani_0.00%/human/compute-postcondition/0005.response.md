The variable `i` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0**.
