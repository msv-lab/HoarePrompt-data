The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which iterates over the elements of the list `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `arr` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is `[0]`, and `i` was `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least one more element. Since the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, adding another element to `arr` will allow the loop to execute again with the new element.

Let's assume that the next element to be added to `arr` is `1` (or any other integer, but we need to maintain consistency with the given state changes).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is 1, `ans` is either `[1 << i]` if `c` was less than `n - 1`, or `[k0, 1 << i]` if `c` was equal to `n - 1`**.
