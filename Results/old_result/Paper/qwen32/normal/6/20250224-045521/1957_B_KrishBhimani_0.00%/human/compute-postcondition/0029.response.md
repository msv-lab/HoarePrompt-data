Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [1] if `c` is `n - 1`, otherwise `ans` is an empty list, and `c` is `n - 1` if `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, otherwise `c` retains its original value.**
