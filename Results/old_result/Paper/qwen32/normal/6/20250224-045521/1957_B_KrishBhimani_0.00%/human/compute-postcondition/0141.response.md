To determine the final output state after all the iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case. The loop processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it performs the following steps:

1. Converts `k` to its binary representation and stores the indices of the set bits in `arr`.
2. Initializes `ans` with values `1 << i` for each index `i` in `arr` until `ans` has `n` elements. If `ans` has fewer than `n` elements after processing all indices in `arr`, it appends `0`s to make the length of `ans` equal to `n`.
3. If `ans` has fewer than `n` elements and the sum of the elements in `ans` is less than `k`, the last element in `ans` is adjusted to be `k - sum(ans)`.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the output will be a list of `n` integers, where each integer is either a power of 2 corresponding to a set bit in `k` or `0`.
- If the number of set bits in `k` is less than `n`, the remaining elements in the list will be `0`.
- If the number of set bits in `k` is exactly `n`, the list will contain `n` powers of 2.
- If the number of set bits in `k` is more than `n`, only the first `n` set bits will be used, and the remaining elements will be `0`.

Since the loop processes each test case independently, the output state after all iterations will be a series of lists, each corresponding to a test case.

Output State: **a series of lists, each of length `n` corresponding to each test case, where each element is either a power of 2 corresponding to a set bit in `k` or `0`, and the sum of the elements in each list is less than or equal to `k`**.

In simpler terms, the final output will be a series of lists, each of length `n`, where each list contains the powers of 2 corresponding to the set bits in `k` for that test case, padded with zeros if necessary, and the sum of the elements in each list does not exceed `k`.
