The provided code snippet reassigns the variable `l1` to the result of `input().split()`. This means `l1` will now hold a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is 2, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2.**
