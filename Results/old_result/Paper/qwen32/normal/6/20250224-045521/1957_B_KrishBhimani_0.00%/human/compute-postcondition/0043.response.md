The code appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 1, `1 << i` evaluates to `1 << 1`, which is `2`. Therefore, `ans` will now contain the values `[2, -1, 2, 2]`.

The other variables remain unchanged as per the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 2`, and `ans` is [2, -1, 2, 2]**.
