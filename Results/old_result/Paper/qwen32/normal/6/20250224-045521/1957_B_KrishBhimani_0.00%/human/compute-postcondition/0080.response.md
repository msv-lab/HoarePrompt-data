The code appends to the list `ans` the value `k0 - sum(ans)`. Given the initial state, we need to determine the new value of `ans`.

- `ans` initially contains either `[1 << i]` or `[k0, 1 << i]`.
- `sum(ans)` will be either `1 << i` or `k0 + 1 << i`.
- The new element being appended is `k0 - sum(ans)`.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `ans` is `[1 << i]`:
   - `sum(ans) = 1 << i`.
   - The new element to append is `k0 - (1 << i)`.
   - `ans` becomes `[1 << i, k0 - (1 << i)]`.

2. If `ans` is `[k0, 1 << i]`:
   - `sum(ans) = k0 + 1 << i`.
   - The new element to append is `k0 - (k0 + 1 << i) = - (1 << i)`.
   - `ans` becomes `[k0, 1 << i, - (1 << i)]`.

The values of other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is 1, `ans` is either `[1 << i, k0 - (1 << i)]` if `c` was less than `n - 1`, or `[k0, 1 << i, - (1 << i)]` if `c` was equal to `n - 1`**.
