The code snippet `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1` left-shifted by `i` bits to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `1 << 1` evaluates to 2. Therefore, the value 2 is appended to `ans`.

Let's consider the possible states of `ans` before this operation:
1. If `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, `ans` was `[1, 2, -2]`.
2. Otherwise, `ans` was `[2, -1]`.

After appending `1 << i` (which is 2), the new values for `ans` will be:
1. If `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, `ans` will be `[1, 2, -2, 2]`.
2. Otherwise, `ans` will be `[2, -1, 2]`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `i`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`. If `c` was `n - 1` before the if statement, `ans` is `[1, 2, -2, 2]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is `[2, -1, 2]`.**
