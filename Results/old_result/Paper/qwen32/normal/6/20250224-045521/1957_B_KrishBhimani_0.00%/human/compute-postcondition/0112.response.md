The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `arr` is initially `[0, 1]` if `k & 1 == 1` (which is true since `k` is an odd number), or `[0]` otherwise. Since `k` is an odd number, `arr` is `[0, 1]` initially. After appending `i` (which is 2), `arr` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is an odd number greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1, 2]`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`, and `i` is 2**.
