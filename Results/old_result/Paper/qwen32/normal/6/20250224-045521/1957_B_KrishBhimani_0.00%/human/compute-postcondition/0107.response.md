The code snippet `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `arr` will have `1` appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

If `k & 1 == 1`, `arr` initially contains `[0]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[0, 1]`. If `k & 1 == 0`, `arr` initially is an empty list `[]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1]`.

The values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `c`, and `ans` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]` if `k & 1 == 1`, otherwise `arr` is `[1]`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]` if `k & 1 == 1`, otherwise `ans` remains as `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`, and `i` is 1**
