The code snippet `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is an empty list, and `k0` is 1. Therefore, `sum(ans)` is 0. So, `k0 - sum(ans)` evaluates to `1 - 0`, which is `1`. This value is then appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `arr` is [0], `ans` is [1], `c` is `n - 1`.**
