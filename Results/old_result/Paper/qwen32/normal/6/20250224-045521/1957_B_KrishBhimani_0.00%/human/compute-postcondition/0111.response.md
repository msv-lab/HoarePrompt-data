The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `k // 2`, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be greater than 0.

Since `k` is being halved in each iteration, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `k` is an odd number before it gets halved in the next iteration (because halving an odd number will result in a non-zero integer).

Therefore, `k` must be an odd number greater than 0 before the next iteration starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is an odd number greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]` if `k & 1 == 1`, otherwise `arr` is `[0]`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`, and `i` is 2**
