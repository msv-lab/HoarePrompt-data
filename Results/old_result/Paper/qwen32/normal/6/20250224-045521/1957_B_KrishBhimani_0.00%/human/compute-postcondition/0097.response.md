The code snippet `arr = []` reassigns the variable `arr` to an empty list. This change affects the variable `arr` only, and all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `c` is `n`, `ans` is `[1 << arr[0], 1 << arr[1], ..., 1 << arr[n-1], k0 - sum(ans)]`.**
