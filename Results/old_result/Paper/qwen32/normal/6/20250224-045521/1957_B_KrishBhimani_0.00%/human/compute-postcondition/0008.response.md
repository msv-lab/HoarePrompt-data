Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace where the second element must be a non-zero integer; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and `k` is odd; `arr` is a list containing the integer 0; `k0` is equal to `k`; `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `arr`, making `arr` now equal to `[0]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
