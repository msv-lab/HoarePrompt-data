Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`, `c` is 0, `ans` is `[]`, and `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `k` plus one.**

In this output state, the only change is that the variable `c` has been set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values as described in the initial state.
