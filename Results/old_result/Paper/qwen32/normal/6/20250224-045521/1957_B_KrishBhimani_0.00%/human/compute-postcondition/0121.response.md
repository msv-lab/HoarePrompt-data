The code appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is an empty list, so `sum(ans)` is 0. Therefore, the value being appended is `k0 - 0`, which simplifies to `k0`.

Thus, `ans` now contains one element, which is `k0`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the original `l1`, `k` is an integer with at least one set bit, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of the original `l1`, `arr` is a list containing the indices of the set bits in the original `k`, `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is `[k0]`, and `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `k` plus one.**
