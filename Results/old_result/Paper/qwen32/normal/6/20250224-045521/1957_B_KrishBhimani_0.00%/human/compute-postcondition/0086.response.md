Let's break down the code snippet and the initial state to understand the changes:

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is 1
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `arr` is `[0, 1]`
- `c` is 2
- If `c` was less than `n - 1`, `ans` is `[1 << i, 1 << i]`. If `c` was equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is `[k0, 1 << i, -(1 << i), 1 << i]`. The loop will terminate after this iteration as `i` has iterated over all elements in `arr`.

Given that `c` is 2, and the loop will terminate after this iteration, we can infer that `c` was equal to `n - 1` at the start of this iteration. Therefore, `ans` was `[k0, 1 << i, -(1 << i), 1 << i]`.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
```

This line appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is calculated as `k0 - sum(ans)`. Let's calculate the sum of `ans` before appending the new element:
- `sum(ans) = k0 + (1 << i) + -(1 << i) + (1 << i) = k0 + (1 << i)`

Thus, the new element to be appended is:
- `k0 - sum(ans) = k0 - (k0 + (1 << i)) = - (1 << i)`

After appending, `ans` becomes:
- `ans = [k0, 1 << i, -(1 << i), 1 << i, -(1 << i)]`

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `c` is 2, `ans` is `[k0, 1 << i, -(1 << i), 1 << i, -(1 << i)]`**.
