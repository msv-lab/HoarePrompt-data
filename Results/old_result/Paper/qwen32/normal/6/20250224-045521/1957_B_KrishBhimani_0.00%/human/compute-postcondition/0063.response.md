The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after the increment, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `k0` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ans` is [2, -2], and `c` is 2. If `k` (before the shift) is odd, `arr` is [0, 1]. Otherwise, `arr` is [1].**
