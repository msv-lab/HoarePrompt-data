The `break` statement will terminate the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `i`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input line on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 1, `arr` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is [2, -1, 2, -2] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
