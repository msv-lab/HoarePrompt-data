Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `res` is defined based on the value of `k`:
  - If `k == n`, then `res` is `[1] * n`, which means a list of `n` ones.
  - If `k == 1`, then `res` is `range(n)`, which means a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`.
  - Otherwise, `res` is `[-1]`, which is a list containing a single element `-1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*res)
```

### Analysis:
The `print(*res)` statement unpacks the list `res` and prints its elements separated by spaces.

- **Case 1: `k == n`**
  - `res` is `[1] * n`, so the output will be `n` ones separated by spaces.
  - Example: If `n = 5`, the output will be `1 1 1 1 1`.

- **Case 2: `k == 1`**
  - `res` is `range(n)`, so the output will be integers from 0 to `n-1` separated by spaces.
  - Example: If `n = 5`, the output will be `0 1 2 3 4`.

- **Case 3: `k != n` and `k != 1`**
  - `res` is `[-1]`, so the output will be `-1`.

### Final Answer:
Based on the above analysis, the output depends on the value of `k` relative to `n`.

- If `k == n`, the output is `n` ones separated by spaces.
- If `k == 1`, the output is integers from 0 to `n-1` separated by spaces.
- If `k` is neither `n` nor `1`, the output is `-1`.

Output: **n ones separated by spaces if k == n, integers from 0 to n-1 separated by spaces if k == 1, otherwise -1**
