Output State: **`t` is `0`; `n` and `k` are undefined as the loop has finished executing; `res` is undefined as the loop has finished executing.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be `0` because the loop runs `t` times and decrements `t` implicitly with each iteration. The variables `n` and `k` will be undefined because they are reassigned in each iteration based on the input and are not retained after the loop ends. Similarly, `res` will be undefined after the loop finishes as it is a local variable within the loop and its value is not retained outside the loop.
