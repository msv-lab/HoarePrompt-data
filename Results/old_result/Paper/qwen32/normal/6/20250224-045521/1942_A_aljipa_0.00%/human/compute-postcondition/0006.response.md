The code snippet provided reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `n` and `k` is described as the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The other variables (`t` and `res`) are not affected by this code snippet.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the new integers read from the input. The values of `t` and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer from the new input; `k` is the second integer from the new input; `res` is `[1] * n` if `k == n`, `range(n)` if `k == 1`, otherwise `res` is `[-1]`.**
