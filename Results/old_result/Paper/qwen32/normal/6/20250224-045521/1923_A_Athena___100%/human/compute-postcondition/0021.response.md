Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `n` is equal to `len(a)` and must be greater than 0, `res` is 1, and the current element `a[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `res` has been incremented by 1, so `res` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
