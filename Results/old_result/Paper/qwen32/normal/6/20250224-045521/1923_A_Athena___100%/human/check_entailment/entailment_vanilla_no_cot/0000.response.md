Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single contiguous block. The current implementation simply counts the number of free cells within the range of the first and last chips, which does not account for the need to move chips past other chips to reach the closest free cell to the left.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the number of operations required to move each chip to the closest available position to the left, ensuring that all chips end up in a contiguous block. The current implementation does not handle the movement of chips past other chips or the optimal placement of chips to form a single block.
