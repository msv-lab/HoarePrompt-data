The `pop()` method removes the last element from the list `a`. Given that a `0` was added to the end of `a`, the `pop()` operation will remove this `0`. Therefore, the list `a` will revert to its state before the `0` was added.

Initial State: 
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `n` is the number of elements left in `a` after all leading `0`s are removed and `a` must contain at least one element which is `0`, decreased by 1
- `a` is a list of integers with all leading `0`s removed and a `0` is added to the end of `a`
- `res` is 0

After the `pop()` operation:
- The `0` that was added to the end of `a` is removed, so `a` is now the list with all leading `0`s removed and no additional `0` at the end.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged because `n` is defined as the number of elements left in `a` after all leading `0`s are removed and decreased by 1, and the `pop()` operation only removes the last element which was a `0` added after this count was determined.
- `res` remains 0 as it is not affected by the `pop()` operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is the number of elements left in `a` after all leading `0`s are removed and `a` must contain at least one element which is `0`, decreased by 1; `a` is a list of integers with all leading `0`s removed; `res` is 0.**
