test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each tuple contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the cells, where a_i = 0 means the cell is free and a_i = 1 means the cell contains a chip. In each test case, there is at least one cell that contains a chip. The length of test_cases is between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
