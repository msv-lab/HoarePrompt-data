The code `a.pop(0)` removes the first element from the list `a`. Given that `a[0]` is 0, this element will be removed, and the list `a` will now have `n-2` elements instead of `n-1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `n` is at least 2; `a` is a list of `n-2` integers; `res` is 0**.
