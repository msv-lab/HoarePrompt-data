Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 999, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed, `n` is the integer input by the user, and `res` is 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the list `a` will no longer have any zeros at the beginning. The variables `t`, `n`, and `res` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
