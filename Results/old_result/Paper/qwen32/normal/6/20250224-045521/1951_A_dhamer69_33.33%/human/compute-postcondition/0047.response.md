Postcondition: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 1; `n` is the new input integer; `s` is the new value provided by the user input. If `n` is equal to 2, then `s` remains '00' if it was '00', otherwise, `s` is not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, then `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` and is either odd or even. Additionally, if `n` is not equal to 2, the count of '11' in `s` is either 1 or not equal to 1. Specifically, if `s.count('11')` is 1, the condition is met as stated in the if part. Otherwise, the condition in the else part is met, and the same properties hold.**

This postcondition summarizes that the state of the variables remains consistent with the given conditions regardless of whether the `if` or `else` block is executed.
