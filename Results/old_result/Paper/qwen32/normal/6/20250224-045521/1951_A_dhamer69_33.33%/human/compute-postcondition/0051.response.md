Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` is 0; no further iterations of the loop will occur.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop will no longer execute. The variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
