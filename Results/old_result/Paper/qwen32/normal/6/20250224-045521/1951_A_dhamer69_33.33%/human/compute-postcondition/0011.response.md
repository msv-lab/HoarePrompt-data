The code snippet `count_1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and the precondition that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is not equal to 2, and `s` is the value of the user input remain unchanged. The new variable `count_1` is introduced with a value equal to the number of '1's in `s`.

Output State: **`start` and `end` are non-negative integers such that `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2; `s` is the value of the user input; `count_1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`.**
