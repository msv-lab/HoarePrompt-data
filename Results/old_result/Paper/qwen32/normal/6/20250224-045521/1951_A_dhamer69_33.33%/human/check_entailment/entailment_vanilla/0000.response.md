Reasoning:
The provided program and the problem description do not match. The problem description is about a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` which scans a directory for subdirectories with numeric names within a specified range, finds `.html` files in these subdirectories, and generates corresponding `-ac.py` and `-wa.py` files. However, the provided program is a different function `func` that reads input values and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions related to the count of '1's in a binary string.

Since the provided program does not solve the problem as described and does not implement the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, it is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
