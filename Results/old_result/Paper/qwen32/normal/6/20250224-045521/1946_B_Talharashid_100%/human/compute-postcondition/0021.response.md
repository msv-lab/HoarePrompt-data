The code snippet provided initializes `c` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `ele`, `maxi`) are affected by this operation. The initial conditions for these variables remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, `c` is 0.**
