Postcondition: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and 0.**
