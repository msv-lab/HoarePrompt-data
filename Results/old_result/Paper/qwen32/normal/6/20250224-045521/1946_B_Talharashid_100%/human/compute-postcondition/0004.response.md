The code provided initializes a variable `maxi` to 0. No other variables are modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the input; `c` is 0; `maxi` is 0.**
