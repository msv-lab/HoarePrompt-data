Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input, `l` is a list of integers provided by the input that must have at least one integer, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is updated to be `c + ele`, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
