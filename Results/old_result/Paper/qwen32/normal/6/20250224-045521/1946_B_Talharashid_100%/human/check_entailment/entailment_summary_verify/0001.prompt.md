You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

                maxi = max(c, maxi)

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `a`, adjusted by the value of `k`, and prints the result modulo 1,000,000,007.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Recap
The problem involves performing exactly `k` operations on an array `a` of `n` integers. In each operation, we select any contiguous subarray of `a` (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` such operations, and the result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Insight
The maximum possible sum after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum to the array. This is because adding the maximum subarray sum (which is the largest possible sum of any contiguous subarray) will maximize the total sum of the array. The maximum subarray sum can be found using Kadane's algorithm.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the provided code:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, the length of the array and the number of operations, respectively.
   - It then reads the array `l` of `n` integers.

2. **Finding Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   - The program initializes `c` (current sum) and `maxi` (maximum subarray sum found so far) to 0.
   - It iterates through each element in the array `l`:
     - If the current element `ele` is negative and `c` (current sum) is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, it updates `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and resets `c` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `ele` to `c` and updates `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
   - After the loop, it updates `maxi` one last time to be the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

3. **Calculating the Result:**
   - The program calculates the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - This formula suggests that the maximum subarray sum `maxi` is added `2 ** k - 1` times to the original sum of the array `sum(l)`, and the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues in the Program
The main issue with the program is the formula used to calculate the result. The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` does not correctly represent the process of adding the maximum subarray sum `maxi` exactly `k` times to the array.

- The correct formula should be `(sum(l) + k * maxi) % 1000000007`, which means adding the maximum subarray sum `maxi` exactly `k` times to the original sum of the array `sum(l)`.
- The provided formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` incorrectly suggests that the maximum subarray sum is added `2 ** k - 1` times, which is not what the problem specifies.

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used to calculate the result.

**Correctness: False**
