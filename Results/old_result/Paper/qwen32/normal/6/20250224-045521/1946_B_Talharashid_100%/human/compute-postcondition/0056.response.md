The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 0 and `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, as `i` is the loop variable that gets updated automatically in each iteration of the `for` loop.

State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 1**
