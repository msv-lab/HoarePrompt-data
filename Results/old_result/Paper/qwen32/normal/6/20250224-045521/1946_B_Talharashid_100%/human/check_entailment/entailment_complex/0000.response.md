### Reasoning:

The given problem requires us to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting the sum of that subarray anywhere in the array.

The key insight is that the optimal strategy is to use the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray (`maxi`) and to maximize the number of times this sum is added to the array. The formula used in the code, `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, is intended to capture this idea.

However, there are some issues with the formula:

1. **Exponential Growth**: The term `2 ** k * maxi` suggests that the maximum subarray sum is being added exponentially. This is incorrect because the problem does not specify that the subarray sum can be reused in such a manner. Instead, each operation should ideally add the maximum subarray sum once.

2. **Subtracting `maxi`**: The subtraction of `maxi` from `2 ** k * maxi` does not make sense in the context of the problem. The correct approach would be to add the maximum subarray sum `k` times to the original sum of the array.

3. **Handling Negative Arrays**: The formula does not handle cases where the array is entirely negative correctly. In such cases, the maximum subarray sum would be 0 (an empty subarray), and the result should simply be the sum of the array modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correct Formula:
The correct formula should be:
\[ \text{result} = (\text{sum}(l) + k \times \text{maxi}) \% (10^9 + 7) \]
Where `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the formula used in the code, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
