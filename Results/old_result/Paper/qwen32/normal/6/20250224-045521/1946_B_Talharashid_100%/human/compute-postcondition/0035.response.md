The code snippet `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current values of `c` and `maxi`. Given the initial state where `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0, the value of `maxi` remains 0 after this operation because the maximum of 0 and 0 is 0.

Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `l` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is less than 0, and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.**
