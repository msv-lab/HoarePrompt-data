The code snippet sets `maxi` to 0, which explicitly changes its value. The other variables (`c`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`c` is 0; `maxi` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1; `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input; `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
