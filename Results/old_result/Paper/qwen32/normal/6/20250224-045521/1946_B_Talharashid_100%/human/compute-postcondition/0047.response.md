The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If `l` has more elements, the loop will execute again, and `ele` will be the next element in the list.

Given that `ele` is the next element in the list `l` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least one more element. The state of `ele` will be updated to this next element.

Since the values of `c` and `maxi` are not part of the loop head, we do not adjust them. We only need to ensure that `ele` is set to the next element in the list `l`.

State: **`ele` is the next element in the list `l`**
