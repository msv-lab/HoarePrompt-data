The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `l`. 

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The variables `n` and `k` are provided by the input, but their specific values are not changed by this particular line of code. The new variable `l` is created and populated with integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input; `l` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
