The code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. Given that `c` is 0 and `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`, the value of `maxi` will not change if `maxi` is already greater than or equal to 0. If `maxi` is less than 0, it will be updated to 0.

Since `c` is 0, and `maxi` is defined as the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray, `maxi` will remain unchanged if it is already non-negative. If `maxi` is negative, it will be set to 0.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `l`.**
