The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.

Since the task specifies that we only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`.

State: **`c` is the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers in `l` (or 0 if the last element in `l` is negative and `c` was reset); `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and `c`; `i` is incremented by 1**
