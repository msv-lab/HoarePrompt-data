Postcondition: **`ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of the updated `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.**
