Postcondition: **`v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` if `postorder` was initially empty, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has as many more elements as there are children in `tree.vertices[v].children` if `postorder` was initially empty, the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)` where `u` is the last child of `v` if `postorder` was initially empty, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)` if `postorder` was initially empty, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have been fully processed if `postorder` was initially empty. If `postorder` was not empty, no changes are made to `stack` and the postcondition retains the initial state of `v` and `postorder`.**
