The code snippet reads two integers from the input, representing the number of vertices (`n`) and the number of edges to be removed (`k`). These values replace the previous values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, such that 1 <= k < n.**
