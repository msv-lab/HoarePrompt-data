Postcondition: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute where `tree.vertices[v]` has at least one child; `postorder` is `True`; `stack` remains `[]`; `v` is `s`; `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex; `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component; `u` is the next child in `tree.vertices[s].children` after the current `u`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[s].good_components` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[s].good_components` is updated to `tree.vertices[s].good_components + tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[s].remaining_size` is updated to `tree.vertices[s].remaining_size + tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**
