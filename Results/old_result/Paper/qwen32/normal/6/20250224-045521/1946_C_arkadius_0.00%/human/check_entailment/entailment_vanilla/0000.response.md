To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze each function and the overall logic to ensure it aligns with the problem statement and solves the problem efficiently.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Tree Representation and Initialization**:
   - The program defines a `Tree` class which is not provided in the given code snippet. However, based on the functions, it's clear that the tree is represented with vertices having children and some additional properties like `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
   - The `Tree` class should have methods to add edges and root the tree, which are used in `func_5`.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` both perform DFS on the tree. They are supposed to count the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after considering a certain size `x`.
   - Both functions are essentially equivalent in functionality, iterating over each vertex's children and updating the `good_components` and `remaining_size` based on the condition if the subtree size is at least `x`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` to check if it's possible to split the tree into at least `k` components where each component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It returns `True` if either the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search on the possible values of `x` to find the maximum value such that the condition in `func_3` is satisfied.
   - It initializes `beg` to 1 and `end` to `n`, and iteratively adjusts these based on the results from `func_3`.

5. **Main Function**:
   - `func_5` reads the input for each test case, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x`.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness:

- **Tree Representation**: The program assumes the existence of a `Tree` class with appropriate methods. This is necessary for the program to work, but since the class is not provided, we assume it is correctly implemented.
- **DFS Traversal**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` are correct in their approach to DFS and updating the properties of the tree vertices.
- **Feasibility Check**: `func_3` correctly checks if the tree can be split into the required number of components with at least `x` vertices.
- **Binary Search**: `func_4` correctly uses binary search to find the maximum `x` efficiently.
- **Main Function**: `func_5` correctly reads input, constructs the tree, and outputs the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Given that all components of the program are logically correct and assuming the `Tree` class is correctly implemented, the program should solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
