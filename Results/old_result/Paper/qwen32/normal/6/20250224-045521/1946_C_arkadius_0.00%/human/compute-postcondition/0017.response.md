Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with `n` vertices, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 10^5\), `beg` is either `(beg + end + 1) // 2` or 1 depending on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, `end` is `mid - 1`, `mid` is recalculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to `mid - 1`, while the values of `tree`, `n`, `k`, and `beg` remain unchanged. The variable `mid` will be recalculated based on the new value of `end`.
