The code snippet appends a new tuple `(u, False)` to the `stack` list. This means the `stack` will now have an additional element at the end.

Initial State: 
- `tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute where `tree.vertices[u1].children` must have at least one more element.
- `stack` is `[(s, True), (u1, True), (u, False)]`.
- `v` is `u1`.
- `postorder` is `False`.
- `u` is `u_next`.

After the code executes, the `stack` will be updated to `[(s, True), (u1, True), (u, False), (u, False)]`.

Output State: **`tree` is an object representing a tree structure with a `vertices` attribute where `tree.vertices[u1].children` must have at least one more element; `stack` is `[(s, True), (u1, True), (u, False), (u, False)]`; `v` is `u1`; `postorder` is `False`; `u` is `u_next`.**
