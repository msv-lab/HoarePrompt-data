Functionality: **The function `func_2` evaluates a tree structure to count the number of connected components of at least size `x` starting from a given vertex `v`. It returns two values: `good_components`, which is the total count of such components, and `remaining_size`, which indicates the size of the last component that did not meet the minimum size requirement or is 1 if the last component did meet the requirement.**
