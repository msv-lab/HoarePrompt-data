Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `v` is the last element of `stack` (first element of the tuple), `postorder` is the second element of the last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has one more element than before and the new last element of `stack` is `(v, True)`.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has one more element than before and the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has two more elements than before and the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have more than one element, `u` is the second-to-last element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack`, `postorder` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `stack` before the append, `stack` has three more elements than before, the new last element of `stack` is `(u, False)`, the second-to-last element of `stack` is `(v, postorder)`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have more than one element, `u` is the last element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
