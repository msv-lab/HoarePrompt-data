To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to verify if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here are the key steps and considerations:

1. **Tree Representation**: The program uses a custom `Tree` class to represent the tree structure. This class should allow the addition of edges, rooting of the tree, and the traversal of the tree for analysis.

2. **DFS Traversal**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` perform a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree, given a minimum size `x`. Both functions essentially perform the same task but with different implementations. The logic involves accumulating the sizes of subtrees and counting how many of these subtrees meet the size requirement `x`.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**: The function `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum possible size `x` such that after removing `k` edges, all remaining components have at least `x` vertices. The binary search is conducted between 1 and `n`, and it uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is feasible.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program should correctly handle edge cases, such as when `k` is 1 and the tree is a simple path.

5. **Input Parsing and Output**: The function `func_5` reads input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to determine and print the result.

### Analysis:

- **Tree Construction**: The tree is constructed correctly by adding edges and then rooting it at vertex 0. The rooting process is crucial for ensuring that the DFS traversals are performed correctly.

- **DFS Implementation**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` seem to correctly implement the DFS logic. However, the presence of two similar functions might indicate redundancy unless there is a specific reason for having both. The logic within these functions is consistent with the problem requirements.

- **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_4` is correctly implemented to find the maximum `x`. The search range is appropriate, starting from 1 and going up to `n`. The feasibility check using `func_3` is integrated correctly.

- **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the case where `k` is 1 and the tree is a simple path by correctly calculating the maximum `x`.

- **Input Parsing and Output**: The input parsing and output generation are correctly implemented, ensuring that the program reads the input sets and produces the correct output for each set.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the provided code, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The code handles the tree construction, DFS traversal, binary search for the maximum `x`, and input/output operations correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
