The code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` updates the values of `v` and `u` by calling the function `func_1` with the argument `d`. The function `func_1` is assumed to return a tuple of two values, which are then assigned to `v` and `u` respectively.

Given the initial state, `v` is initially 0, and `u` is initially the value returned by `func_1(d)`. After executing the code snippet, `v` and `u` are re-assigned based on the return values of `func_1(d)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 2; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `path` is a list containing the single element `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n inclusive.**

In simpler terms, after the code execution, `v` and `u` are updated to the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged unless `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.
