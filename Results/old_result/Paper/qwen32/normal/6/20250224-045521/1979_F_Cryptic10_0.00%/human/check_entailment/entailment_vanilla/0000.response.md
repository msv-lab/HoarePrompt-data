Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Graph Description**:
   - We start with a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices.
   - Kostyanych removes exactly `n-2` edges from this graph.
   - This leaves a graph with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges, which is a spanning tree of the original graph. Since a spanning tree with `n` vertices has `n-1` edges, it is guaranteed that there exists a Hamiltonian path in this graph.

2. **Queries**:
   - We can ask queries of the form `"? d"`, where `d` is a degree.
   - The response to this query will be:
     - A vertex `v` with the minimum degree that is at least `d`.
     - A vertex `u` that is not connected to `v` (or `0` if no such vertex exists).
     - The vertex `v` and all edges connected to it are then removed from the graph.
   - If no such vertex `v` exists, the response is `"0 0"`.

3. **Objective**:
   - Find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most `n` queries.
   - Output the path as `"! v1 v2 ... vn"`.

### Program Analysis:

The provided program consists of two functions:
1. **`func_1(d)`**: This function sends a query `"? d"` to the interactor, reads the response, and returns the pair `(v, u)`.
2. **`func_2(n)`**: This function attempts to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph by repeatedly asking queries and building the path.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_2(n)`:

- **Initialization**:
  - `path`: A list that will store the vertices of the Hamiltonian path.
  - `remaining_vertices`: A set containing all vertices from `1` to `n`.

- **Main Loop**:
  - The loop continues until all vertices have been removed from `remaining_vertices`.
  - For each degree `d` from `n-1` down to `0`, a query is made.
  - The response `(v, u)` to the query is checked:
    - If `v` is `0`, it means no vertex with degree at least `d` was found, and the loop continues to the next degree.
    - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it is added to `path`, and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. The loop then breaks to start the next iteration with the updated set of remaining vertices.

- **Output**:
  - Once all vertices are in `path`, the program outputs the Hamiltonian path in the required format.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Degree Queries**: The program queries for vertices with decreasing degrees starting from `n-1`. This ensures that it tries to find vertices with the highest possible degrees first, which is a reasonable strategy for finding a Hamiltonian path.
- **Vertex Removal**: Once a vertex `v` is added to the path, it is removed from the set of remaining vertices, ensuring that each vertex is only added once.
- **Termination**: The loop continues until all vertices are in `path`, and the path is then outputted, which is the correct approach.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to follow a correct strategy for finding a Hamiltonian path using the allowed queries. It ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once and terminates after all vertices have been processed.

**Correctness: True**
