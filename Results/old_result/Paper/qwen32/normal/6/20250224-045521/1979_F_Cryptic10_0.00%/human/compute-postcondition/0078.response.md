The only variable in the loop head is `d`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `d`. At the end of the last iteration, `d` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be decremented by an additional 1 from its current value.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `d` has been decremented by 1.
2. **Adjustment**: To start the next iteration, `d` needs to be decremented by an additional 1.

Since the loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`, and `d` is decremented at the end of each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `d` being one less than its current value.

Thus, if `d` is currently `x`, at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be `x-1`.

State: **`v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `d` is decremented by 1, `path` and `remaining_vertices` are updated based on the new value of `v`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` includes `v` at the end, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the state remains as described without further changes.**
State: **`d` is decremented by 1 from its current value**.

Since we need to specify the exact state, let's denote the current value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration as `x`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be `x-1`.

State: **`d` is `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration**.
