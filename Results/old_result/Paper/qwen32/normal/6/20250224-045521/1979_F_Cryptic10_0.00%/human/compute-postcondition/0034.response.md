Postcondition: **`v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)` and is equal to 0, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` (which is 0), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding the original `v` if `v` has been reassigned to a different value**
