Output State: **`v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding the original `v` if `v` has been reassigned to a different value. Additionally, `v` is in `remaining_vertices`.**

**Natural Language Explanation:** The variable `path` has been updated to include an additional vertex `v`, making it a list `[v, v]`. The values of `v`, `u`, `remaining_vertices`, and the precondition that `v` is in `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
