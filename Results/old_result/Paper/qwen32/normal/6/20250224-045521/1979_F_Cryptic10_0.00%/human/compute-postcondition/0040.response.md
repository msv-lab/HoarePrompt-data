Output State: **`v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. The loop or if statement is broken.**

In simple terms, the values of `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. The only impact is that the loop or if statement is exited.
