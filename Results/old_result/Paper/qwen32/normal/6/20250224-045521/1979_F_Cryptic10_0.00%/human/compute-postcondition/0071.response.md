The code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` updates the values of `v` and `u` based on the function `func_1(d)`. The function `func_1(d)` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact new values of `v` and `u`. However, we can describe the output state based on the changes that occur to `d` and the conditions related to `path` and `remaining_vertices`.

Since `d` is decremented by 1 in the initial state description, we can update `d` accordingly. The values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` depend on whether the original `v` was in `remaining_vertices` or not. However, since `v` and `u` are reassigned by the function call, we need to consider the new value of `v` returned by `func_1(d)`.

Output State: **`v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `d` is decremented by 1, `path` and `remaining_vertices` are updated based on the new value of `v` returned by `func_1(d)`**.

In simpler terms, `v` and `u` get new values from `func_1(d)`, `d` is reduced by 1, and `path` and `remaining_vertices` are adjusted according to whether the new `v` was in `remaining_vertices`.
