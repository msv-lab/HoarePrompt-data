Postcondition: **`v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is `[v, v, v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` (before removal), `path` is `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes all the cases described in the if and else parts, considering the initial state described in the precondition.
