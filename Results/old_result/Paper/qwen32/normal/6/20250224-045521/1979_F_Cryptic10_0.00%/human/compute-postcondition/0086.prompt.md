Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`.
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]`. If `v` is 0, then `path` is specifically `[0, 0]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding 0. Otherwise, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. `n` must be at least 1, and `u` is assigned a value based on the function `func_1(d)`. If `v` was initially in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` becomes `[v, v, v]` and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` was not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `d` is decremented by 1, `path` and `remaining_vertices` are updated based on the new value of `v`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` includes `v` at the end, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the state remains as described without further changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `d` is `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is appended to `path` and `remaining_vertices` no longer contains `v`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to `path` or `remaining_vertices`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
