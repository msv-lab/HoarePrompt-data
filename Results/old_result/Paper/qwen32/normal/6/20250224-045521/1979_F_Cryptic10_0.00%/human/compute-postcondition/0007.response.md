Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive; `d` is n - 1; `v` is 0; `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, then no changes are made to `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `d`, or `u` beyond the initial conditions.**
