The code snippet removes the value `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. The values of `d`, `v`, `u`, and `path` remain unchanged except for `remaining_vertices`, which no longer contains `v`.

Output State: **`d` is `x-1` where `x` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `path` has `v` appended to it; `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`.**
