The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program state. Therefore, none of the variables will be changed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, and it is guaranteed that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `d` is n - 2; `v` is the first value returned by `func_1(d)`; `u` is the second value returned by `func_1(d)`; `path` is a list containing the single element `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, excluding `v` if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to n inclusive.**
