Postcondition: **`v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `d` is decremented by 1, `path` and `remaining_vertices` are updated based on the new value of `v`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` includes `v` at the end, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the state remains as described without further changes.**
