Postcondition: **`path` is a list containing two vertices `[v, v]`. If `v` is 0, then `path` is specifically `[0, 0]` and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding 0. Otherwise, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, excluding `v`. `n` must be at least 1, and `u` is assigned a value based on the function `func_1(d)`. If `v` was initially in `remaining_vertices`, then `path` becomes `[v, v, v]` and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` was not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.**
