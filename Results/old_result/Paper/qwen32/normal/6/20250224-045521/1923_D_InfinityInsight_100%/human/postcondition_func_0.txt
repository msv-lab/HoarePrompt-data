The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `x`. It returns `-1` if `x` is less than 0. If `x` is found in the list `a`, it returns the index of `x` in the list plus one. Otherwise, it returns an index from the list `a` where the value is not equal to `x`, as determined by the function `bl(a, x)`.
