To determine the output state after the execution of the provided code snippet, we need to understand the function `func_1` and how it interacts with the variables `left` and `x`. However, since `func_1` is not defined in the provided context, we will assume that `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments, `left` and `x`, and returns an index based on some criteria.

Given the initial state, the variable `inx` is assigned the result of `func_1(left, x)`. The values of `left`, `x`, and the other variables remain unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `inx`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the assignment to `inx`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[i]` which is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`**.

In simpler terms, the output state is the same as the initial state with the addition of the variable `inx`, which holds the result of the function `func_1(left, x)`.
