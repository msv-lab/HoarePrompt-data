The code snippet appends the value of `i` to the `last` list. Given the initial state, `last` is a list containing two elements `[-1, i]` or `[-1, -1]`. Since `i` is 2, the `last` list will be modified to include `i` as its third element.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `n >= 2`, `left` is a list containing a single element `0`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, `last` is a list containing three elements `[-1, i, i]` or `[-1, -1, i]` where `i` is 2, `i` is 2.**

In simpler terms, the `last` list now contains `[-1, -1, 2]` if the initial `last` was `[-1, -1]`, or `[-1, i, 2]` if the initial `last` was `[-1, i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
