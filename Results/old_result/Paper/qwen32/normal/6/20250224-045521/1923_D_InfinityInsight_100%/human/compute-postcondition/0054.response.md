The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Given that the provided code snippet only contains the `continue` statement, it does not affect any of the variables directly. Therefore, the values of `a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, `last`, `x`, `inx`, `inx2`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `3 - inx` and `ans[3]` which is `1`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`, `i` is 3**.
