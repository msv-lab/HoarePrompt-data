The `continue` statement in the provided code snippet does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in a loop and moves to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to any variables or any other operations performed in the given code snippet, the state of the program remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[i]` which is `1`, and `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed. Additionally, `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`.**
