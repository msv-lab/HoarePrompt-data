The provided code snippet only contains the line `inx = func_1(left, x)`. This line updates the value of `inx` by calling the function `func_1` with `left` and `x` as arguments. However, the function `func_1` is not defined in the given context, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `inx` without knowing what `func_1` does. 

Given the initial state, the only change is the potential update to the variable `inx`. Since the function `func_1` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `inx` after the function call. However, we can describe the state as follows:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `1` if `a[2] < a[1]`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`. If `inx` is less than `0`, the values of `inx` and `inx2` remain unchanged. `i` is 2.**

In natural language: The value of `inx` is updated to the result of the function `func_1(left, x)`. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state.
