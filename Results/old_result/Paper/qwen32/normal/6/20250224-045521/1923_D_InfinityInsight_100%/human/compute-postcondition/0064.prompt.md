Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is the length of `a`, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times, and `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
        ans[i] = 1
        continue
    x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
    inx = func_1(left, x)
    inx2 = last[i - 1]
    if inx2 < inx:
        inx = inx2
    if inx < 0:
        continue
    ans[i] = i + 1 - inx


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[i]` which is `i + 1 - inx` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, and `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is less than `0`, the values of `inx` and `inx2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `3 - inx`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `3 - inx`, and `ans[3]` is `4 - inx`. If `a[3] < a[2]`, then `ans[3]` is `1` and `last[3]` is `3`. Otherwise, `ans[3]` is `4 - inx` and `last[3]` is `last[1]`. `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[2]`, `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
