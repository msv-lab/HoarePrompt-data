The code snippet `inx2 = last[i - 1]` assigns the value of `last[i - 1]` to the variable `inx2`. This means that `inx2` will now hold the same value as the element at index `i - 1` in the `last` list.

Given the initial state, the values of `a`, `n`, `left`, `ans`, `last`, `x`, and `inx` remain unchanged except for the new variable `inx2` which is introduced.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 2, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[i]` which is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element after the first is either the index `i` where a change was observed or the last index where a change was observed, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`.**
