The code snippet `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1` updates the value of `x` based on the current values of `left[i]`, `a[i]`, and `1`. Given that `i` is initially `3`, the new value of `x` will be `left[3] - a[3] - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is at least 4, `left` is a list of cumulative sums starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list of `-1` repeated `n` times except `ans[2]` which is `3 - inx`. If `a[3] < a[2]`, then `ans[3]` is `1` and `last[3]` is `3`. Otherwise, `ans[3]` remains `-1` and `last[3]` is `last[1]`. `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`, `i` is 3.**
