Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If `arr[i]` was equal to `arr[j]` before the if statement, then `i` is 1 and `j` is -1. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
