To ensure that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the state such that the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is true. The provided state indicates that either `i > j` or `arr[i] != arr[j]` is true, and `i` is not greater than `j`. This implies that `arr[i] != arr[j]` must be the case.

To satisfy the loop condition, we need to adjust the values in the array `arr` such that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we can modify the array elements `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`i` and `j` are such that `i` is not greater than `j`, and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`**

This ensures that the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is true, allowing the `while` loop to execute its first iteration.
