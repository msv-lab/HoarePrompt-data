Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
