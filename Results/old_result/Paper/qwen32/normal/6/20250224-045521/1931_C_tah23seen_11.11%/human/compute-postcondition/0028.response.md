The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `i` was incremented by 2, so after this operation, `i` is effectively incremented by 3 from its original value. The values of `j`, `arr[i]`, `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i + 2]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 3, `j` is unchanged, `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `arr[i + 1]` is equal to `arr[i + 2]`.**
