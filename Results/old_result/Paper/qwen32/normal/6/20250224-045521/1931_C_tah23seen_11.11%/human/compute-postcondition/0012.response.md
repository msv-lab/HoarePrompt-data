Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `i` remains 0 and `j` remains `n - 1`, and the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms: The list `arr` and its properties remain unchanged. The variables `i` and `j` are set based on whether the first and last elements of `arr` are equal. The execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
