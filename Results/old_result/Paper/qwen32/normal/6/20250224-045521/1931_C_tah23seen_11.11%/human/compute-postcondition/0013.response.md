Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5. If the first element of `arr` is equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` is 2 and `j` is `n - 3` if the condition `arr[i] == arr[j]` is true, otherwise `i` is 1 and `j` is `n - 2`. If the first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`, then `i` remains 0 and `j` remains `n - 1`.**
