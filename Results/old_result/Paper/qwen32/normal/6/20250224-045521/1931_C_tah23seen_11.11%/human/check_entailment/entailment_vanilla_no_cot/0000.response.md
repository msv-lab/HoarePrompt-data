Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the `func_1` function is incomplete and does not consider all cases for making all elements of the array equal with the minimum cost. Specifically, the function does not explore different values of `x` to determine the optimal range `[i, j]` to replace elements to minimize the cost.

Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. The function only checks if the array can be made equal by potentially replacing elements from the ends towards the center, but it does not consider other possible ranges.
2. It does not account for the possibility of choosing a different value `x` that could result in a lower cost.
3. It does not handle cases where the optimal solution involves replacing elements in the middle of the array or in a different range.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to consider all possible values of `x` and determine the minimum cost for each possible range `[i, j]` that can make the entire array equal to `x`. This can be done using a more comprehensive approach, such as dynamic programming or a sliding window technique, to efficiently find the optimal solution.
