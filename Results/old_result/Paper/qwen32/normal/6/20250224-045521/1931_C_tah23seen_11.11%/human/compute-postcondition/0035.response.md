Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the length of `arr`, denoted as `n`, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns 0 if all elements in `arr` are the same. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from the beginning or ending at the end where all elements are the same. Specifically, it returns `j - i + 1` if there is a position `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` and `j` is the last index of `arr`. If no such `i` exists, it returns the difference between `len(arr) - 1` and the position `i` where the element changes, indicating the length of the contiguous subarray at the end.**
