To determine the necessary adjustments for the first iteration of the `while` loop to proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `i <= j`.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is `n - 1`.

The loop condition is `i <= j`. To ensure the loop executes at least once, this condition must be true right before the loop starts.

Let's analyze the variables `i` and `j`:
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `j` is initialized to `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `i` (which is 0) must be less than or equal to `j` (which is `n - 1`). Since `n` is at least 1, `n - 1` is at least 0. Therefore, `i <= j` will always be true for any valid `n` (where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5).

Thus, no adjustments are needed to the initial states of `i` and `j` for the loop to execute the first time.

The state right before the loop, without any modifications, is sufficient for the loop to execute:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and the length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5; `i` is 0; `j` is `n - 1`**.
