Precondition: **arr is a list of integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the length of arr, denoted as n, satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function is called once for each test case, and the total number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
