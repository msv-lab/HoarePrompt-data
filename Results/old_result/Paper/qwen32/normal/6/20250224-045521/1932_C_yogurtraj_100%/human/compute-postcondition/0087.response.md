The code snippet provided updates the values of `n` and `m` by reading a new pair of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `l`, `y`, `ii`) remain unchanged.

Given the initial state and the code, the new values of `n` and `m` will be the integers obtained from the new input. The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` elements where each element from `n-2` to `0` has been updated to the corresponding value of `k` after all iterations, `ii` is `ii + 1`**.
