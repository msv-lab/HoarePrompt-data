The value of `q1` is updated to `l - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a string (the input value), `n` is the first integer read from input, `m` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `a[l] % m`, `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is 0, and the last character of `t` is not 'L'.
