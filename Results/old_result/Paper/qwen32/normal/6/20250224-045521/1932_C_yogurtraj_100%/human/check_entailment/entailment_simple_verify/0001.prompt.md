You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Analysis

The task involves processing a sequence of commands ('L' and 'R') on an array `a`. For each command, we need to:
1. Output the remainder of the product of all elements in the array `a` modulo `m`.
2. Remove the leftmost element if the command is 'L', or the rightmost element if the command is 'R'.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the provided program step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the values `n` (length of the array) and `m` (modulus) are read.
   - The array `a` is read as a list of integers.
   - The string `t` of commands is read.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `l` is the count of 'L' commands in `t`.
   - `k` is initialized based on whether the last command is 'L' or 'R'. This is intended to be the remainder of the product of the elements that will be left after all commands are processed, but the logic seems incorrect.
   - `q1` and `q2` are initialized to indices that seem to be intended for tracking the elements to be included in the product, but the logic here is flawed.
   - `y` is an array of size `n` initialized to 0, which will store the remainders for each command.

3. **Processing Commands:**
   - The remainder `k` is calculated and stored in `y[-1]` (the last element of `y`).
   - The loop processes the commands in reverse order (from the second last to the first). For each command:
     - If the command is 'R', `k` is updated by multiplying it with the next element to the right (`a[q2]`) and taking modulo `m`.
     - If the command is 'L', `k` is updated by multiplying it with the next element to the left (`a[q1]`) and taking modulo `m`.
     - The updated `k` is stored in the corresponding position in `y`.

### Issues in the Program

- **Initialization of `k`, `q1`, and `q2`:** The initialization logic is incorrect. `k` should be initialized as the product of all elements in `a` modulo `m` at the start. `q1` and `q2` should be initialized to point to the first and last elements of `a`, respectively.
- **Processing Order:** The program processes the commands in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires. It should process them in the order they appear in the string `t`.
- **Updating `k`:** The update logic for `k` is flawed. It should be updated by removing the correct element from the product, not adding the next element.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
