Postcondition: **`t` is a string (the input value), `n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `m` is the second integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is updated based on whether `t[i]` is 'R' or not, `q1` and `q2` are adjusted accordingly, and `y` is a list of `n` zeros with the last element being `k`. Specifically, if `t[i]` is 'R' for some index `i`, then `k` is `(k * a[q2]) % m`, `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `l - 1`, and `q2` is `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `l + 2`. Otherwise, if `t[i]` is not 'R', then `k` is `(a[l - 1] % m * a[q1]) % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `(a[l] % m * a[q1]) % m`, `q1` is `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `l - 2`, and `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' else `l + 1`.**
