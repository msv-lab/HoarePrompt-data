Postcondition: **`t` is the new input string, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a` is the list of integers obtained from the new input, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in `t`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is `a[l] % m`. `q1` is `l - 2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`. `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`. `y` is the list `y` with `n` elements where each element from index `0` to `n-2` is the value of `k` calculated in each iteration, and the last element (index `n-1`) is the initial value of `k`. `ii` is the loop variable `ii` incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
