### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided code to see if it correctly calculates the minimum number of tents needed, given the constraints.

1. **Introverts** (a): Each introvert needs a tent to themselves. Therefore, the number of tents required for introverts is exactly `a`.

2. **Extroverts** (b): Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with exactly two others. Therefore, the number of tents required for extroverts is `ceil(b / 3)`. However, if `b % 3 != 0`, we need to check if we have enough universals to fill up the remaining spots in the tents. If `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means we cannot form a valid group of three with the remaining extroverts and universals, and thus it's impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences.

3. **Universals** (c): Universals can fit into any type of tent, so they can be used to fill up any remaining spots in tents formed by extroverts or to form tents with introverts.

### Code Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**: 
  - This function calculates the number of tents required for the extroverts and any additional universals needed to complete the tents.
  - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to fill the tents. If not, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible.
  - If it's possible, it calculates the total number of tents required using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function uses `func_1` to determine the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
  - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences, so it returns `-1`.
  - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (`introverts`) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total.

### Verification with Test Cases:

Let's verify the code with a few test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 3`
   - `introverts = 1` tent
   - `extroverts = 2`, `universals = 3`: `func_1(2, 3)` returns `ceil((2 + 3) / 3) = 2`
   - Total tents: `1 + 2 = 3`

2. **Test Case 2**: `a = 1`, `b = 4`, `c = 1`
   - `introverts = 1` tent
   - `extroverts = 4`, `universals = 1`: `func_1(4, 1)` returns `None` because `4 % 3 = 1` and `1 + 1 < 3`
   - Total tents: `-1`

3. **Test Case 3**: `a = 1`, `b = 0`, `c = 0`
   - `introverts = 1` tent
   - `extroverts = 0`, `universals = 0`: `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0`
   - Total tents: `1 + 0 = 1`

The code correctly handles these test cases and the logic seems to be sound.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or if it's impossible to accommodate everyone according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
