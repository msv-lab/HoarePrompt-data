Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains elements from `cur_arr` that satisfied the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` up to the point where the if condition was met or after each iteration if the else part is executed, `xor` is a non-zero value such that `xor >> bit & 1` is true if the if condition was met, otherwise `xor` is 0 if the last element caused a reset or the result of the last XOR operation, and `thing1` is -1 if the if condition was met, otherwise `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.**
