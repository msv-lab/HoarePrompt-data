Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is the previous `xor` before XORing with `i`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, `new_arr` has an additional element which is the value of `xor`.**

Natural language explanation: The `new_arr` list now includes an additional element, which is the value of `xor`. All other variables retain their previous values and constraints.
