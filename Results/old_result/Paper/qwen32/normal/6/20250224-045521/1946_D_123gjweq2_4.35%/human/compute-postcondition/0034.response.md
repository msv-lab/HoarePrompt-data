Functionality: **The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (where 0 <= bit < 30) and recursively determines a maximum value based on the specified bit. If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. Otherwise, it partitions `cur_arr` into a new list `new_arr` based on a specific condition related to the `bit`-th bit of the cumulative XOR of elements in `cur_arr`, and then recursively calculates the maximum value between the length of `new_arr` and the result of further recursive calls on `cur_arr` and `new_arr` with `bit - 1`.**
