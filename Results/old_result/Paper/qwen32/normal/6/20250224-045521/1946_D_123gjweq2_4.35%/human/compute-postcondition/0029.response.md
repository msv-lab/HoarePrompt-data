Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains elements from `cur_arr` that satisfied the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` up to the point where the if condition was met or after each iteration if the else part is executed, `xor` is a non-zero value such that `xor >> bit & 1` is true, `thing1` is -1, and `(x >> bit & 1)` is true.**
