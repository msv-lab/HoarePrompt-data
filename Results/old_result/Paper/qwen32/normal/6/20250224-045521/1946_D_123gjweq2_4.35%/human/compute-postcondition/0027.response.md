The code snippet assigns the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` to the variable `thing1`. The values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, and the condition `xor >> bit & 1` being 0 remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains elements from `cur_arr` that satisfied the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` after each iteration, `xor` is 0 if the last element caused a reset, otherwise it is the result of the last XOR operation, `thing1` is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, and `xor >> bit & 1` is 0.**
