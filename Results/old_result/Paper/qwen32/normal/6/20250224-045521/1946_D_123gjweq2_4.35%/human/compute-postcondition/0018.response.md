The code snippet `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` and the value of `i`. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `thing1`) remain unchanged.

Since `xor` is the result of the previous `xor` XOR `i`, and now it is XORed again with the same `i`, the new value of `xor` will effectively undo the previous XOR operation with `i`. This means that if `xor` was previously `prev_xor ^ i`, after executing `xor ^= i`, `xor` will be `prev_xor`.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is the previous `xor` before XORing with `i`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
