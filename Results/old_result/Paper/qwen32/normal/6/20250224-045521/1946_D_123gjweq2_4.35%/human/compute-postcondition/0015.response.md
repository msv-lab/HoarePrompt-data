Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, and `new_arr` is a list that now contains the previous elements (if any) and the new element `xor`. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**

In this output state, the variable `xor` has been reset to 0. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
