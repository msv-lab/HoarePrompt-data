You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments (k) in an array such that:
1. The first segment starts at index 1.
2. The last segment ends at index n.
3. Each segment is contiguous, i.e., if the current segment ends at index `r`, the next segment must start at index `r + 1`.
4. The bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment should be less than or equal to a given number `x`.

### Program Analysis

The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(arr, x)`: This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
2. `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`: This is a recursive function that tries to split the array based on the current bit and recursively solves the problem for the next bit.

#### Function `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`

- **Base Case**: If `bit == -1`, it means all bits have been processed, and the function returns the length of the current array, indicating that the array can be split into segments without violating the bitwise OR constraint.
- **Recursive Case**:
  - It initializes `xor` to 0 and `new_arr` to an empty list.
  - It iterates through the array, computing the cumulative XOR (`xor ^= i`) for each element.
  - If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0 (`if not xor >> bit & 1`), it appends the current `xor` to `new_arr` and resets `xor` to 0.
  - After the loop, if the `bit`-th bit of the final `xor` is 1, it sets `thing1` to -1, indicating that it's not possible to split the array at this bit without violating the constraint.
  - Otherwise, it recursively calls `find_max` with `new_arr` and `bit - 1` and assigns the result to `thing1`.
  - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is 1 (`if x >> bit & 1`), it returns the maximum of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
  - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is 0, it returns `thing1`.

### Issues in the Program

The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the bitwise OR of the bitwise XOR of each segment is less than or equal to `x`. The program attempts to split the array based on the bits of `xor` and `x`, but it does not correctly handle the cumulative OR constraint across the segments.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to ensure that the cumulative OR of the XOR values of the segments is within the limit `x`.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
