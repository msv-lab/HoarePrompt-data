Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cur_arr:
    xor ^= i
    if not xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
        xor = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is either `i` or 0, `thing1` is 0, and if the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing `i`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is the result of the previous `xor` XOR `i`, `thing1` is 0. If the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the previous elements (if any) and the new element `xor`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains an empty list. `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is 0 if the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` was true, otherwise `xor` retains its original value, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`. If the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` was true, `new_arr` has an additional element which is the value of `xor` before it was set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
