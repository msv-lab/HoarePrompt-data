Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `xor` is 0 if the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` was true, otherwise `xor` retains its original value, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`. If the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` was true, `new_arr` has an additional element which is the value of `xor` before it was set to 0.**
