The code snippet assigns the value `-1` to the variable `thing1`. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, and `thing1`'s previous value) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains elements from `cur_arr` that satisfied the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` up to the point where the if condition was met, `xor` is a non-zero value such that `xor >> bit & 1` is true, indicating the last element caused the if condition to be met, `thing1` is -1.**
