Postcondition: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains elements from `cur_arr` that satisfied the condition `not xor >> bit & 1` after each iteration, `xor` is 0 if the last element caused a reset, otherwise it is the result of the last XOR operation, `thing1` is unchanged, and `xor >> bit & 1` is 0**
