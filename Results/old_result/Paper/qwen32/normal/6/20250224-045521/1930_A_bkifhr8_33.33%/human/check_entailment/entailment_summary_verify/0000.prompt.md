You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from the list until only two or fewer integers remain. The function outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to achieve the maximum final score. Specifically, the program does not sort the list of integers before processing them, which is crucial for maximizing the score. The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integers together because adding the minimum of each pair will yield the highest possible score.

Here is a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Sorting the List**: The program should first sort the list of integers. This ensures that the smallest integers are paired together, maximizing the sum of the minimums.

2. **Incorrect Pairing Logic**: The current logic for pairing integers is incorrect. The program attempts to remove elements from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which is not the correct way to access and remove elements from the list. Also, the loop condition and the logic for removing elements are flawed.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2` is incorrect. The loop should continue until all elements are paired, and the logic for pairing and removing elements should be corrected.

### Correct Approach:
- Sort the list of integers.
- Iterate through the sorted list, taking pairs of elements (i.e., elements at even and odd indices).
- Add the minimum of each pair to the score (which will be the first element of each pair in the sorted list).
- Continue this process until all pairs are processed.

### Example of a Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Example Case Where Provided Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
2
3 1 2 4
```
- The provided program might incorrectly pair 3 and 1, then 2 and 4, resulting in a score of 1 + 2 = 3.
- The correct approach would sort the list to [1, 2, 3, 4] and pair 1 and 2, then 3 and 4, resulting in a score of 1 + 3 = 4.

Thus, the provided program is incorrect.
