Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, and the precondition for the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) is still valid; `ans_f` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    ans = 0
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = l.split(' ')
    for i in range(n * 2):
        if len(lst) != 2:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
            lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
        else:
            ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
            break
    ans_f.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is n * 2 - 1 or a smaller value if the loop breaks early; `ans` is the sum of the minimums of each pair of elements processed from `lst`; `n` is an input integer; `l` is an input string; `lst` is either empty or contains exactly two elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is the number of iterations the loop completed; `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of elements processed; `n` is the newly input integer; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is either empty or contains exactly two elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the final value of `ans` plus the current value of `ans`; `i` is `n * 2 + 1` if the loop completes all iterations or the iteration number when the loop breaks if `lst` becomes exactly 2 elements; `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` until `lst` is reduced to 2 elements or fewer; `n` is the number of pairs processed; `l` is the input string; `lst` is either empty or has 2 elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
