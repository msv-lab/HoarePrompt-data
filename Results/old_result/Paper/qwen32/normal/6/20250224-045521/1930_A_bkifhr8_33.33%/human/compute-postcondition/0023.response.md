The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n * 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0. Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2. The value of `n` does not change; it remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is 2; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space. If the original length of `lst` was not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 are removed from `lst`, causing a shift in the subsequent elements. If the original length of `lst` was exactly 2, no elements are removed from `lst`.**
