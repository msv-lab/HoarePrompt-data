The code snippet `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the string `l` into a list of substrings wherever there is a space. This means `lst` will now contain the elements of the string `l` that were separated by spaces.

Given the initial state, `lst` is either empty or contains exactly two elements. After the execution of the code, `lst` will be a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces. The values of `t`, `ans_f`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans_f` is a list containing the value of `ans`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `ans` is 0; `n` is the newly input integer; `l` is the newly input string; `lst` is a list of substrings from `l` split by spaces.**
