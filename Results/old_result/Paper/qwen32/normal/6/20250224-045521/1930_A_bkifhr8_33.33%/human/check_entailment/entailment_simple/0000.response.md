### Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to solve the problem of finding the maximum score by optimally pairing numbers and adding the minimum of each pair to the score. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect results.

1. **Incorrect Pair Removal:** The code attempts to remove elements from the list using incorrect indices. The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are problematic because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always evaluate to `0` and `2` respectively, leading to incorrect element removal and potential `IndexError`.

2. **Logic for Pairing:** The program does not correctly handle the pairing logic. It should sort the list and then sum the minimum of each pair, which would be the first element of each pair in the sorted list. The current implementation does not sort the list and instead attempts to remove elements in a manner that does not guarantee the correct pairs are selected.

3. **Loop Condition:** The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not correctly structured to handle the pairing process. The loop should continue until all pairs are processed, not just until the list has two elements left.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the program, we need to:
- Sort the list of numbers.
- Pair the numbers from the smallest to the largest.
- Sum the minimum of each pair, which will be the first element of each pair in the sorted list.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        
        n = int(input())
        
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        lst.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            ans += lst[i]
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
        
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to improper handling of list elements and incorrect pairing logic.

**Correctness: False**
