Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is not yet initialized; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space, with the first element removed. The length of `lst` is not equal to 2, but it has one less element than before.**

Explanation: The first element of `lst` has been removed, so the list now contains one less element than it did initially. The other variables remain unchanged.
