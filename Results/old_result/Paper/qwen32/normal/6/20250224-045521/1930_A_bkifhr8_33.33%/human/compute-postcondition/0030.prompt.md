Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is not yet initialized; `ans` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is not yet initialized; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 are removed from `lst`, causing a shift in the subsequent elements. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, no elements are removed from `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is 1; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space. If the original length of `lst` was not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 are removed from `lst`, causing a shift in the subsequent elements. If the original length of `lst` was exactly 2, no elements are removed from `lst`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `ans_f` is an empty list; `i` is 2; `ans` is the sum of its previous value and the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0; `l` is an input string; `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting `l` at each space. If the original length of `lst` was not 2, the first element and the element at index 2 are removed from `lst`, reducing its length by 3. If the original length of `lst` was exactly 2, no elements are removed from `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
