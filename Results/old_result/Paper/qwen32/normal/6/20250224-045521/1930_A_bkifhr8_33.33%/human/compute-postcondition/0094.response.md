To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Analysis:
1. **`t`**: This is the number of test cases, with \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
2. **`ans_f`**: This is a list containing the final values of `ans` for each test case. It must have at least one element.
3. **`i`**: This variable can take two possible values:
   - `n * 2 + 1` if the loop completes all iterations.
   - The iteration number when the loop breaks if `lst` becomes exactly 2 elements.
4. **`ans`**: This is the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` until `lst` is reduced to 2 elements or fewer.
5. **`n`**: This is the number of pairs processed.
6. **`l`**: This is the input string.
7. **`lst`**: This is either empty or has 2 elements.

### Key Points:
- The variable `i` is the main focus. Its value depends on whether the loop completes all iterations or breaks early.
- If the loop completes all iterations, `i` is set to `n * 2 + 1`.
- If the loop breaks early, `i` is set to the iteration number when `lst` becomes exactly 2 elements.

### Determining the Output:
Given the information, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `i` without knowing the specific values of `n` and the exact behavior of the loop (whether it completes all iterations or breaks early). However, we know the conditions under which `i` takes its values.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i` which depends on the loop's behavior. If the loop completes all iterations, `i` will be `n * 2 + 1`. If the loop breaks early, `i` will be the iteration number when `lst` becomes exactly 2 elements.

Output: **i (where i is n * 2 + 1 if the loop completes all iterations, or the iteration number when lst becomes exactly 2 elements if the loop breaks early)**
