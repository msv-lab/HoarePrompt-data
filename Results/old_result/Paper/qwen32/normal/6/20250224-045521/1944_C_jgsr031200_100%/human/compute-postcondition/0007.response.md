Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, and `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, except each `freq[j]` reflects the number of times the integer `j` appears in `arr`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing for all elements in `arr`, the `freq` list will contain the count of how many times each integer from 0 to n-1 appears in the `arr` list. Each index `j` in `freq` will hold the count of occurrences of the integer `j` in `arr`.
