Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `cou` is either 0 or 1. If `freq[i] >= 2`, there is no change to `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`. If `freq[i] < 2`, there is no change to `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`. If `cou == 2` or `freq[i] == 0`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change to `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`.**
