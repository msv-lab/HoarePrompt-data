Let's break down the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
- **Alice and Bob** are playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- They take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or simply deleting them (Bob).
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- The score of the game is the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.
- Alice aims to maximize the score, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- We need to find the final score if both play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**: Alice and Bob are playing optimally. For Alice to maximize the MEX, she should try to delay the inclusion of the smallest possible numbers in `c`. Bob, on the other hand, should try to include the smallest possible numbers in `c` to minimize the MEX.
3. **Turns**: Alice starts, and they alternate turns. Since Alice goes first and they both play optimally, Alice can ensure that she doesn't include a number if it can be avoided, while Bob will try to include the smallest numbers to minimize the MEX.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Frequency Calculation**: The program calculates the frequency of each element in the array `a` and stores it in `freq`.
2. **Counting Unique Elements**: It then counts how many unique elements (elements with frequency 1) are encountered.
3. **Finding the MEX**: It iterates through the possible numbers from 0 to `n` and:
   - Skips numbers with a frequency of 2 or more.
   - Counts numbers with a frequency of 1.
   - Stops at the first number with a frequency of 0 or when the count of unique numbers reaches 2, and prints that number as the MEX.

### Correctness:
- **Frequency Calculation**: This part is correct. It correctly counts the occurrences of each number in the array.
- **MEX Calculation**: The logic for calculating the MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the game's optimal play. It does not account for the alternating turns and the strategic decisions made by Alice and Bob.
- **Optimal Play Simulation**: The program does not simulate the actual game where Alice and Bob make strategic moves. It simply counts the frequency and stops at the first number with a frequency of 0 or when the count of unique numbers reaches 2, which does not necessarily reflect the optimal play.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of Alice and Bob and thus does not correctly determine the final MEX score.

**Correctness: False**
