### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary in the context of the problem description.

#### Problem Breakdown:
The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to modify an array `a` and an array `c`. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The key is to simulate the turns and determine the final MEX of `c` after all elements from `a` are used up.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided code includes a function `func_1` which calculates the frequency of each element in the array `arr` and then determines the smallest integer between 0 and `n` that appears at most once in `arr` or is missing from `arr`. This seems to be an attempt to find the MEX, but it does not simulate the turns between Alice and Bob.

#### Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` prints the smallest integer between 0 and `n` that appears at most once in `arr` or is missing from `arr`. This aligns with the calculation of MEX if the game were played optimally and all elements were considered.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Lack of Turn Simulation**: The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly computes the MEX based on the frequency of elements in `arr`.
2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The provided logic for finding the MEX does not account for the strategic moves of Alice and Bob. It simply finds the smallest missing or infrequent element without simulating the game process.

#### Example Analysis:
For the input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```
The correct output should be `2`, as the optimal game play would result in `c` being `[1, 0]` (or any permutation thereof), leading to a MEX of `2`.

However, the provided code outputs `0` because it does not simulate the game turns and directly finds the smallest missing or infrequent element.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game turns and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
