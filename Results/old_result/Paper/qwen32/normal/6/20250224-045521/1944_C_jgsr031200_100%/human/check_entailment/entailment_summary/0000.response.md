### Reasoning:

The given problem requires determining the MEX (minimum excludant) of an array `c` constructed by Alice and Bob playing optimally on an array `a`. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

The provided program calculates the frequency of each element in the array `arr` (which corresponds to the array `a` in the problem statement) and then finds the smallest integer that either appears at most once or is missing from the array. This approach is correct because:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX. She will try to add elements to `c` that are not yet in `c` or appear only once in `arr` to ensure the MEX is higher.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX. He will try to remove elements that Alice might add to `c` to keep the MEX lower. However, since Alice goes first and can strategically pick elements, Bob's moves will not affect the final MEX if Alice plays optimally.

The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that either appears at most once or is missing from `arr`. This integer will be the MEX of the array `c` after all elements have been processed, assuming both players play optimally.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
