Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c` (Alice) or just removing them (Bob).
- The game ends when `a` is empty.
- Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it.
- We need to find the final MEX of `c` if both players play optimally.

### Key Observations:
1. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Optimal Play**: Alice wants to place numbers in `c` in such a way that the MEX is maximized. Bob wants to prevent this by removing numbers that could help Alice.
3. **Frequency Analysis**: The frequency of each number in `a` is crucial. If a number appears at least twice, it can be used by Alice to maximize the MEX. If a number appears exactly once, it might be strategically placed by Alice to maximize the MEX. If a number does not appear at all, it can be the MEX.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the MEX of the array `a` under optimal play conditions.

Here's the breakdown of the program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: It calculates the frequency of each number in `a` using a list `freq` of size `n+1`.
3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - It iterates over the `freq` list.
   - It skips numbers that appear at least twice.
   - It counts numbers that appear exactly once.
   - When it encounters a number that appears exactly once or a number that does not appear at all, it prints that number and breaks out of the loop.

### Correctness:
The program logic is correct based on the problem's requirements. Here's why:
- **Frequency Analysis**: The program correctly calculates the frequency of each number in `a`.
- **MEX Calculation**: The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `a` or appears only once, which aligns with the optimal play strategy described.

### Conclusion:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly computes the final MEX of `c` for each test case under optimal play conditions.

**Correctness: True**
