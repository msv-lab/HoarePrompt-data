The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `arr`, `freq`, `cou`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, `freq[i]` is at least 2, `cou` is 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `freq[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
