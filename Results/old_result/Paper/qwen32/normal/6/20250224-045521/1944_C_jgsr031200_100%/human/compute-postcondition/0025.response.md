Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`.
2. The length of `arr` is `n`, where `n` is at least 1.
3. `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`.
4. `i` is 1.
5. `cou` is either 0, 1, or 2.
6. If `freq[i] == 1`, there is no change to `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`.
7. If `freq[i] != 1`, there is no change to `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`.
8. If `cou == 2` or `freq[i] == 0`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change to `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
- The `freq` list is initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, so `freq[1]` is 0.
- According to the initial state, if `freq[i] == 0`, the loop or if statement is broken out of. Since `freq[1]` is 0, this condition would be met, but it doesn't affect the value of `i` before the print statement.
- The print statement is outside of any loop or conditional block that could change the value of `i`, so `i` remains 1.

### Conclusion:
The print statement will output the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
