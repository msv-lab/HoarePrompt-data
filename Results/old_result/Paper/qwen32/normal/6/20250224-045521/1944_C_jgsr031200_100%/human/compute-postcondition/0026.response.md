Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 <= a_i < n`, the length of `arr` is `n` where `n` is at least 1, `freq` is a list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 1, `cou` is either 0 or 1 or 2, and the loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the loop or if statement to terminate without changing the values of `arr`, `freq`, `i`, or `cou`. The condition checks for `cou == 2` or `freq[i] == 0` to break out of the loop or if statement, and since the `break` statement is executed, the loop or if statement is indeed broken out of.
