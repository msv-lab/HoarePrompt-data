Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`arr`**: A list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 0 \leq a_i < n \). The length of `arr` is `n`, where `n` is at least 1.
2. **`freq`**: A list of integers initialized to 0 with a length of `n + 1`.
3. **`i`**: Initialized to 0.
4. **`cou`**: Not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but based on the if statement, we can infer its behavior. If `freq[i]` was 1 before the if statement, then `cou` is set to 1 and `freq[i]` remains 1. Otherwise, `cou` remains 0.
5. **If Condition**: The condition `(cou == 2 or freq[i] == 0)` is true, meaning either `cou` is 2 or `freq[i]` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- `i` is explicitly initialized to 0.
- The if condition does not change the value of `i`. It only affects `cou` and `freq[i]` based on certain conditions.
- Since the print statement is `print(i)`, and `i` is initialized to 0 and not modified anywhere in the given code snippet, the output will simply be the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The value of `i` is 0, and it is not modified by any operations in the provided code snippet.

Output: **0**
