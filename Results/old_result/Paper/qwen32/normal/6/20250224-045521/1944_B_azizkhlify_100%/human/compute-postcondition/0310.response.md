Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `ur` is `ur + 2` if `r[a[n + 1] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ur` is unchanged, `ul` is unchanged, and `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is 0 if `r[a[n + 1] - 1] == 2`. If `ul` equals `ur`, the program state remains as described. If `ul` does not equal `ur`, the program state also remains as described.**
