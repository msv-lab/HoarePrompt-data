To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and analyze the relevant variables:

1. **Variables and Lists**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000.
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `k` is defined by the formula `k = 2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` is a list where each element at index `j` represents the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` was `2` during the loop, it is set to `0`.
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` represents the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
   - `re` is initialized to 0.
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends or `k * 2` if it breaks early.
   - `ur` is initialized to 0.
   - `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended (either `n-1` or the value when `ul` reached `k * 2`).
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1.

2. **Critical Observations**:
   - The loop modifies `l` based on the counts of elements in `a`.
   - The loop continues until either `ul` reaches `k * 2` or `i` reaches `n-1`.
   - At the end of the loop, `l[a[i] - 1]` is set to 1, which means the element `a[i]` appears exactly once in `a`.

3. **Output Analysis**:
   - The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[i]` followed by a space.
   - From the precondition, we know that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, which means `a[i]` appears exactly once in the list `a`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be the value of `a[i]` as it is the only information we have about the specific value of `a[i]` from the precondition.

Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a that appears exactly once)**
