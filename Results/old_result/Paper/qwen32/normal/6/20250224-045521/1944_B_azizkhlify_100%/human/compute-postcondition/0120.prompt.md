Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers read from the input; All elements in `res` are printed, separated by spaces. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then all elements in `res` that meet the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` are printed twice, separated by spaces, and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each such element. `ul` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, no additional elements are printed and `ur` remains unchanged. `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. `l` is a list of `n` zeros. `r` is a list of `n` zeros. `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0. `res` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    l[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[i] - 1]` which is 2, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list of `n` zeros except `l[a[1] - 1]` which is 3, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
