To determine what will be printed when the `print(i, end=' ')` statement is executed, we need to consider the given initial state and the context of the variables. Here's the breakdown:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `k`, `a`, `l`, `r` remain the same throughout the context.
- `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends.
- `ur` remains `0`.
- `res` contains at least one element.

However, the variable `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the provided initial state. Given the context of typical programming problems, `i` is often used as a loop counter. Therefore, we can infer that `i` is likely a loop variable that changes with each iteration of a loop.

Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we must assume that its value is determined by the loop in which it is used. The `print(i, end=' ')` statement suggests that `i` is being printed in each iteration of a loop, and the `end=' '` argument indicates that the output will be separated by spaces rather than newlines.

Without the exact loop structure, we cannot determine the specific values of `i` that will be printed. However, we can provide a general description of what will be printed based on the typical use of `i` in loops.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Loop Counter `i`**: `i` is a loop counter that typically iterates over a range of values. Since the exact range is not provided, we can assume it could be a range from 0 to `n-1`, 1 to `n`, or any other defined range.
2. **Print Statement**: The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the current value of `i` in each iteration of the loop, with a space separating each value.

### Example Scenario:
If `i` iterates from 0 to `n-1`, the output would be the sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, separated by spaces.

### General Output:
Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state and could vary based on the loop structure, the most precise description we can provide is that `i` will be printed in each iteration of the loop, separated by spaces.

Output: **i (where i is the loop counter value in each iteration of the loop, separated by spaces)**
