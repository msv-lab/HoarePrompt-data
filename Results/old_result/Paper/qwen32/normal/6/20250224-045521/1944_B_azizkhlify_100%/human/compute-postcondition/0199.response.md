The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the element at the index `a[i] - 1` of the list `r` to 0. The values of `n` and `i` are not directly affected by this operation, but the value of the specific element in `r` is changed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is set to 0.**
