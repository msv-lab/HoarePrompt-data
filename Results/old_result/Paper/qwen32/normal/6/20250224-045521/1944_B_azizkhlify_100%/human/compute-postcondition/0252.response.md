To determine the output of the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and understand the values of the variables `a[i]` and `i`.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`n`**: Must be greater than 0.
2. **`k`**: The second integer from the input.
3. **`ul`**: Either `k * 2 + 2` if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ul` is `k * 2` or 0.
4. **`ur`**: Always 0.
5. **`res`**: An empty list.
6. **`a`**: A list of integers obtained from the input.
7. **`l`**: A list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in the list `a` except `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0 if `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
8. **`r`**: A list of `n` zeros except that the element at index `a[n] - 1` is `n`, the element at index `a[n + 1] - 1` is `n-1`, ..., the element at index `a[2*n-1] - 1` is 1.
9. **`i`**: Initialized to 1.
10. **`re`**: Initialized to 0.

### The `print` Statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- **`i`**: Initially set to 1.
- **`a`**: A list of integers. We don't know the exact list, but we know it has at least `n` elements since `r` is constructed based on `2*n-1` elements from `a`.

### Determining the Output:
- The `print` statement prints `a[i]` twice, with a space separating them, and no newline character at the end (due to `end=' '`).
- Since `i` is 1, the statement will print the element at index 1 of the list `a` twice.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the element at index 1 of the list `a`, printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
