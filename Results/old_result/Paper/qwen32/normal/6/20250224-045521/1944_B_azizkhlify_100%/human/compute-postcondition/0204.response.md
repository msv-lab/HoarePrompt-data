The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop runs from `i` starting at `n` up to, but not including, `2 * n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be the incremented value from the previous iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations.

So, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was some value, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous iteration. The value of `n` will still be the same.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**. 

To be more specific, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize it as above. However, if we consider the immediate next iteration directly after the provided state, we can say:

If `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration (the first iteration), then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1`**.
