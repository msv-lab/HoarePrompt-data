The code snippet `ur += 2` increments the variable `ur` by 2. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `r`) are not affected by this code snippet. 

Given the initial state, `n` is still greater than or equal to 0, `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, and the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` has been set to 0. The only change is the value of `ur`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value; the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `r` is set to 0; `ur` is increased by 2.**
