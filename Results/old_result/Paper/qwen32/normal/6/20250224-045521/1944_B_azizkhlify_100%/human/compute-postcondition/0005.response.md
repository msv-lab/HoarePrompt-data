The given code snippet initializes three new variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to 0. The initial state mentions that `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` are already defined and their values are not changed by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list of `n` zeros; `r` is a list of `n` zeros; `re` is 0; `ul` is 0; `ur` is 0.**
