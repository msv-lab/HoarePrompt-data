The value of `ul` is incremented by 2. The other variables (`n`, `l`, and `a[i]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, and `ul` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, `ul` is increased by 2**.
