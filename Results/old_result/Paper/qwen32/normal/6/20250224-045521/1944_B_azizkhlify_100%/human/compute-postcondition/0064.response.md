To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the behavior of the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`, with elements set to `0` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was `2` during the loop.
- `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
- If `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` is updated to contain the single element `a[i]`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.
- `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends or `k * 2` if it breaks early.
- `ur` is 0.
- `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended plus 2.

### Analysis of `print(a[i], end=' ')`:
The statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index `i` in the list `a`, followed by a space.

From the initial state, we know that `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended plus 2. However, the exact value of `i` is not explicitly given, and it depends on the behavior of the loop, which is not detailed in the initial state.

Given the information, we can infer the following:
- The value of `i` is determined by the loop's execution.
- Once the loop ends, `i` is set to the last index it processed plus 2.

Since the exact behavior of the loop and the value of `i` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `i` and the list `a`.

### Output Description:
The code will print the element at index `i` in the list `a`, where `i` is the last index processed by the loop plus 2.

Output: **a[i] (where i is the last index processed by the loop plus 2)**
