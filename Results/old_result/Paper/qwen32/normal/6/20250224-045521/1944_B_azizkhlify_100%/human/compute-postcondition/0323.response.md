Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an array `a` of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs of integers from the left half of the array that appear exactly twice, up to `k` pairs. If fewer than `k` pairs are found, it prints single integers from the left half that appear exactly once until the total count of printed numbers reaches `2k`. If the number of printed pairs from the left half does not match the number of printed pairs from the right half, it prints pairs from the right half that appear exactly twice until the counts match.**
