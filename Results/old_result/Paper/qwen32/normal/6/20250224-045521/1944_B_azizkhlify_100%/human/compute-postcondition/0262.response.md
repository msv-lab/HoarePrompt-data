Postcondition: **`ul` is either `k * 2` if the loop breaks early or the sum of all increments of 2 that occurred during the iterations if the loop completes all `n` iterations, `ur` remains 0, `res` remains an empty list, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is 0, `re` remains 0, `k` is not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1**
