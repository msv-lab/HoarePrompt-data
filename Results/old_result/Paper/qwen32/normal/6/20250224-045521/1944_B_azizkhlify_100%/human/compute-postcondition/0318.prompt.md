Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ul` is the sum of all increments of 2 that occurred during the iterations, `ur` is 0, `res` remains unchanged, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, `i` is the last element in `res`, `re` is the count of elements in `res`, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `ur` is unchanged, and `ul` is unchanged. If `ul` equals `ur`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `ur` is `ur + 2` if `r[a[n + 1] - 1] == 2`, otherwise `ur` is unchanged, `ul` is unchanged, and `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is 0 if `r[a[n + 1] - 1] == 2`. If `ul` equals `ur`, the program state remains as described. If `ul` does not equal `ur`, the program state also remains as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n + 2`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then the values of `r` and `ur` remain unchanged based on the initial condition. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without altering `r` and `ur`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
