Output State: **`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a list where `l[j]` is the count of how many times `j+1` appears in `a`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros except `r[a[n] - 1]` which is incremented by 1, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is also incremented by 1, `r[a[n + 2] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 2`**

Explanation: The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is `n + 2`. Therefore, `r[a[n + 2] - 1]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
