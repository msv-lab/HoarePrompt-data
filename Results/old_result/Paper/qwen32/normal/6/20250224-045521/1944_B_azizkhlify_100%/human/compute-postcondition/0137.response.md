The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. The state of `ul` and `k` do not affect the loop's continuation, so they do not need to be adjusted in the loop head.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
