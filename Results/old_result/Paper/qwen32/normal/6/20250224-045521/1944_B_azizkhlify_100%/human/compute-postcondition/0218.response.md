The code snippet `r = [0] * n` assigns a new list to the variable `r`, where the list contains `n` zeros. The values of `n`, `k`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`, `a`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input, `k` is the second integer from the input, `ul` remains unchanged, `ur` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `i` remains unchanged.**
