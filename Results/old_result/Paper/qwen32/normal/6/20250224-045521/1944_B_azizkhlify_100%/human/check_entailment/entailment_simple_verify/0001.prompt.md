You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to keep track of the counts of each number in the first half and the second half of `a`, respectively.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are initialized to keep track of remaining elements, elements used in `l`, and elements used in `r`, respectively.
   - An array `res` is used to store elements temporarily.

3. **Counting Elements:**
   - The first loop counts the occurrences of each number in the first half of `a` and stores them in `l`.
   - The second loop counts the occurrences of each number in the second half of `a` and stores them in `r`.

4. **Constructing `l`:**
   - The third loop iterates over the first half of `a` and adds pairs of elements that appear twice to `l` until `l` has `2k` elements.
   - If `l` already has `2k` elements after processing all pairs, it breaks out of the loop.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - If `l` does not have `2k` elements after processing pairs, the code adds single elements from the first half of `a` to `l` until it has `2k` elements.
   - The elements added to `l` are also stored in `res`.

6. **Printing `l`:**
   - The code prints the elements of `l`.

7. **Constructing `r`:**
   - The code then prints the elements stored in `res` as part of `r`.
   - If the number of elements used in `l` (`ul`) is not equal to the number of elements used in `r` (`ur`), the code adds pairs of elements from the second half of `a` to `r` until `ur` equals `ul`.

8. **Printing `r`:**
   - The code prints the elements of `r`.

### Analysis of the Code:

- The code attempts to construct `l` and `r` by ensuring that each array has `2k` elements.
- It correctly handles the case where elements appear twice by adding pairs to `l` first.
- It also correctly handles the case where elements appear only once by adding them to `l` until it has `2k` elements.
- The code ensures that `l` and `r` have the same number of elements by adding pairs to `r` if necessary.
- However, the code does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`.

### Key Issue:

The critical issue with the code is that it does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`. The code simply constructs `l` and `r` by counting elements and adding them to the arrays without considering the XOR condition.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem's requirement that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` must be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `r`, the provided code is incorrect.
