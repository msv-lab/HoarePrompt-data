Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` must be a non-negative integer.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

### Code to Analyze:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is set to `n`. So, `i` has the same value as `n`.

2. **Understanding `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2:**
   - This condition tells us that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is equal to 2.
   - Since `i` is `n`, this can be rewritten as `r[a[n] - 1]` equals 2.

3. **What is printed:**
   - The `print` statement prints `a[i]` twice, separated by a space, and does not end the line after printing.
   - Since `i` is `n`, this means it prints `a[n]` twice.

### Conclusion:
- The value printed is `a[n]` followed by `a[n]` again, separated by a space, and the line is not ended after printing.

### Output:
Output: **a[n] a[n]**
