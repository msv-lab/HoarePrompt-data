Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is an integer obtained from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `l[a[i] - 1]` is now 0, `ul` is 2, and `ur` is 0; otherwise, `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged, `ul` is 0, and `ur` is 0. `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `i` is 0.**
