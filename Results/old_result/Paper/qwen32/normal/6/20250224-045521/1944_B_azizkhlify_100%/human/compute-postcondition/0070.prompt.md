Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`, with elements set to `0` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was `2` during the loop; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 0; `res` is an empty list; `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends or `k * 2` if it breaks early; `ur` is 0; `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended (either `n-1` or the value when `ul` reached `k * 2`).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`, with elements set to `0` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was `2` during the loop; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `re` remains 0; `res` is a list containing the single element `a[i]` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list; `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends or `k * 2` if it breaks early; `ur` is 0; `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended (either `n-1` or the value when `ul` reached `k * 2`). If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`, with elements set to `0` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was `2` during the loop; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; if `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 1, `re` is incremented by 1 and `res` is updated to contain the single element `a[i]`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged; `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends or `k * 2` if it breaks early; `ur` is 0; `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended plus 1. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not zero; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`, with elements set to `0` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was `2` during the loop; `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`; `ul` is the total count of `2`s found in `l` up to the point the loop ends or `k * 2` if it breaks early; `ur` is 0; `i` is the last value it took before the loop ended plus 2. If `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `re` and `res` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
