To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (though `t` is not used in the provided snippet).
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the input.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `l` is a list where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in `a`.
   - `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `j` is the count of how many times `j + 1` appears in the sublist `a[n:2*n]`.
   - `re`, `ul`, `ur` are all initialized to 0.
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.

2. **Analysis of the Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the statement will print `a[0]` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

3. **Determining the Value of `a[0]`**:
   - From the initial state, we know that `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.
   - Since `i` is 0, this translates to `l[a[0] - 1]` is equal to 2.
   - This means that the integer `a[0]` appears exactly 2 times in the list `a`.

Based on the given information, we can determine that `a[0]` is an integer that appears exactly twice in the list `a`, but we don't know the exact value of `a[0]`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `a[0]`.

Output: **a[0] a[0] (where a[0] is an integer that appears exactly twice in the list `a`)**
