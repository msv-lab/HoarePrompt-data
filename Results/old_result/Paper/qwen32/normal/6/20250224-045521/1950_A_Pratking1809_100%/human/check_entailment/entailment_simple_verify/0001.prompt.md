You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop has executed `q` times, and `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each of the `q` iterations, the user has input integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The loop has printed 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated with the values from the last iteration, but their values after the loop ends are not relevant to the output state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`, which it uses in a loop to process each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks if the digits form a stair by verifying if `a < b < c`. If true, it prints "STAIR".
4. If not a stair, it checks if the digits form a peak by verifying if `a < b > c`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
5. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

The logic in the program aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements, and it handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
