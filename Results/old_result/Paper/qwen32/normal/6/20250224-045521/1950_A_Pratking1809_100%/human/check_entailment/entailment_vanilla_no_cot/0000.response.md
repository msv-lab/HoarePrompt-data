Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three digits and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement. If the digits form a stair (`a < b < c`), it prints "STAIR". If they form a peak (`a < b > c`), it prints "PEAK". Otherwise, it prints "NONE". The program handles all the possible cases as described in the problem description.
