Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, `t`, which it uses in a loop to process each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks if the digits form a stair by verifying if `a < b < c`. If true, it prints "STAIR".
4. If not a stair, it checks if the digits form a peak by verifying if `a < b > c`. If true, it prints "PEAK".
5. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

The logic in the program aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements, and it handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
