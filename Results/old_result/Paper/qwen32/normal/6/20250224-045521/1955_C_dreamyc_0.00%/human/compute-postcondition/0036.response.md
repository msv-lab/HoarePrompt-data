The `while` loop condition is `k and len(nums) >= 2`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is not zero and the length of `nums` is at least 2.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `k` is greater than 0
- `len(nums)` is at least 1

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 2. The current state only guarantees that `len(nums)` is at least 1, so we need to adjust it to be at least 2.

No other states need to be adjusted as the condition only depends on `k` and `len(nums)`.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `len(nums)` must be at least 2**
