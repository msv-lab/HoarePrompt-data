Postcondition: **`k` is greater than 0, `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `a` remains the first element that was removed from `nums`. Similarly, `b` is the last element that was removed from `nums` minus the minimum of `a` and `b` if `k >= 2 * x`, otherwise `b` remains the last element that was removed from `nums`. `len(nums)` is at least 1, and `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `k < 2 * x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
