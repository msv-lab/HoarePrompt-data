The value of `a` is decreased by `x`, where `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` minus the minimum value between `a` and `b`, `b` is the last element of the original `nums`, `nums` has at least 0 elements and is missing its first and last elements from the original state, `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` minus the minimum value between `a` and `b`, `b` is the last element of the original `nums`, `nums` has at least 0 elements and is missing its first and last elements from the original state, `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`.**
