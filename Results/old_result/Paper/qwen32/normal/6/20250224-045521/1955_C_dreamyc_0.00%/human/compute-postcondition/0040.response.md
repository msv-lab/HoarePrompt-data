The code snippet `b -= x` subtracts the value of `x` from `b`. Given that `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`, and `b` is the last element of the original `nums`, the new value of `b` will be `b - x`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums` minus the minimum value between `a` and `b`, `b` is the last element of the original `nums` minus the minimum value between `a` and `b`, `nums` has at least 0 elements and is missing its first and last elements from the original state, `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`.**
