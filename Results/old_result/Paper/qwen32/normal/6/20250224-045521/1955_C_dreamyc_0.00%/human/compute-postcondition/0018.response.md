The code snippet provided appends the value of `b` to the deque `nums`. This means that the length of `nums` will increase by 1, and `b` will be the new last element. Other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state, `nums` is a deque of `n-2` integers, and `b` is the last element of the original `nums`. After appending `b`, `nums` will have `n-1` integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers where the first element is `a` and the remaining `n-2` integers are the original elements of `nums` followed by `b`, `a` and `b` are the first and last elements of the original `nums`, respectively, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`. If `a` is greater than 0, `nums` is a deque of `n-1` integers where the first element is `a` and the remaining `n-2` integers are the original elements of `nums` followed by `b`. `b` is greater than 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 times `x`, then `a` and `b` are each decreased by `x`. `ans` is 0.**
