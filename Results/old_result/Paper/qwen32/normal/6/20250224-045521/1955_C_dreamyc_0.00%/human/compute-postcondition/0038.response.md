Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums`, `b` is the last element of the original `nums`, `nums` has at least 0 elements and is missing its first and last elements from the original state, `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`.**

In simpler terms: `k` remains greater than 0, `a` and `b` retain their values as the first and last elements of the original `nums` respectively, `nums` still lacks its first and last elements, and a new variable `x` is introduced which holds the smaller value between `a` and `b`.
