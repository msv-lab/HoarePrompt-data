The value of `x` is assigned the minimum of `a` and `b`. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `nums` remain unchanged. Since `a` is the first element removed from `nums` and `b` is the last element removed, and `k` must be greater than 0, these conditions still hold.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first element that was removed from `nums`, `b` is the last element that was removed from `nums`, `len(nums)` is at least 1, `x` is the minimum of `a` and `b`.**
