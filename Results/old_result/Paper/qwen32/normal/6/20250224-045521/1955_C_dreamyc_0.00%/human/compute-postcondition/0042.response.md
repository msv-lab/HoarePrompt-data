Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `a` is the first element of the original `nums`, `b` is the last element of the original `nums`, `nums` has at least 0 elements and is missing its first and last elements from the original state, `x` is the minimum value between `a` and `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The values of the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, `nums`, and `x` do not change. The `break` statement exits the most internal loop or if statement without altering the values of these variables.
