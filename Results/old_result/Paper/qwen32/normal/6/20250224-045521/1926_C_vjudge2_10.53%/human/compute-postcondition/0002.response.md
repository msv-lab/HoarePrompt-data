In the provided for loop, the loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. The loop head involves the variable `_` (which is a conventional way to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop) and the range `t`.

Given that the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, and since `t` is already defined as an integer representing the number of test cases with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the only requirement to ensure the loop executes is that `t` should be at least 1.

The variable `numbers` is an empty list, but it is not part of the loop head and does not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `numbers` is an empty list**.

Since the loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1, and the value of `t` is already within the specified range, no further adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

Final State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `numbers` is an empty list**.
