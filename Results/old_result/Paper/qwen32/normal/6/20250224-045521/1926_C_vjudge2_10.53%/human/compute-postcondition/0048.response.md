The code snippet updates the value of `sum_values[i]` to `sum_total`. Given that `i` is 12 and `sum_total` is 49, the value at index 12 of `sum_values` is updated to 49. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 2, 3]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 47, 49]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 12, `word` is "12", `last` is `2`, `remainder` is `1`, `sum_total` is `49`, `i` is 12.**
