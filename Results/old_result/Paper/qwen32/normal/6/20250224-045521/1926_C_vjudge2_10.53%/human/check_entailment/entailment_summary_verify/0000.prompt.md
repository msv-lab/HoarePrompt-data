You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum of a specific value associated with each integer from 1 to `n`. The specific value for each integer is calculated based on the sum of the values of its last digit and the remainder when the integer is divided by 10.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program contains a logical error. Specifically, the loop that populates the `values` and `sum_values` arrays runs only up to `n`, which is the maximum value in the `numbers` list. However, this `n` is not defined in the scope of that loop; it should run up to `max(numbers)`. Additionally, the loop should iterate up to the maximum `n` across all test cases, not just the last one. This means the program will fail for test cases where `n` values vary significantly between different test cases.

Here's a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
2
12
20
```

**Expected Output:**
```
51
102
```

**Actual Output:**
```
51
51
```

In the second test case, the program does not correctly compute the sum of the digits for numbers from 13 to 20 because the `values` and `sum_values` arrays are not populated for those numbers. The program only computes these values up to the maximum `n` from the first test case (which is 12), and then reuses these precomputed values for the second test case, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should ensure that the `values` and `sum_values` arrays are populated up to the maximum `n` across all test cases. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `values` and `sum_values` arrays are populated up to the maximum `n` across all test cases, thus providing the correct output for each test case.
