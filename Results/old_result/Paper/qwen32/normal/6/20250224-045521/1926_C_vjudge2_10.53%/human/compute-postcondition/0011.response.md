Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each equal to the respective input integer `n` provided by the user for each iteration.**

In simple terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `numbers` will be a list containing as many integers as the initial value of `t`, with each integer being the input provided during each corresponding iteration of the loop.
