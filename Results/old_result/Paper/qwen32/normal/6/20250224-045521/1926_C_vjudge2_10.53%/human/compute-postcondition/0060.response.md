Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum of a specific value associated with each integer from 1 to `n`. The specific value for each integer is calculated based on the sum of the values of its last digit and the remainder when the integer is divided by 10.**
