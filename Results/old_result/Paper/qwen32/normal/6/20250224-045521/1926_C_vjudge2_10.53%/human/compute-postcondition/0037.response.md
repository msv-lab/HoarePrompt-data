The code snippet `last = int(word[len(word) - 1])` extracts the last character of the string `word` and converts it to an integer. Given that `word` is `"11"`, the last character is `"1"`, which when converted to an integer, remains `1`. Therefore, `last` is updated to `1`.

The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, sum_total]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 11, `word` is "11", `last` is `1`, `remainder` is the integer value of `i` with its last digit removed, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`, `i` is 11**.
