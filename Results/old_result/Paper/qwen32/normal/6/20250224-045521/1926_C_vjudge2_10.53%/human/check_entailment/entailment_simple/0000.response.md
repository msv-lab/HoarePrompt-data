### Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by calculating the sum of the digits of numbers from 1 to `n` for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the logic and correctness of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then reads `t` integers, each representing a value of `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes two lists: `values` and `sum_values`.
     - `values[i]` will store the sum of the digits of the number `i`.
     - `sum_values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of the `values` up to `i`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - For numbers from 0 to 9, the sum of the digits is the number itself.
   - The program initializes `values` and `sum_values` accordingly for these numbers.

4. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - For numbers from 10 to `n`, the program calculates the sum of the digits using the previously computed values.
   - For a number `i`, the sum of its digits can be expressed as the sum of the digits of its last digit (`last`) and the sum of the digits of the number formed by removing the last digit (`remainder`).

5. **Cumulative Sum**:
   - The program maintains a cumulative sum in `sum_values` to quickly retrieve the sum of the digits for any number up to `n`.

6. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the cumulative sum of the digits up to `n` using the `sum_values` list.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness**:
  - The logic for calculating the sum of the digits and maintaining the cumulative sum seems correct.
  - The program efficiently handles the calculation using dynamic programming principles, avoiding redundant calculations by storing intermediate results.
  - The program correctly initializes the base cases and iteratively builds up the solution for larger numbers.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the smallest possible input (`n = 1`) correctly.
  - It also handles larger inputs (`n` up to `2 * 10^5`) efficiently within the given time constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correctly implemented and should produce the correct output for the given problem within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
