To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]` given the initial state. 

From the initial state:
- `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
- `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`
- `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but based on the code, `i` must be a valid index for `values` and `sum_values`, and since `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `i` could be any integer from 1 to 9 (as `values` and `sum_values` are 0-indexed and have 10 elements).

Let's assume `i` is a specific value, say `i = 5` (we can choose any valid `i` from 1 to 9, but for the sake of this example, let's use 5).

Then:
- `values[i]` would be `values[5]` which is `5`
- `sum_values[i - 1]` would be `sum_values[4]` which is `10`

Thus, `sum_total` would be `5 + 10` which is `15`.

Given that `i` is not specified in the initial state, the output state will describe `sum_total` in terms of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `sum_values` is `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45]`, `total` is `45`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `word` is the string representation of `i`, `last` is the last digit of `i`, `remainder` is the integer value of `i` with its last digit removed, `sum_total` is `values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]`.**
