The code `values[i] = i` sets the `i`-th element of the `values` list to the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 9, the 9th element of the `values` list will be set to 9. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the 9th element set to 9 and all other elements initialized as per the initial state, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with the `i`-th element set to `total`, `total` is increased by the value of `i`, `i` is 9**.
