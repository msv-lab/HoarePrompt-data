The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable used to iterate `t` times. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is not used within the loop body and does not affect the loop's continuation, we do not need to adjust its state.

Given that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 0 < `t` ≤ 10^4, after the previous iteration, `t` would have been decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `numbers` is a list containing the integer `n` and the newly appended integer `n`.**
