The code snippet provided initializes a variable `total` to 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each equal to the respective input integer `n` provided by the user for each iteration; `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` with all elements initialized to 0; `total` is 0.**
