The code snippet concatenates a string to the `word` variable. Specifically, it adds 'a', the character at the index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string, and 'z' to `word`. Given that `n` is between 28 and 52, `n - 28` will be between 0 and 24, which are valid indices for the `alphabet` string.

The character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string can be determined as follows:
- If `n = 28`, the character is 'a' (index 0).
- If `n = 29`, the character is 'b' (index 1).
- ...
- If `n = 52`, the character is 'y' (index 24).

So, `word` will be 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z', where `alphabet[n - 28]` is the character corresponding to the index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 28 <= n <= 52, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `word` is the string 'a' + `alphabet[n - 28]` + 'z'**.
