Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is a string that contains the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is 27, `word` is 'aay'. If `n` is greater than 27 but less than or equal to 52, `word` is the string 'a' + the (n - 28)-th letter of the alphabet + 'z'. Otherwise, if `n` is less than or equal to 27, `word` is the string 'aa' + the (n - 2)-th letter of the alphabet.**
