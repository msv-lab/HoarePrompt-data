Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest word (a 3-letter word) that corresponds to a given encoded sum. The encoding is calculated by summing the positions of the letters in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

### Key Points
- The input is an integer `n`, which is the sum of the positions of the three letters.
- The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest combination of three letters that add up to `n`.
- The possible range of `n` is from 3 (aaa) to 78 (zzz).

### Logic to Find the Lexicographically Smallest Word
To ensure the word is lexicographically smallest, we should:
1. Start with the smallest possible letter ('a') and incrementally choose the next smallest letters.
2. Use a greedy approach to fill in the letters from left to right, ensuring the sum equals `n`.

### Program Analysis
Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)
```

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Handling of Ranges**: The program incorrectly categorizes the ranges for `n` and assigns letters based on these ranges.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly for values of `n` near the boundaries.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for constructing the word does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem:
1. Start with the smallest possible letters and incrementally choose the next smallest letters.
2. Ensure the sum of the positions equals `n`.

### Correct Implementation Example
Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Initialize the word with 'aaa'
        word = [1, 1, 1]
        # Remaining sum to be distributed
        remaining = n - 3
        # Distribute the remaining sum to the letters
        for i in range(3):
            if remaining == 0:
                break
            add = min(25, remaining)
            word[i] += add
            remaining -= add
        # Convert positions to letters
        result = ''.join(chr(pos + 96) for pos in word)
        print(result)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to improper handling of ranges and incorrect logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest word.

Correctness: **False**
