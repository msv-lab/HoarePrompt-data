Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is incremented by 1, and `word` is 'aay' if `n` equals 27. Otherwise, `word` is 'aa' concatenated with the character at the index `n - 3` in the `alphabet` string.**
