You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the t test cases, there is an integer n such that 3 <= n <= 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations, and for each iteration, a `word` has been constructed and printed based on the value of `n`. The variable `i` has reached the value of `t`, and `alphabet` remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest word (a 3-letter word) that corresponds to a given encoded sum. The encoding is calculated by summing the positions of the letters in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).

### Key Points
- The input is an integer `n`, which is the sum of the positions of the three letters.
- The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest combination of three letters that add up to `n`.
- The possible range of `n` is from 3 (aaa) to 78 (zzz).

### Logic to Find the Lexicographically Smallest Word
To ensure the word is lexicographically smallest, we should:
1. Start with the smallest possible letter ('a') and incrementally choose the next smallest letters.
2. Use a greedy approach to fill in the letters from left to right, ensuring the sum equals `n`.

### Program Analysis
Let's analyze the provided program:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)
```

#### Issues in the Program
1. **Incorrect Handling of Ranges**: The program incorrectly categorizes the ranges for `n` and assigns letters based on these ranges.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly for values of `n` near the boundaries.
3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for constructing the word does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word for all possible values of `n`.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem:
1. Start with the smallest possible letters and incrementally choose the next smallest letters.
2. Ensure the sum of the positions equals `n`.

### Correct Implementation Example
Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        # Initialize the word with 'aaa'
        word = [1, 1, 1]
        # Remaining sum to be distributed
        remaining = n - 3
        # Distribute the remaining sum to the letters
        for i in range(3):
            if remaining == 0:
                break
            add = min(25, remaining)
            word[i] += add
            remaining -= add
        # Convert positions to letters
        result = ''.join(chr(pos + 96) for pos in word)
        print(result)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The provided program is incorrect due to improper handling of ranges and incorrect logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest word.

Correctness: **False**
