To determine the output state, let's break down the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

The code snippet is:
```python
word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
```

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is the input integer
- `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `word` is initially an empty string `''`

The code appends to `word` a new string constructed by concatenating:
- The character `'a'`
- The character at index `n - 28` in the `alphabet` string
- The character `'z'`

Let's analyze the new value of `word`:
- `alphabet[n - 28]` will fetch a character from the `alphabet` string. Since `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the index `n - 28` must be a valid index (0 to 25).
- Therefore, `word` will be updated to `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `alphabet`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is the input integer, `alphabet` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `i` is `i + 1`, `word` is `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`**.

In simple terms, `word` is updated to a string that starts with 'a', followed by the character in the `alphabet` string at position `n - 28`, and ends with 'z'. All other variables remain the same.
