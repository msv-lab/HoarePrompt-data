Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by printing a string that consists of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times. However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters are present in the string.

For example, consider the test case `n=2` and `k=2`. The program will output `aabb`, but this string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the letters `a` and `b`. Specifically, the subsequences `ba` are not present. The correct output should be `baab` or any permutation that includes all possible subsequences.

The program needs to generate a De Bruijn sequence for the given `n` and `k`, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring. However, the provided program does not generate such a sequence.

Correctness: **False**
