To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the components involved:

1. **String Slicing**: `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k]`
   - This expression slices the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` from the beginning up to (but not including) the `k`-th character.
   - Since `k` is an integer provided by the user such that `1 <= k <= 26`, the slice will result in the first `k` letters of the alphabet.

2. **String Multiplication**: `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n`
   - This expression multiplies the sliced string by `n`, where `n` is an integer provided by the user such that `1 <= n <= 26`.
   - This means the sliced string (first `k` letters of the alphabet) will be repeated `n` times.

3. **Result**:
   - The final output will be a string consisting of the first `k` letters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times.

Given these steps, the output can be described as follows:
Output: **the first `k` letters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times**.

For example, if `k = 3` and `n = 2`, the output would be `'abcabc'`.

Thus, the final answer is:
Output: **the first `k` letters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times**.
