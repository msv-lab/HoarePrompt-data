The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 676; `i` is 2; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
