The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. This means the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the user's input.

The initial state specifies that `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` have specific conditions. After the code execution, `n` and `k` will be updated to the integers provided by the user, while `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 676; `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.**
