The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop condition is `n != 0`, so for the loop to execute, `n` must not be 0.

Given the state right before the loop: `position` is 0, and `n` is not equal to 0, we need to ensure that `n` is indeed not 0. Since the problem statement already specifies that `n` is not equal to 0, no adjustment is strictly necessary in terms of the loop condition itself. However, to clearly indicate the condition that allows the loop to execute, we can state that `n` must be a positive integer (since `n` is described as the number of non-negative integers to be printed, and it must satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5).

Therefore, the state can be described as:
State: **`position` is 0, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.
