The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is `n // 2`. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be a non-zero value after the division by 2. Therefore, before the division, `n` must be at least 2 (since 2 // 2 = 1, which is not zero).

State: **`position` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
