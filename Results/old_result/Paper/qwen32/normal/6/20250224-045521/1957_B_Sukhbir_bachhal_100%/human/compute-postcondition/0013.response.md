To determine the final output state after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, we need to understand what the loop does and how it terminates.

The loop is:
```python
while n != 0:
    n >>= 1
    position += 1
```

This loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not zero. In each iteration, `n` is right-shifted by 1 bit (which is equivalent to integer division by 2), and `position` is incremented by 1.

The loop terminates when `n` becomes zero. This means `position` will be equal to the number of times `n` can be right-shifted before it becomes zero. This is equivalent to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, excluding the leading zeros.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `position` is 1, `n` is `n // 2^1`
- After 2 iterations: `position` is 2, `n` is `n // 2^2`
- After 3 iterations: `position` is 3, `n` is `n // 2^3` (which is 1 in this case)

From the third iteration, we can infer that `n` was 8 initially because 8 right-shifted by 3 bits equals 1.

In general, if `n` initially has `b` bits (where `b` is the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary), the loop will execute `b` times, and `position` will be `b`. At the end of the loop, `n` will be 0.

Therefore, the final output state is:
- `position` will be the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n`.
- `n` will be 0.

Output State: **position is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial n, n is 0.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `position` will indicate how many times `n` was divided by 2 before it became zero, and `n` itself will be zero.
