Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` was added to `b` or if `x > y` and `lit[i]` was not added to `a`, otherwise `i` remains unchanged. If `x > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `b` if `y >= lit[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1 in this case. If `x <= y`, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty and `x == y`, or based on the conditions described in the else part, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the previous element in `a` or `b`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the conditions and the operations performed within each part.
