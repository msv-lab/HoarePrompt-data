The code snippet `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list. If `a` is not empty, `x` is updated to the last element of `a`. If `a` is empty, the code would raise an `IndexError` because you cannot access the last element of an empty list. However, based on the problem statement, we can infer that `a` is not empty at this point because the initial state mentions that `x` is updated based on the conditions described, and one of those conditions involves `a[-1]`.

Therefore, the value of `x` is now the last element of `a`.

Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1); `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[4]`, `a` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[4]`; `b` is a list that includes `lit[4]` as its last element if `lit[4] > y`, and `y` is updated to `lit[4]` if `lit[4] > y`; `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[4] > x` and `lit[4] > y`; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` was initially empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `i` is 5.**
