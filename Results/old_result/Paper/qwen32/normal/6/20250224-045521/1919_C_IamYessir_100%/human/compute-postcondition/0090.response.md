Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same. If `x < y`, then if `lit[i] >= y`, `x` is set to `lit[i]`; otherwise, `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity or `lit[i]` if `b` was empty and `lit[i] > x`. If `lit[i] > y` and `b` was empty, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`. If `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a`. If `x` is not less than `y`, then `x` and `y` remain unchanged.**
