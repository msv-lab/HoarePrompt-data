The code snippet `x = a[-1]` updates the value of `x` to the last element of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly related to `x`.

Given the initial state, `x` is already defined based on the conditions provided, and `a` is a list where each element is less than or equal to `x` and less than or equal to `y`. After executing the code, `x` is explicitly set to the last element of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or contain elements from `lit` where each element in `a` is less than or equal to `x` and each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b`; and `x` is less than or equal to `y`; `i` is `i + 1`.**
