Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always produce the correct minimum penalty. The logic for splitting the array into subsequences `s` and `t` does not ensure that the penalty `p(s) + p(t)` is minimized. The current approach seems to be trying to balance the elements between `s` and `t` based on the last elements of the subsequences, but it does not guarantee an optimal split.

To solve this problem optimally, a different strategy is needed. One effective approach is to recognize that the minimum penalty can be achieved by considering the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the array. The rest of the elements can be placed in the other subsequence, which will contribute no penalty since it can be empty or non-increasing. The length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence minus one gives the minimum penalty.

Here is a corrected version of the program using this approach:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    import bisect

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        # Find the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence
        lis = []
        for num in a:
            pos = bisect.bisect_right(lis, num)
            if pos == len(lis):
                lis.append(num)
            else:
                lis[pos] = num
        # The minimum penalty is the total number of elements minus the length of the LIS
        min_penalty = n - len(lis)
        results.append(min_penalty)
    print("\n".join(map(str, results)))

func()
```

This version uses binary search to efficiently find the longest non-decreasing subsequence, which is key to solving the problem optimally.
