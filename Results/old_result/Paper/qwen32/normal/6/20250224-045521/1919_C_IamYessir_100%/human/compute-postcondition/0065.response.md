Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or contain elements from `lit` where each element in `a` is less than or equal to `x` and each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty and `lit[i]` is added to `a`, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; if `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is added to `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`; if `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, then `lit[i]` is added to `b` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. `i` is `i + 1`.**
