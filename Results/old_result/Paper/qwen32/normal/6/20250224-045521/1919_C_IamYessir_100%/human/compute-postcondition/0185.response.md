Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; if `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, then `a` contains all its previous elements plus `lit[i]`, and `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[i]` is greater than the previous element in `a`; if `x < y` and `x < lit[i]`, then `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y` or `lit[i] > y` otherwise, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y` or remains the same, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i] > x` or remains the same. In both cases, `cp` is 0 and `i` is incremented by 1. If `x >= y`, the conditions and updates for `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `s`, and `cp` remain unchanged.**
