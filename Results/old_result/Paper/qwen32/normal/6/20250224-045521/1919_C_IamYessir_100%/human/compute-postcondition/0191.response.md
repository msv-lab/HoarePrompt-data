Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the if-else block, the variables retain their described properties based on whether `a` is empty or not. Specifically, `x` will be set to `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise it will be the last element of `a`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `y`, `s`, `i`) maintain their initial states as described in the precondition, with `i` being incremented by 1.
