Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in `lit`, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is `float('inf')`. If `b[i] > b[i - 1]`, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus 1. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element. `i` is 2.**
