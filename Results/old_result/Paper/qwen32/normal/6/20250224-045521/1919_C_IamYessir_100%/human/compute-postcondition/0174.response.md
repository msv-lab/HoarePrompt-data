The provided Python code snippet appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This operation affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless their values are directly dependent on the contents of `a` or `b`.

Here is the impact on the variables:
- `a` is updated by appending `lit[i]` to it.
- `x` is updated to the last element of `a` if `a` was not empty before the operation; otherwise, it remains `float('inf')`.
- `s` is not directly affected by this operation, as it depends on the comparison of consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, which is not altered by simply appending an element to `a`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, as per the initial state description, but this operation is not part of the provided code snippet, so `i` remains unchanged in the context of the given code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list containing the previous elements of `a` plus `lit[i]`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i` (unchanged).**
