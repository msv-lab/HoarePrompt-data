The code snippet appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y` and greater than `x`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, these conditions remain valid. The value of `b` is now updated to include `lit[i]` as its last element. The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `cp`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list and now includes `lit[i]` as its last element; `cp` is 0; `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b` if `b` is not an empty list; `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`; `x` is less than `lit[i]`; and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` with `lit[i]` being greater than `x`.**
