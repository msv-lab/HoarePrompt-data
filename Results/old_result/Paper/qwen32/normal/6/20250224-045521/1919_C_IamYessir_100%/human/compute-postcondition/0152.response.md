The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element `lit[i]` to the end of the list `a`.

Given the initial state, `a` could be either empty or not empty. After appending `lit[i]` to `a`, `a` is no longer empty (if it was empty before) and its last element is now `lit[i]`. This change affects the value of `x`, which is the last element of `a`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `y`, `s`) remain unchanged. The condition `x < y` may still be true, but it needs to be re-evaluated since `x` has changed. The condition `x >= lit[i]` is also true by the problem statement, but since `x` is now `lit[i]`, this condition is an equality.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is not an empty list and its last element is `lit[i]`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `x < y` may still be true; `x` is equal to `lit[i]`.**
