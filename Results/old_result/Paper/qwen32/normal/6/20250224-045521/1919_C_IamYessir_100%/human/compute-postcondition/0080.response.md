Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1 and `n` remains the same. If `x >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > y`, then `a` includes an additional element `lit[i]` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.**
