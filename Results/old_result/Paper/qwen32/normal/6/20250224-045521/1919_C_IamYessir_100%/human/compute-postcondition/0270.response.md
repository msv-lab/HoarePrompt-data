Output State: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and now it includes an additional element `lit[i]`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; if `a` was an empty list before, `x` was `float('inf')` and is now `lit[i]`; otherwise, `x` remains the last element of `a`; if `b` is an empty list, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`; `x` is less than `y` and this condition is true; `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**

In simpler terms: The list `a` now includes an additional element `lit[i]`. If `a` was previously empty, `x` is now `lit[i]`; otherwise, `x` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their previous states.
