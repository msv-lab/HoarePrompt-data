Postcondition: **`s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element (potentially increased by 1), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and if `x < lit[i]`, `a` includes `lit[i]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[i]`. `b` is a list that includes `lit[4]` as its last element if `lit[4] > y`, and `y` is updated to `lit[4]` if `lit[4] > y`. `s` is incremented by 1 if `lit[4] > x` and `lit[4] > y`. `cp` is 0. `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` was initially empty, otherwise `x` is updated based on the conditions described. If `b` was initially empty, `y` is `float('inf')`; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. `i` is 4. If `lit[4] > x` and `lit[4] <= y`, `a` includes `lit[4]` as its last element, updating `x` to `lit[4]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of variables after the if-else block executes, considering both possible paths (if `y >= lit[i]` and if `y < lit[i]`).
