The code snippet `y = b[-1]` assigns the last element of the list `b` to the variable `y`. Based on the initial state provided, `y` was already defined as `float('inf')` if `b` was empty, or the last element of `b` if `b` was not empty. After executing the code, `y` will definitely be the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, and it will remain `float('inf')` if `b` is still empty.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are lists containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y` for `a`, and `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x` for `b`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; `y` is the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`.**
