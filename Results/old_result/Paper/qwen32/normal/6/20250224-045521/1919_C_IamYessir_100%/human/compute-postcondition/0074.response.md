The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged as per the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty. Otherwise, `x` is positive infinity, and `y` is positive infinity.**
