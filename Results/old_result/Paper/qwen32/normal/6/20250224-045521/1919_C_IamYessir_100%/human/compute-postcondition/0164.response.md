Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list, and contains elements `lit[i]` based on the condition `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is updated to the last element of `a` or `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y` or `lit[i] > y` respectively; `y` is updated to the last element of `b` or `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` or `y >= lit[i] > x` respectively; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element. If `x > y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x` and `lit[i] > y`; `b` includes `lit[i]` if `lit[i] <= x` and `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`. If `x <= y`, `a` includes `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > y`; `b` includes `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i] > x` and `y` remains unchanged or is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i] > x`.**
