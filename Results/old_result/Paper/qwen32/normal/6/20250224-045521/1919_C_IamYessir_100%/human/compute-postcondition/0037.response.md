The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This affects the list `a` by appending a new element to it. The other variables remain unchanged unless `a` was initially empty, in which case `x` would be updated to the value of `lit[i]` because `x` is defined as the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list
- `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list
- `cp` is 0
- `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a` if `a` is not an empty list
- `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b` if `b` is not an empty list
- `x` is less than `y`
- `lit[i]` is greater than `y`

After the code `a.append(lit[i])` is executed:
- The list `a` now includes the new element `lit[i]` at the end.
- If `a` was previously empty, `x` is updated to `lit[i]` because `x` is defined as the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list that now includes the new element `lit[i]`; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was previously empty, otherwise `x` remains the last element of the original `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b` if `b` is not an empty list; `x` is less than `y`; `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**
