The code snippet `a.append(lit[i])` appends the `i`-th element of the list `lit` to the list `a`. This directly affects the list `a` by adding a new element to it. The values of other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly influenced by the new value of `a`.

Given the initial state, the following changes occur:
- `a` now contains the additional element `lit[i]`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state description, but the code snippet itself does not modify `i`. Therefore, the increment of `i` remains part of the precondition and is not affected by this specific line of code.
- `x` and `y` are dependent on the contents of `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `a` has been modified, `x` might need to be updated. Specifically, if `a` was empty before this operation, `x` would now be `lit[i]` (the newly added element). If `a` was not empty, `x` would remain the last element of `a` before this operation, which is still valid as the newly added element does not affect the last element of the previous `a`.
- The values of `s` and `b` are not affected by this operation directly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is a list containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] > x` if `x > y`, otherwise `lit[i] > y`, and now includes `lit[i]` as its last element; `b` is a list containing elements `lit[i]` based on the conditions `lit[i] <= x` if `x > y`, otherwise `y >= lit[i] > x`; `cp` is 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `a` was empty before, otherwise `x` remains the last element of the previous `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `i` is `i + 1`.**
