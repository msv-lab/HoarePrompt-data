The code snippet `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. The initial state specifies that `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, and the current element `b[i]` is greater than the previous element `b[i - 1]`. These conditions remain unchanged by the execution of the code snippet. The only variable that changes is `s`.

Output State: **`b` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and the current element `b[i]` is greater than the previous element `b[i - 1]`; `s` is incremented by 1.**
