Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0; the length of `a` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')`.**

In this output state, the variable `x` has been assigned the value `float('inf')`, representing positive infinity. All other variables retain their initial values and states as described in the initial condition.
