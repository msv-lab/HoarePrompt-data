The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, `len(a)`, and `i` remain unchanged; `s` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `cp`, `x`, `y`, and `len(a)` remain unchanged; `i` is 3; `s` is increased by 1.**
