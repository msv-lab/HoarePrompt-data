Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `b` is either an empty list or not an empty list; `cp` is 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is empty, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`; `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element plus the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element; `x` is less than `y` and the condition `x < y` is true; `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**
