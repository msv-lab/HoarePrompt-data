The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. This means that the list `b` will now include one more element, which is `lit[i]`. The value of `i` is not changed by this operation, and it is assumed that `i` is already a valid index for the list `lit`.

Given the initial state, the only change is that `b` now contains an additional element. The value of `y` will be updated to the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty. Since `b` is updated by appending `lit[i]`, `y` will be set to `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or contain elements from `lit` where each element in `a` is less than or equal to `x` and each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, otherwise `x` is the last element of `a`; `y` is `lit[i]`; and `x` is less than or equal to `y`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the list `b` now includes the element `lit[i]`, and `y` is updated to `lit[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
