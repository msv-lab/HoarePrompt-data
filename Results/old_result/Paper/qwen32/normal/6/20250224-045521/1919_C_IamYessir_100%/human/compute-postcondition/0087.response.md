Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. If `b` was empty and `y >= lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` is now `lit[i]` and `b` includes `lit[i]` as its last element. Otherwise, `y` retains its previous value (either positive infinity or the last element of `b`).**
