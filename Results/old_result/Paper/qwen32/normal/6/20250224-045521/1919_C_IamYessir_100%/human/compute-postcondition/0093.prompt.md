Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is an empty list; `b` is an empty list; `cp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if len(a) == 0:
        x = float('inf')
    else:
        x = a[-1]
    if len(b) == 0:
        y = float('inf')
    else:
        y = b[-1]
    if x > y:
        if y >= lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])
        elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
    elif x == y:
        a.append(lit[i])
    elif x < y:
        if x >= lit[i]:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif lit[i] > y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
            b.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or contain elements from `lit` where each element in `a` is less than or equal to `x` and each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is `lit[i]` if `x` equals `y`, otherwise `x` is either `float('inf')` if `a` is an empty list, or the last element of `a`; `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is an empty list, or the last element of `b`; and `x` is less than or equal to `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `lit` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` and `b` are either empty lists or contain elements from `lit` where each element in `a` is less than or equal to `x` and each element in `b` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`; `cp` remains 0; `x` is updated to `lit[i]` if `b` is empty or `lit[i]` is less than or equal to the previous `x`; `y` is updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and less than or equal to the previous `y` or if `b` was previously empty and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`; `x` is less than or equal to `y`; `i` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same. If `x > y`, `y` is updated based on the conditions: if `y >= lit[i]` and `b` was empty, `y` is set to `lit[i]`; if `y >= lit[i]` and `b` was not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` before the append operation, and `b` now has an additional element which is `lit[i]`; if `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] > x`, `y` is updated to `lit[i]`; if `y < lit[i]` and `b` was empty, `y` becomes `lit[i]`; otherwise, `lit[i]` is appended to `b` and `y` becomes the last element of `b`; if `y < lit[i]` and `lit[i] <= x` and `x >= lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a` and `x` is updated to `lit[i]`. If `x <= y`, if `x` was equal to `y`, `a` has a new element `lit[i]` appended to it, `x` is set to `lit[i]`, and `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity; if `x` was not equal to `y` and `x < y`, if `lit[i] >= y`, `x` is set to `lit[i]`; otherwise, `x` remains the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity; if `lit[i] > y` and `b` was empty, `lit[i]` is appended to `b`; if `lit[i] > y`, `lit[i]` is appended to `a`; if `x` was not less than `y`, `x` and `y` remain unchanged. `x` is the last element of the list `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is positive infinity. `y` is positive infinity if `b` is empty, otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
