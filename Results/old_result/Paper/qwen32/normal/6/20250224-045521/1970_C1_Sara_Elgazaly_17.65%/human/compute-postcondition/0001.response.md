The provided code snippet initializes a `defaultdict` of lists named `lst`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, the tree edges, the starting node `u_i`, or the integers `x` and `y`. The only change is the introduction of the `lst` variable, which is now a `defaultdict` of lists.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, the tree is represented by n-1 edges where each edge is a pair of integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. The last line contains t integers (u_1, ..., u_t) where each u_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, representing the starting node for each round. `x` and `y` are the two integers read from the input. `lst` is a defaultdict of lists.**
