### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the original assessment in light of the problem description and the function summary provided.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the list and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the current element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.
   - However, this logic only handles one split per iteration and does not guarantee that the list will be fully sorted after a single pass.

2. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After attempting a single pass of splitting, the program checks if the list is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incomplete Splits:**
   - The program only performs one pass of splitting and does not continue to check for further splits that could potentially sort the list.
   - For example, in the counterexample provided, the program does not perform enough splits to transform the array into a sorted order.

2. **Handling Multiple Splits:**
   - The program should continue to attempt splits until no more splits can be made that result in a non-decreasing order.
   - The current implementation does not handle multiple splits or nested splits properly.

#### Correctness:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle all cases and does not perform enough splits to ensure the list is sorted.
- The provided counterexample demonstrates a scenario where the program fails to produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The program is indeed incorrect because it does not fully explore all possible splits and transformations needed to sort the array in non-decreasing order.

**Final: False**
