Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap:
The task is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `t`, the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the length of the array, and then reads the array itself.

2. **Transformation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is less than the previous one and the previous element is at least 10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array at the same position.
   - However, the logic to check if the previous element should be split is incorrect. The condition `list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10` is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements. This condition only checks if the current element is smaller than the previous one and if the previous one is at least 10. It does not ensure that splitting the previous element will help in sorting the array.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After attempting to transform the array, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function simply checks if the array is equal to its sorted version.

### Issues:
- The main issue with the program is the logic used to decide when to split an element. The program only splits an element if it is greater than the next element and is at least 10, which is not a sufficient condition to ensure the array can be sorted by splitting.
- The program does not consider other possible ways to split elements to achieve a sorted array.
- The program does not handle cases where multiple splits might be necessary to sort the array.

### Correctness:
Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted by splitting elements as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
