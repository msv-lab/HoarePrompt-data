Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for transforming the array into a non-decreasing order. Specifically, the logic for splitting elements and checking if the array is sorted is flawed. Here are a few issues:

1. The program only considers splitting the element at the current index if it is greater than the next element and greater than 10. However, it does not handle cases where multiple splits are required or where splits need to be performed on elements that are not directly adjacent to a smaller element.

2. The program only performs one split per iteration of the outer loop, which may not be sufficient to fully transform the array into a non-decreasing order. It should continue to attempt splits until no more splits can be made that result in a non-decreasing order.

3. The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted, but the program does not guarantee that the array is in the best possible state for sorting after the splits. It might miss opportunities to sort the array by not fully exploring all possible splits.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4
100 10 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Explanation:**
The array can be transformed as follows:
- Split 100 into 1, 0, 0.
- The array becomes [1, 0, 0, 10, 1, 2].
- Further splits are not needed as the array can be sorted to [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 10].

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

The program does not handle this case correctly because it does not perform enough splits and does not fully explore all possibilities for transforming the array into a non-decreasing order. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
