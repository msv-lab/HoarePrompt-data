The code snippet `q = 2 ** (p - 1)` calculates `q` as 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`, where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k` (the absolute value of `n - m`).

Given the initial state, `q` is newly introduced and calculated based on the existing value of `p`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string; `i` is incremented by 1; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`.**
