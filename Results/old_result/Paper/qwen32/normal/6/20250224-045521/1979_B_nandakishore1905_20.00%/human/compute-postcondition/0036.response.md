The `print(1)` statement in the given code snippet will output the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `i`. This is because the `print` statement is explicitly instructed to print the number `1`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation:

1. `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
2. `n` and `m` are integers that are obtained from the input.
3. `k` is the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `m`.
4. `i` is incremented by 1 (though this does not affect the `print` statement).

Despite the presence and values of these variables, the `print(1)` statement will not use any of them. It simply outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
