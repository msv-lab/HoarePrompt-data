You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the difference between the two integers and prints this value. The printed value is determined by specific conditions related to the difference being a power of two, the integers being zero, and the parity of the non-zero integer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the length of the longest common subsegment of the sequences \(a\) and \(b\). The logic in the program seems to be based on some incorrect assumptions or misunderstandings of the problem.

Let's consider a specific test case to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

### Test Case:
```
2
0 1
12 4
```

### Expected Output:
```
1
8
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
- For the first test case (\(x = 0, y = 1\)):
  - Sequence \(a\) starts as: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...]
  - Sequence \(b\) starts as: [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, ...]
  - The longest common subsegment is [1], so the length is 1.

- For the second test case (\(x = 12, y = 4\)):
  - Sequence \(a\) starts as: [8, 15, 14, 11, 10, 13, 12, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, ...]
  - Sequence \(b\) starts as: [4, 7, 6, 1, 0, 3, 2, 15, 14, 11, 10, 13, 12, ...]
  - The longest common subsegment is [3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 14], so the length is 8.

### Actual Output from the Program:
The program does not produce the expected output for these test cases. The logic in the program does not correctly handle the XOR operation and the comparison of the sequences. Specifically, the program seems to be calculating something related to the difference between \(x\) and \(y\) and its binary representation, which is not directly relevant to finding the longest common subsegment.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not produce the correct output for the given test cases, it is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
