Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `k & (k - 1) == 0`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, if `n == 0` and `m % 2 != 0`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string; `p` is the length of the string `l`; `q` is set to 2.**
