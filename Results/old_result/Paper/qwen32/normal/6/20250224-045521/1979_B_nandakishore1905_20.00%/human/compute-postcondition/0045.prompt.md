Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers x and y such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y. The function will be called with multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains two integers x and y as described.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    k = abs(n - m)
    if k & k - 1 == 0:
        print(k)
    elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
        print(1)
    elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
        print(2)
    else:
        l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
        p = len(l)
        q = 2 ** (p - 1)
        print(k - q)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`. If `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is set to 2. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`. If `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is set to 2 if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, or 2 raised to the power of `p - 1` otherwise. `i` is incremented by 1 in all cases. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `i` is incremented by 1. If `k & (k - 1) == 0`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, if `n == 0` and `m % 2 != 0`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string; `p` is the length of the string `l`; `q` is set to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
