Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2 raised to the power of `p - 1`. If `k` is a power of 2, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k`. If `k` is not a power of 2, no further changes are made to `n`, `m`, or `k` except for the computation of `l`, `p`, and `q`.**
