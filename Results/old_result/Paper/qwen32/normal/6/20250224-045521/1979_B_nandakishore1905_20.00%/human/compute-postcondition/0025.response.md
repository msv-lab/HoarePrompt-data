The code snippet assigns the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) to the variable `l`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the conditions related to them remain unchanged unless `k` is not a power of 2, which is not specified to affect `n`, `m`, or `k` directly in this snippet. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since the increment operation is not included in the provided code snippet, we focus on the assignment to `l`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4); `n` and `m` are the integers obtained from the input; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`; `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string; `i` is incremented by 1**.
