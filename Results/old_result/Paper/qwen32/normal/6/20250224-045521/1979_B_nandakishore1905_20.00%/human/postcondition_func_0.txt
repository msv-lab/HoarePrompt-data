The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the difference between the two integers and prints this value. The printed value is determined by specific conditions related to the difference being a power of two, the integers being zero, and the parity of the non-zero integer.
