The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `p` from the input. It checks if there exists any index `i` such that `p[p[i]] == i`. If such an index exists, it prints `2` and terminates. If no such index exists after checking all possibilities, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value.
