### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

**Problem Analysis:**
- Monocarp needs at least 2 friends at his party.
- Each friend `i` has a best friend `p[i]`.
- For a friend `i` to come to the party, both `i` and `p[i]` must receive invitations.
- We need to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

**Program Analysis:**
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `p` of best friends.
- It then checks if there exists a pair `(i, p[i])` such that `p[p[i]] == i`. This condition indicates that `i` and `p[i]` are each other's best friends.
- If such a pair exists, it prints `2` because only inviting `i` and `p[i]` is sufficient to ensure both come to the party.
- If no such pair exists, it prints `3`. This is based on the assumption that in the worst case, Monocarp needs to invite 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come to the party.

**Evaluation:**
- The program correctly identifies pairs of best friends who are each other's best friends and ensures that only 2 invitations are needed in such cases.
- However, the assumption that 3 invitations are always sufficient when no such pair exists is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `n=4` and `p=[2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, no pair of best friends are each other's best friends, but inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 is not the minimum solution. Inviting friends 1, 2, and 4 would also work, but the minimum is actually 3, which the program correctly identifies. However, consider another case like `n=5` and `p=[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`. Here, inviting friends 1 and 4 is sufficient, but the program would incorrectly print `3`.

Given these points, the program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it does not always determine the minimum number of invitations required when no pair of best friends are each other's best friends.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
