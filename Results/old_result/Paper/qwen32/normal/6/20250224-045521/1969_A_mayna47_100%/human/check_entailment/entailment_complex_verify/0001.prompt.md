You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i != i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: The loop completes all iterations (i.e., i goes from 1 to n) without printing 2 or returning early. The values of t, n, p, and v remain unchanged from their initial state.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `p` from the input. It checks if there exists any index `i` such that `p[p[i]] == i`. If such an index exists, it prints `2` and terminates. If no such index exists after checking all possibilities, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program based on the problem description.

The program is designed to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send to ensure at least two friends come to the party. The logic is based on the observation that if there exists a pair of friends (i, p_i) such that p_i is the best friend of i and i is the best friend of p_i (i.e., v[v[i]] == i), then sending invitations to these two friends is sufficient to have at least two friends attend the party. If no such pair exists, the program assumes that Monocarp needs to invite at least three friends to ensure at least two attend.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
3. It then iterates through each friend `i` and checks if `v[v[i]] == i`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and exits the function, indicating that only two invitations are needed.
4. If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`, suggesting that at least three invitations are necessary.

Let's evaluate if this logic is correct:

- The program correctly identifies pairs of friends who are best friends with each other. If such a pair exists, sending invitations to these two friends is indeed the minimum required to have at least two friends attend the party.
- However, the program assumes that if no such pair exists, the answer is always `3`. This is not necessarily true. For example, consider the case where n=4 and the best friend list is [2, 3, 4, 1]. Here, there are no pairs of friends who are best friends with each other, but sending invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3 would result in friends 1 and 2 attending the party. Thus, the minimum number of invitations needed is `3`, but there might be cases where fewer than three invitations are sufficient.

However, the provided program does not cover all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that if no pair of best friends exists, the answer is always `3`. It doesn't consider cases where inviting fewer than three friends might still result in at least two friends attending the party.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.
