The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state and the conditions provided do not affect the value printed by this statement. The variables `t`, `n`, `p`, and `v` are defined and have specific constraints, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the integer `2` as specified.

Output: **2**
