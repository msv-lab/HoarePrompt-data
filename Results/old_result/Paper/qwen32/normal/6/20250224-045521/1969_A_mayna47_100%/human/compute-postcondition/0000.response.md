The provided code snippet only includes the line `n = int(input())`. This line reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of `n` integers with specific properties. The execution of this line changes the value of `n` to the user input, but it does not affect the properties of `t` or `p` as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is the input integer; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.**
