The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```
At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value between 1 and `n`, inclusive. To proceed to the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `k + 1`.

Since `n` does not change throughout the loop, it remains the same.

So, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers read from the input. Additionally, `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`; `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**

Since we don't know the exact value of `k` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that n >= 1; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers read from the input. Additionally, `v[v[i]]` is not equal to `i`; `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration**
