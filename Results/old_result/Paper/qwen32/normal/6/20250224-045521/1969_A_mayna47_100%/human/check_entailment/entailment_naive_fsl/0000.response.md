Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly handle all potential cases for the problem description. Specifically, the code only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and directly returns 2 if such a pair is found. However, it does not consider other possible cases where more than one pair of friends can come to the party by sending invitations to a minimum number of friends.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
6
1 3 5 2 4 6
```
The correct output for the last test case should be `3`, but the provided code will incorrectly output `2` because it only checks for mutual best friends and does not consider other valid combinations.

A correct approach would involve finding cycles in the list of best friends and determining the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends come to the party. The provided code does not account for such cycles and only handles the simplest case of mutual best friends.

Thus, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
