Given the initial state, we have several variables and lists described:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is an integer such that n >= 1.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n`, `p_i` != `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct.
- `v` is a list where the first element is `0` and the subsequent elements are the integers read from the input. Additionally, `v[v[i]]` equals `i`.

However, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, or `v`. The values of these variables do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output of the code will be:

Output: **2**
