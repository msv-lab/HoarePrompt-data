The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. The value of `bets` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.**
