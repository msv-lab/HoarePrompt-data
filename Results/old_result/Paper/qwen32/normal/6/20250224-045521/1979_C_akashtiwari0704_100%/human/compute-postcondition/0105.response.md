Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where each element a[i] is `prod // a[i]` for i in range(bets), `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the new `a`, `i` is `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is the sum of all elements in the new `a`. The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
