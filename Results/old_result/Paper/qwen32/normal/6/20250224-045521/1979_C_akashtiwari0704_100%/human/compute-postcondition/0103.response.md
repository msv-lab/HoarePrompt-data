The code snippet provided adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given that `i` is 2, `sumo` is initially calculated as `int(a[0]) + int(a[1])`. After the code executes, `sumo` will be updated to include `int(a[2])`.

Thus, the new value of `sumo` will be `int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `T` is 2, `g` is the LCM of all elements in `l`, `l` is a list with at least one element, `bets` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the first element is `prod // a[0]`, the second element is `prod // a[1]`, and the third element is `prod // a[2]`, `prod` is the LCM of all elements in the new `a`, `i` is 2, `sumo` is `int(a[0]) + int(a[1]) + int(a[2])`.**
