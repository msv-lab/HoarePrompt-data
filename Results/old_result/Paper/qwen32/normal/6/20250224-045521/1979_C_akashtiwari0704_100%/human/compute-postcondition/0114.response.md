The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Given that `i` has been incremented by 1 before this line, the current value of `i` is used to index into the list `a`.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.**

In simpler terms, `bets` still needs to be greater than `i + 1`, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `ans` has been updated to include the string representation of the element at the new index `i` in the list `a`, followed by a space.
