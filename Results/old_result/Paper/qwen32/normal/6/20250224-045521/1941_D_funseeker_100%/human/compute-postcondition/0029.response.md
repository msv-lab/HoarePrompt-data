The only object in the loop head is the variable `q`, which iterates over the elements of the set `ans`. For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `ans` is not empty.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer (converted from the first part of the string returned by `func_1()`), `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` and is either '0' or '?', `temp` is an empty set**
