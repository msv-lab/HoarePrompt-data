Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', and only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is an integer, `temp` is a set containing all the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', and only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'.**

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `ans` is now updated to contain the same elements as the set `temp`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `temp` remain unchanged. The set `ans` now reflects the calculations performed based on the condition of `c`.
