The code snippet `ans = temp` assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. Since `temp` is not relevant in the final state as it is reset in each iteration, the assignment effectively clears the set `ans` and makes it an empty set. The other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is an empty set, `r` is an integer, `c` is either '0' or '?'.**
