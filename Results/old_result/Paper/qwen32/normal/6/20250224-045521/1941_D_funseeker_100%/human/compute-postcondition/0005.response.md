The code snippet provided initializes a new set variable `temp` without affecting any of the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is an integer, `c` is the result of splitting the string returned by `func_1()`, `temp` is an empty set.**
