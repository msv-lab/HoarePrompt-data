To determine the output of the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement, we need to understand the set `ans` and how it is constructed based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`ans`**: This is a set containing all possible values that can be reached by iteratively applying the operations defined by `r` and `c` for `m` times starting from `x`.
2. **`0` in `ans`**: If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` also includes the value `n`.
3. **`0` not in `ans`**: If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` does not include `n`.

### Operations:
- **`r` and `c`**: These operations are applied iteratively `m` times starting from `x`.
- **`*sorted(ans)`**: This will print the elements of the set `ans` in ascending order.

### Analysis:
- The exact values in `ans` depend on the operations `r` and `c`, the starting value `x`, and the number of iterations `m`.
- Since the operations `r` and `c` are not explicitly defined, we can't determine the exact numerical values in `ans`.
- However, we can describe the structure of the output based on the given conditions.

### Output Description:
- The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the elements of `ans` in sorted order.
- If `0` is one of the values in `ans`, then `n` will also be included in `ans`.
- If `0` is not in `ans`, then `n` will not be included in `ans`.

### Final Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the sorted values of `ans`, which includes `n` if and only if `0` is in `ans`.

Output: **sorted values of `ans` (where if `0` is in `ans`, `n` is also included)**
