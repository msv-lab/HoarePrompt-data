The code snippet provided initializes an empty set named `temp`. This operation does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` if `c` is '1' or '?', and only `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is an integer, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`, `temp` is an empty set.**
