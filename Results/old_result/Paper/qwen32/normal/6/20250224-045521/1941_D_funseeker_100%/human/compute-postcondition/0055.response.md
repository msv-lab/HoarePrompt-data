Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing at least one element, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()`. If `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing one element, which is `(q + r) % n`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.**
