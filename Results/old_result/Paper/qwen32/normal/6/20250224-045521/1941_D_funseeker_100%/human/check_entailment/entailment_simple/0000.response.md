### Reasoning:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine the possible positions of the ball after a series of throws, given the constraints and the partial information about the direction of each throw. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x` using `func_3()`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` using `func_1()`.

2. **Processing Each Throw**:
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it calculates the possible new positions based on the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - It updates `ans` to be the set of possible positions `temp` after each throw.

3. **Handling Circular Indexing**:
   - The use of modulo operation `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` correctly handles the circular nature of the players standing in a circle.
   - The program also includes a check to handle the case where the modulo operation results in `0`. If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is replaced with `n` to ensure the players are numbered from `1` to `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all throws, the program prints the number of unique possible positions in `ans`.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these positions.

### Correctness:

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all the specified scenarios and constraints. It correctly computes all possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, taking into account the partial information about the direction of each throw.

**Correctness: True**
