To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given Python code snippet on the existing variables and the introduction of new variables. Here's the analysis:

The provided code snippet is:
```python
r, c = func_1().split()
```

This line of code calls a function `func_1()` which presumably returns a string. This string is then split into two parts, which are assigned to the variables `r` and `c` respectively.

Given that the function `func_1()` is not defined in the initial state, we can only make assumptions about its return value. However, based on the context and typical usage, we can assume that `func_1()` returns a string with two space-separated values that can be split into two parts.

Since the exact return value of `func_1()` is not specified, we cannot determine the specific values of `r` and `c`. However, we can state that `r` and `c` are the result of splitting the string returned by `func_1()`.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000
- `m` is an integer greater than 0
- `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`
- `ans` is a set containing the value `x`

The only changes to the state are the introduction of the new variables `r` and `c`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` and `c` are the result of splitting the string returned by `func_1()`**.
