The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the element `0` from the set `ans` if it is present. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` includes `0`, after executing this line, `0` will no longer be in the set `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all possible values that can be reached by iteratively applying the operations defined by `r` and `c` for `m` times starting from `x`, excluding `0`.**
