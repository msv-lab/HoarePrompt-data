Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline()` to read input line by line, which is efficient for large inputs.
   - It defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) to parse integers and lists of integers from the input.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` containing the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each of the `m` throws, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It updates the set `ans` to include the possible positions of the ball after each throw:
     - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds the position after a clockwise throw: `(q + r) % n`.
     - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds the position after a counterclockwise throw: `(q - r) % n`.
   - The `% n` operation ensures that the position wraps around the circle correctly.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is replaced with `n` because player numbers are 1-based.
   - This step ensures that the output player numbers are within the valid range `[1, n]`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all throws, the program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic for updating the set `ans` with possible positions after each throw is correct.
  - The use of a set ensures that each player number is unique.
  - The handling of the 1-based indexing by converting `0` to `n` is appropriate.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles cases where the direction is unknown (`'?'`) by considering both possible directions.
  - It also correctly handles the wrapping around of player positions using the modulo operation.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of a set for `ans` and the efficient input reading methods ensure that the program can handle the upper limits of the input constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It efficiently processes each test case and handles all specified edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
