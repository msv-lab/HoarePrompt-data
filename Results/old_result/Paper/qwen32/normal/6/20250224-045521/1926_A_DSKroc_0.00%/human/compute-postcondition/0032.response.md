`bc` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\); `ac` is 1 if `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 0; `bc` is `bc + 1`; `s` is a non-empty string; `q` is \(q + 1\); `i` is the next character in `s`.
