Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\); `s` is a non-empty string; `q` is \(q + 1\); `i` is the next character in `s` after the current `i`; `bc` is `bc + 1`.**

Natural Language: The value of `bc` has been incremented by 1. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `q`, and `i`) retain their previous values.
