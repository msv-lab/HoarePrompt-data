Output State: **`t` is the integer input provided such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\); `ac` is 2 if `i` is 'A', otherwise `ac` is 1; `bc` is 1 if `i` is not 'A', otherwise `bc` is 0; `s` is a non-empty string; `q` is \(q + 1\); `i` is the next character in `s`.**

In natural language, the value of `ac` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was 'A', `ac` becomes 2, otherwise, it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
