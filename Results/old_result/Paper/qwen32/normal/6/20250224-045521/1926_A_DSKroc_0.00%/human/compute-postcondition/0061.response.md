Postcondition: **`t` remains the same as the initial input, `q` will be equal to `t` after the loop finishes, `s` will be the string from the last test case, `ac` and `bc` will be the counts of 'A' and non-'A' characters, respectively, in the last test case's string, and `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`**
