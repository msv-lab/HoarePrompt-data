To determine the new value of `t` after the given code execution, we start by analyzing the initial state and the provided statement.

Initial State:
- `t` is calculated based on the value of `b` as either `b * 2 // 5` if divisible by 5, otherwise `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`.
- `a` is an integer from the first input.
- `b` is an integer from the second input.
- `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1` and is not divisible by 15.

The code modifies `t` as follows:
```python
t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
```

Let's break down the new value of `t`:
- `t2 // 15` is the integer division of `t2` by 15.
- Adding 1 to the result of `t2 // 15` and then to the current value of `t` gives the new value of `t`.

Given that `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` will result in an integer that is less than `t2 / 15`.

The new value of `t` is:
\[ t_{\text{new}} = t + \left(\frac{t2}{15}\right) + 1 \]
where \(\left(\frac{t2}{15}\right)\) is the integer division.

Since the other variables (`a`, `b`, `t1`, and `t2`) are not modified by the code, they remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`; `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input; `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4` and is less than `a`; `t2` is equal to `a - t1` and is not divisible by 15.**
