The code converts the string `b` into an integer. Therefore, the variable `b` is now an integer rather than a string. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input.**
