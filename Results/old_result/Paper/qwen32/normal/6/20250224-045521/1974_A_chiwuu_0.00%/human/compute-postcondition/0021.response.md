Postcondition: **`t` is an integer, `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input, `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input, and `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, the program does not change `t`. Otherwise, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`. If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`. Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.**
