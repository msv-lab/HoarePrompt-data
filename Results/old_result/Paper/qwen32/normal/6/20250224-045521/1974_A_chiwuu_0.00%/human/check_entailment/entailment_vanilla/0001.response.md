Let's analyze the given Python program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The code calculates the number of screens required to place `b` 2x2 icons.
   - Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5x3), the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`t`) is calculated as:
     - `t = b * 2` (each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, which is 2 units of 2 cells each)
     - If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is divided by 5.
     - If `t` is not divisible by 5, `t` is divided by 5 and then rounded up by adding 1.
   - This logic seems correct for determining the minimum number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   - The code calculates the remaining space available after placing the 2x2 icons:
     - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`
     - `t1` represents the remaining number of 1x1 cells available after placing the 2x2 icons.

4. **Calculating Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space `t1` is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1` is not sufficient, the code calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`).
   - The additional screens required are then calculated:
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:
The logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 icons is correct, but the logic for handling the remaining 1x1 icons is incorrect. The calculation for `t1` and the logic to determine additional screens for 1x1 icons is flawed.

For example, consider the test case `12 4` (12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons):
- The 4 2x2 icons will occupy 16 cells (4 * 4 = 16), which requires 2 screens (since 16 cells > 15 cells per screen).
- After placing the 2x2 icons, there are 14 cells left in the 2 screens (2 * 15 - 16 = 14).
- The remaining 12 1x1 icons can fit into these 14 cells, so no additional screens are needed.
- The program, however, might incorrectly calculate the number of additional screens required.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

**Correctness: False**
