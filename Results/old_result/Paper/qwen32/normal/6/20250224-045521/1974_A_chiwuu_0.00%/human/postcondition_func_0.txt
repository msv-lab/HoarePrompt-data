The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates a value `t` based on specific conditions and prints this value. The purpose of the function is to process each pair of integers `a` and `b` and output a computed value `t` for each test case.
