The code snippet `a, b = input().split()` takes two inputs from the user and splits them into two separate variables `a` and `b`. This means the values of `a` and `b` will be updated to the new inputs provided by the user.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `t1`, `t2`, `t`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the new input, `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is greater than `k + 2`, `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `(b * 2)` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or `t + t2 // 15 + 1` otherwise.**
