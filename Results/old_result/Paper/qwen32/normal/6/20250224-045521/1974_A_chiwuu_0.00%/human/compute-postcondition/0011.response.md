Output State: **`t` is equal to `b * 2 // 5` if `t` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t` is equal to `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `a` is an integer converted from the string representing the first integer from the input; `b` is an integer converted from the string representing the second integer from the input; `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`.**

In natural language: The value of `t` remains as it was initially, determined by the conditions given. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they were derived from the input. A new variable `t1` is introduced and is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
