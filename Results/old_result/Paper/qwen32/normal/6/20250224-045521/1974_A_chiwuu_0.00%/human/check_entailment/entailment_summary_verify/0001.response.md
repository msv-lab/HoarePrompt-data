### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided Python program and compare it against the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Program Analysis:

1. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` (number of 1x1 icons) and `b` (number of 2x2 icons).

2. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The code calculates the number of screens required to place `b` 2x2 icons.
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Since each screen has 15 cells (5x3), the number of screens required for 2x2 icons (`t`) is calculated as:
     - `t = b * 2` (each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, which is 2 units of 2 cells each)
     - If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is divided by 5.
     - If `t` is not divisible by 5, `t` is divided by 5 and then rounded up by adding 1.
   - This logic is flawed. The correct approach should be to calculate the total number of cells required by 2x2 icons and then determine the number of screens needed. Specifically, `t` should be calculated as:
     - `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15` (this ensures that the total cells required by 2x2 icons are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 15).

3. **Calculating Remaining Space:**
   - The code calculates the remaining space available after placing the 2x2 icons:
     - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`
     - `t1` represents the remaining number of 1x1 cells available after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - This step is correct in the sense that it calculates the remaining cells, but the initial calculation of `t` is flawed.

4. **Calculating Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space `t1` is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`a`), no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1` is not sufficient, the code calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons (`t2 = a - t1`).
   - The additional screens required are then calculated:
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1`.
   - This logic is mostly correct, but it relies on the correct initial value of `t`.

#### Correct Approach:

- Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons correctly:
  - `t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15` (round up the total cells required by 2x2 icons to the nearest multiple of 15).
- Calculate the remaining cells:
  - `remaining_cells = t * 15 - b * 4`
- Calculate the additional screens required for 1x1 icons:
  - If `remaining_cells < a`, calculate the additional screens:
    - `additional_screens = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15` (round up the additional cells required to the nearest multiple of 15).
  - `t += additional_screens`
- Print the total number of screens `t` for each test case.

#### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly handle the placement of 2x2 icons, leading to incorrect results in some cases. Specifically, the calculation of the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is flawed.

**Final: False**
