The code snippet provided is `b = int(b)`, which means the variable `b` is being reassigned to the integer value of itself. Since `b` is already described as the second integer from the new input, converting it to an integer does not change its value. Therefore, the state of `b` remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, `a` is the first integer from the new input (converted to an integer), `b` is the second integer from the new input, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`.**
