The code snippet `a, b = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `a` and `b`. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each of the t test cases, there are two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. The values of `x` and `y` will be read from the input and assigned to `a` and `b` respectively.

Since `input().split()` splits the input into strings, `a` and `b` will be strings representing the two integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is a string representing the first integer from the input; `b` is a string representing the second integer from the input.**
