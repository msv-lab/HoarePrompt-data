The code modifies each element of the array `a` by adding the index of the element plus one to it. Therefore, the element at index `i` in the array `a` will be updated to `a[i] + i + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array `a`.

After the code execution, each element `a[i]` in the array `a` is updated to `a[i] + i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + i + 1`.**
