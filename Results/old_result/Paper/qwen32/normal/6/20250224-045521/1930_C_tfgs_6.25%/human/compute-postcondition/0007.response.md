The value of `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`. The values of `n` and other elements in the list `a` remain unchanged. Since `i` is initially `i + 1`, the specific index `i` in the list `a` is incremented by `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
