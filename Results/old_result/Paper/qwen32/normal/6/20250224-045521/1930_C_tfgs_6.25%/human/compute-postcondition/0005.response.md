The code `a[i] += i + 1` updates the element at index `i` in the list `a` by adding `i + 1` to its current value. Given that `a[i]` was previously updated to `a[i] + i + 1`, the new value of `a[i]` will be `a[i] + (i + 1) + (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `a[i] + 2 * (i + 1)`.

The value of `n` and the values of other elements in `a` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since `i` is not part of the list `a` itself, it doesn't affect the list directly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + 2 * (i + 1)`; `i` is incremented by 1**.
