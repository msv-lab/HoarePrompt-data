To determine the output state after the loop completes all iterations, we need to understand how the loop modifies the array `a`. The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration `i`, it increments the `i-th` element of `a` by `i + 1`.

Let's break down the transformation:
- After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `a[0]` is incremented by `0 + 1`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `a[1]` is incremented by `1 + 1`.
- After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `a[2]` is incremented by `2 + 1`.
- This pattern continues until the `n-th` iteration (`i = n-1`), where `a[n-1]` is incremented by `(n-1) + 1`.

Thus, after all iterations, each element `a[i]` will be updated to `a[i] + (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] + i + 1`.**

In simple terms, the output state is that for each element in the array `a`, its value is increased by its 1-based index.
