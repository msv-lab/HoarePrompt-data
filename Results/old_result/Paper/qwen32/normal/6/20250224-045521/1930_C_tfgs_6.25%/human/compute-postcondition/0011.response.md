The code sorts the list `a` in descending order. The values of `n` and `counter` remain unchanged. The list `a` will now be ordered from the largest to the smallest element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5); `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order; `counter` is a Counter object that holds the frequency of each element in the original updated list `a` and is no longer accurate for the current `a`.**
