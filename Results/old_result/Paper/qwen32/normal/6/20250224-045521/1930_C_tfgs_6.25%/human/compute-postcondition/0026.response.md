Postcondition: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5), `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object with decremented counts for the elements used in `ans` and, if `i > 0`, the count of `a[i - 1]` is decremented by `adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - len(ans) - adv` if `i > 0` otherwise `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, and `ans` is a list containing all the values appended during the loop. If `i > 0`, then `i` is equal to `len(a)` after the execution.**
