The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 because the `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `n`. Since `n` is already given as an integer in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0, and thus the loop will execute.

The variable `i` is the loop variable that will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `i` does not need to be initialized because it is set by the `range` function in the loop header.

The array `a` and its elements are not part of the loop header, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to have any meaningful effect, `a` should be a list of `n` integers as described.

Given the above, the state before the loop starts does not need any adjustment for the loop to execute, as `n` is already within the required range.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of array `a`**
