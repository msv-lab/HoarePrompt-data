### Reasoning:
The provided execution summary indicates that the function `func_1(num)` always returns 0, regardless of the input. This is incorrect based on the function's intended behavior. The function `func_1(num)` is supposed to count the number of trailing zeros in a given number (string representation).

Given the problem, the function `func_1(num)` should correctly count the trailing zeros in each number to determine how many digits can be potentially removed if a number is reversed. The logic of the program relies on this count to determine if Sasha or Anna wins.

However, since `func_1(num)` always returns 0, the program will not correctly account for the removal of trailing zeros when numbers are reversed. This will lead to incorrect calculations of `total_digits - subtract_zero` and, consequently, incorrect determinations of the winner.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
