The function `count_zero(num)` is not directly related to the problem description provided. However, based on the problem description, the input variables are: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of integers in the list (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `m` is an integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6) determining when Sasha wins. The list `a` contains `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
