Postcondition: **`num` is a list of integers with at least one element. If `num[i]` is equal to `'0'`, `counter` is either 2 or 3, and `i` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains 1, 2, or 0 based on whether the current element `num[i]` is `'0'`, and `i` is decremented by 1. If `counter` was set to 1 or 2 in the else part, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
