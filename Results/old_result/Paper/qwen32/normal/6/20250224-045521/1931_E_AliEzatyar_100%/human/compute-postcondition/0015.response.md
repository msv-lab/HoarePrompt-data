To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand the behavior of the loop and how it affects the `counter` and the index `i`.

The loop iterates over the list `num` in reverse order, starting from the last element down to the first. It checks if the current element is `'0'`. If it is, it increments the `counter`. If it encounters an element that is not `'0'`, it breaks out of the loop.

Given that the elements of `num` are integers (not strings), the comparison `num[i] == '0'` will always be `False` because `'0'` is a string and the elements are integers. Therefore, the `counter` will never be incremented, and the loop will break on the first iteration.

Since the loop will break on the first iteration, the output state after all iterations (which in this case is just the first iteration) will be:

- `counter` remains 0 because no elements in the list are equal to the string `'0'`.
- The index `i` will be decremented by 1 from its initial value, but since the loop breaks immediately, the exact value of `i` is not relevant to the final state of `counter`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **counter is 0.**
