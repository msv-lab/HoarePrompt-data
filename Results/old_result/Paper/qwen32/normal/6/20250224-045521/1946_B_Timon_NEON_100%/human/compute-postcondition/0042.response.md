The code assigns the value of `new_segment` to the variable `max_segment`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `segments_variants` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`, `segments_variants` has a new element added which is `new_segment` with `i - 1` appended to it, `max_segment` is `new_segment`.**
