Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum back into the array at any position. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` such operations and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Key Points
1. **Maximizing the Sum**: The optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the maximum possible subarray sum to the array, as this will maximize the total sum.
2. **Subarray Sum Calculation**: The maximum subarray sum can be found using Kadane's algorithm.
3. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) operations and arrays), the solution must be efficient.

### Code Analysis
Let's analyze the provided code functions:

1. **func_1(number)**: This function simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is useful for ensuring the result is within the required range.

2. **func_2(arr)**: This function is intended to find the maximum subarray sum and its indices. However, there are several issues:
   - The logic for maintaining `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly implement Kadane's algorithm.
   - The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as arrays with all negative numbers.
   - The final selection of `total_max_segment` is incorrect and does not guarantee the maximum subarray sum.

3. **func_3(number, quantity)**: This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It seems to be intended to perform the operations and compute the final result.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly:
- Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
- If the maximum subarray sum is positive, repeatedly add it to the array `k` times.
- If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the best strategy is to add zeros (effectively doing nothing) because adding a non-positive number will not increase the sum.
- Finally, compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution. The function `func_2` is flawed, and `func_3` is incomplete. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
