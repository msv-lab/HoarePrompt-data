Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1, `segments_variants` contains a new segment which is the result of appending `new_segment + [i - 1]` to it.**

Natural Language: The list `arr` remains unchanged. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. The list `segments_variants` now includes a new segment, which is formed by appending `new_segment` with the list containing `i - 1` to it.
