Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1, `segments_variants` contains a new segment which is the result of appending `new_segment + [i - 1]` to it, `max_segment` is equal to `new_segment`.**

In simple terms, the value of `max_segment` has been updated to be equal to `new_segment`. All other variables retain their previous states and values.
