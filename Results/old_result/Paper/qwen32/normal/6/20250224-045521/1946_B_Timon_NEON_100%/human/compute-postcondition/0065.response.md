The code assigns the value of `segment` to `total_max_segment`. Given that `segment` is `[another_segment]`, `total_max_segment` will also be `[another_segment]`.

Output State: **`arr` is [1, -2, 3, 4, -1], `new_segment` is [7, 2], `max_segment` is [7, 2], `segments_variants` is [[7, 2, 4], [another_segment]], `max_sum` is -1, `segment` is [another_segment], `total_max_segment` is [another_segment]**.
