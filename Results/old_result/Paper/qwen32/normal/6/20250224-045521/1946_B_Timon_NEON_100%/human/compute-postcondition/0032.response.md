The code snippet `max_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the first element of the list `max_segment` by the value of `arr[i]`. The value of `i` is already incremented by 1 before this line, so we use the value of `arr` at the new index `i`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1, `max_segment[0]` is the original `max_segment[0]` plus `arr[i]`.**
