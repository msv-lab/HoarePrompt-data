The code snippet modifies the `max_segment` list by adding the value of `arr[i]` to the first element of `max_segment`. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `new_segment` are not altered by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is `i + 1`. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[i], i]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains undefined. `max_segment[0]` is increased by `arr[i]`.**
