The code snippet assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. Therefore, `max_segment` now holds the same list of integers as `new_segment`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is not an empty list, `max_segment` is `new_segment`, `segments_variants` is a list containing `new_segment + [i - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1.**
