The provided code snippet contains a typo: `total_max_segment = segment`, where `segment` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming that the intention was to assign the value of `max_segment` to `total_max_segment`, I will proceed with this assumption.

Given the initial state and the corrected code:
```
total_max_segment = max_segment
```

The value of `total_max_segment` will be updated to the value of `max_segment`, which is `[7, 2]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`arr` is [1, -2, 3, 4, -1], `new_segment` is [7, 2], `max_segment` is [7, 2], `segments_variants` is [[7, 2, 4], [another_segment]], `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [7, 2]**
