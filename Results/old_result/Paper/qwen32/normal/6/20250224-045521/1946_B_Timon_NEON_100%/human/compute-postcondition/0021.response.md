The code snippet assigns `new_segment` the value of a list containing the current element `arr[i]` and the index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is `[arr[i], i]`, `max_segment` is `[0, 0]`, `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and the current element `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0.**
