### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program to determine if it meets the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an integer and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct as per the problem statement, which requires the output to be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous non-negative subarray in the input array `arr`. It iterates through the array, keeping track of the current segment sum (`new_segment`) and the maximum segment sum found so far (`max_segment`).
   - It also maintains a list of segment variants (`segments_variants`) to consider different possible segments.
   - After processing the array, it selects the segment with the maximum sum from `segments_variants` and returns it.
   - However, there is a flaw in the function: it does not correctly handle the case when all elements in the array are negative. The function should return a segment sum of 0 in such cases, but the current implementation might return a negative value or an incorrect segment.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum of a contiguous non-negative subarray.
   - If the maximum segment sum returned by `func_2` is -1 (which indicates that all elements are negative), it sets the maximum segment sum to 0.
   - It calculates the answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`, which is correct based on the problem description. The idea is to maximize the sum by repeatedly adding the maximum segment sum (which is doubled `k` times due to the nature of the operations).
   - Finally, it prints the result of `func_1(answer)` to ensure the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The main logic and `func_1` are correct. However, `func_2` has a flaw in handling cases where all elements in the array are negative. This flaw could lead to incorrect results in such cases. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
