The code snippet provided sets `new_segment` to an empty list. This change affects the `new_segment` variable, but does not affect `arr`, `max_sum`, `max_segment`, or `segments_variants`. The current element `arr[i]` remains unchanged as it is less than 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, then `max_segment` remains [0, 0] and `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, `i - 1`]]. Otherwise, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated to contain `new_segment + [i - 1]`. The current element `arr[i]` is less than 0 and remains unchanged.**
