The code snippet appends a new list to `segments_variants`. This new list is created by extending `max_segment` with an additional element, which is the length of `arr` minus 1. 

Given the initial state, `max_segment` is a list containing the maximum sum of any segment and its start index. The new element added to `segments_variants` will be `[max_segment[0], max_segment[1], len(arr) - 1]`.

The other variables (`arr`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is [original list of integers], `new_segment` is [sum of last non-negative segment, start index] or [], `max_segment` is [max sum of any segment, start index], `segments_variants` is [[sum of segment, start index], ..., [max_segment[0], max_segment[1], len(arr) - 1]], `max_sum` is -1.**
