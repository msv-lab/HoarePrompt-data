Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is incremented by 1. If `max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]`, then `segments_variants` has a new list appended to it, which is `max_segment + [i - 1]`. Otherwise, `segments_variants` contains a new segment which is the result of appending `new_segment + [i - 1]` to it, and `max_segment` is updated to be equal to `new_segment`.**
