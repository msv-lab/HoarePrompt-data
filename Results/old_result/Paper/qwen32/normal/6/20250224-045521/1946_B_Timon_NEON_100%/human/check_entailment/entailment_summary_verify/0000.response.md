### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the problem description, the code, and the function summaries.

1. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The code indeed contains three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`), but `func_3` is not implemented. The main logic for solving the problem should be in `func_3` or another function that is not provided. This is a significant issue as the core functionality is missing.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum subarray. However, it does not correctly handle cases where all elements are negative. The function should return the maximum sum subarray, but the current implementation does not handle negative sums correctly.
   - The function also does not return the correct format or value expected for further processing. It should return the sum of the maximum subarray, not the subarray itself with its indices.

3. **Lack of Main Function**:
   - There is no main function that ties all the logic together to read input, process each test case, and produce the correct output. This is crucial for solving the problem as described.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - `func_1` correctly implements the modulo operation, but it is not used in the provided code. The modulo operation is necessary to ensure the result is within the required constraints.

5. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle several edge cases, such as:
     - All elements being negative.
     - The array being empty.
     - The number of operations `k` being zero.
     - Large values of `n` and `k` as specified in the problem constraints.

### Evaluation:
Given the issues highlighted above, the provided code is incomplete and does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. The core functionality is missing, and the existing functions do not handle all necessary cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
