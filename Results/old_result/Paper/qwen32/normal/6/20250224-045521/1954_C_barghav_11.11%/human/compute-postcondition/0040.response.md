Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step-by-step:

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a list with at least two elements.
2. `b` is a list where the first half contains the minimum values and the second half contains the maximum values from the original `a` and `b` pairs.
3. `i` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end='')
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- The list `a` is stated to have at least two elements, but since `i` is 2, we need to ensure that `a` has at least three elements to avoid an `IndexError`.
- The value to be printed is `a[i]`, which translates to `a[2]` since `i` is 2.
- The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that no newline character will be added after the printed value.

### Conclusion:
The output will be the third element of the list `a` (since indexing starts from 0, `a[2]` is the third element).

### Output:
Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
