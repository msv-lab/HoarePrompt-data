Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `y` of the same length, where each digit is between 1 and 9, and rearranges their digits such that the first half of each resulting number consists of the maximum digits from the corresponding positions of `x` and `y`, while the second half consists of the minimum digits. It then prints the two rearranged numbers, each on a new line.**
