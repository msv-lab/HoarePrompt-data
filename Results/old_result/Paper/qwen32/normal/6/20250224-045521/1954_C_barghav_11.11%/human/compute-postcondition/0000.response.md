The code snippet provided reads an input and converts it into a list of characters. Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this line of code. The variable `a` is newly introduced and is assigned the value of the input converted into a list of characters.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; additionally, `x` and `y` have the same length for each test case; `a` is a list of characters representing the input.**
