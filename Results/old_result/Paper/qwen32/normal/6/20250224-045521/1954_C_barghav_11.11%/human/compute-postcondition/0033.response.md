Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000; for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both `x` and `y` consist only of digits from 1 to 9; additionally, `x` and `y` have the same length for each test case; `a` is a list of characters representing the input where `a[i]` is updated to the maximum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i <= len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `a[i]` is updated to the minimum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `b` is a list of characters representing the new input where `b[i]` is updated to the minimum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]` if `i <= len(a) // 2 - 1`, otherwise `b[i]` is updated to the maximum value between the original `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`; `n` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `m` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**
