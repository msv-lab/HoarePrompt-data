Let's analyze the given precondition and the print statement step by step.

**Initial State:**
- The concatenation of all elements in `a` and `b` must be a list with at least 1 element.
- `i` is 1.

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print(b[i], end='')
```

**Analysis:**
- We need to determine the value of `b[i]`.
- `i` is given as 1, so we need to find the element at index 1 of list `b`.
- The precondition states that the concatenation of `a` and `b` has at least 1 element, but it does not specify the lengths of `a` and `b` individually. However, since we are accessing `b[i]` where `i` is 1, `b` must have at least 2 elements.

Given that `i` is 1, `b[i]` refers to the second element of the list `b`.

**Output Description:**
- The print statement will output the second element of the list `b` without a newline at the end, due to `end=''`.

Since the exact elements of `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the element at index 1 of `b`.

Output: **b[1] (where b[1] is the second element of the list b)**
