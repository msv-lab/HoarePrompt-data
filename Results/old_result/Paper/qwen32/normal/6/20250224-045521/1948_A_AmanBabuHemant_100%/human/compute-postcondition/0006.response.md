The code snippet `s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)` creates a string `s` by repeating the substring `'AAB'` a number of times equal to `n // 2`. Since `n` is an even integer, `n // 2` will be an integer representing exactly half of `n`.

Given that `n` is even, the length of the string `s` will be `3 * (n // 2)` because each repetition of `'AAB'` adds 3 characters to the string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer, and `n` is even; `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
