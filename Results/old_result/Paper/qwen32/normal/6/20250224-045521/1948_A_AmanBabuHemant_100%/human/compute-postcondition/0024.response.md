The code snippet `n = int(input())` will overwrite the previous value of `n` with a new integer value provided by the user. The values of `t` and `s` (if it was defined) remain unchanged. The precondition for `t` (that `0 <= t - 2 <= 49`) is still valid as it does not depend on `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 2 <= 49; `n` is the new input integer.**
