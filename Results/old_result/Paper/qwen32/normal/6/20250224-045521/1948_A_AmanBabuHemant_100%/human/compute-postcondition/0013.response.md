Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50; `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, no additional changes are made to the variables. If `n` is even, `s` is a string consisting of the substring `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. If the length of `s` is less than 200, it remains less than 200; otherwise, the length of `s` is 200 or more.**
