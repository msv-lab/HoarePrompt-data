You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and for each of the t test cases, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` is 0 and no further test cases are processed. For each of the initial `t` test cases, the output is either 'NO' if `n` is odd, or 'YES' followed by the string `s` (which is 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times) if `n` is even and the length of `s` is less than 200. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, the output is 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd, in which case it outputs 'NO'. If `n` is even, it generates a string `s` by repeating 'AAB' `n // 2` times and outputs 'YES' followed by the string `s` if the length of `s` is less than 200. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it outputs 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to carefully analyze the problem requirements and the program's logic.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Special Characters Definition**: A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. For example, in the string "AAABAACC":
   - At position 1 ('A'), it is equal to its right neighbor ('A') but not its left neighbor (there is none).
   - At position 3 ('A'), it is equal to its left neighbor ('A') but not its right neighbor ('B').
   - At position 5 ('A'), it is equal to its right neighbor ('A') but not its left neighbor ('B').
   - At position 6 ('A'), it is equal to its left neighbor ('A') but not its right neighbor ('C').
   - At position 7 ('A'), it is equal to its left neighbor ('A') but not its right neighbor ('C').
   - At position 8 ('C'), it is equal to its left neighbor ('C') but not its right neighbor (there is none).

2. **Objective**: For each test case, we need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that it contains exactly `n` special characters, or determine if it's impossible to do so.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The number of test cases, `t`, is between 1 and 50.
   - The number of special characters, `n`, is between 1 and 50.
   - The length of the resulting string must be at most 200 characters.

### Program Analysis:
Let's break down the program's logic:
- The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
- If `n` is odd, the program prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each "A" in the middle of "AAB" is a special character, and there are exactly two special characters per "AAB" segment.
- The constructed string `s` is then checked to ensure its length is less than 200. If it is, the program prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length is 200 or more, it prints "NO".

### Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing "NO".
- The program correctly constructs a string with an even number of special characters when `n` is even.
- The constructed string "AAB" repeated `n // 2` times will always have a length of `3 * (n // 2)`, which is at most `3 * 25 = 75` for the maximum `n` of 50. Therefore, the length constraint of 200 is always satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The program satisfies all the requirements and constraints of the problem. Therefore, it is correct.
