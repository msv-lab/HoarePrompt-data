The code snippet assigns the variable `s` the value of the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= `t` - 1 <= 49; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string `'AAB'` repeated `n // 2` times.**
