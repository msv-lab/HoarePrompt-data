### Reasoning:
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case involves an integer \( n \). The task is to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly \( n \) special characters in the string. A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

The program's logic is as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \).
3. If \( n \) is odd, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in such a string configuration.
4. If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string consisting of the pattern "AAB" repeated \( n // 2 \) times. This pattern ensures that there are exactly \( n \) special characters in the string.
5. It checks if the length of the constructed string is less than 200. If so, it prints "YES" followed by the string; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The pattern "AAB" ensures that there are exactly 2 special characters in each repetition:
- The first 'A' is special because it is equal to the second 'A' but not to the 'B'.
- The second 'A' is special because it is equal to the first 'A' but not to the 'B'.
- The 'B' is not special because it is not equal to any of its neighbors.

Since each repetition of "AAB" contributes 2 special characters, repeating it \( n // 2 \) times results in exactly \( n \) special characters. Given that \( n \leq 50 \), the length of the string \( s \) is \( 3 \times (n // 2) \), which is at most \( 3 \times 25 = 75 \), well within the 200-character limit.

Therefore, the program correctly handles all possible inputs within the given constraints and produces the correct output.

### Correctness: **True**
