The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state provides information about variables `t`, `n`, and `s`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be exactly what the `print` statement specifies.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 50.
- `n` is an even integer.
- `s` is a string formed by repeating the substring `'AAB'` `n // 2` times, and its length is less than 200.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
