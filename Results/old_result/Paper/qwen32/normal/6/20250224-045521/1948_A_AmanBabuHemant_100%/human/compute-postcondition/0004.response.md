The given initial state provides some information about the variables `t` and `n`, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference these variables. Instead, it directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 50.
   - `n` is an input integer and `n` is odd.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code contains a single `print` statement: `print('NO')`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `print` statement outputs the string `'NO'` directly.
   - The variables `t` and `n` are not used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

4. **Output**:
   - Since the `print` statement does not depend on any variables and outputs the string `'NO'` directly, the output will be exactly `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
