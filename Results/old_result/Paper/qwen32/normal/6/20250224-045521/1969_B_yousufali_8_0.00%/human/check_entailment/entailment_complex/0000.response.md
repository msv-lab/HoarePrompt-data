Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring.

Upon analyzing the provided code, we can break down the logic as follows:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads a binary string as a list of integers.
   - Iterates through the list, counting the number of 1s encountered so far (`n`).
   - For each 0 encountered after at least one 1 has been encountered, it adds `n + 1` to the accumulated cost (`ans`).
   - The logic here is based on the observation that each time a 0 follows one or more 1s, the cost to "push" all the 1s before this 0 to the right by one position (effectively sorting the substring up to this point) is `n + 1`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case, which computes the required cost for each binary string and prints it.

The provided code correctly implements the logic described above. The cost calculation is based on the number of 1s that need to be shifted to the right of each 0 encountered after the first 1, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the example inputs and outputs, the code produces the correct results, confirming the logic and implementation.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
