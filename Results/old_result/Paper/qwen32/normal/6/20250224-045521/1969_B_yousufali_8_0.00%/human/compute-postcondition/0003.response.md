The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and should be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0**
