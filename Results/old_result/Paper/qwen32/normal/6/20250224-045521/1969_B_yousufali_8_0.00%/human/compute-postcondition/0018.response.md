The value of `ans` is increased by `n + 1`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged unless `n` was modified before this code snippet. Since the problem statement indicates that `n` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is 1, this condition should be considered in the context of the initial state. However, based on the given snippet alone, we only update `ans`.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least `i + 1` elements; `i` is unchanged; `n` is unchanged if `s[i]` was not 1, otherwise `n` is increased by 1 before this operation; `ans` is increased by `n + 1`.**
