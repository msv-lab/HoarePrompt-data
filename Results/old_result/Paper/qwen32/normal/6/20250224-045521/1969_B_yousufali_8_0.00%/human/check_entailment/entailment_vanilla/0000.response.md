Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring and minimizing the total cost. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r-l+1` is `r-l+1`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1`: This function is supposed to process a single binary string and calculate the minimum cost.
2. `func_2`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.

#### `func_1` Analysis
1. The function reads a binary string and converts it into a list of integers.
2. It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to store the total cost.
3. It iterates through the string:
   - If it encounters a '1', it increments `n`.
   - If it encounters a '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.

4. Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

#### `func_2` Analysis
- This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Correctness Check
Let's verify if the logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

**Key Insight:**
- To sort a binary string, all '1's need to be moved to the right of all '0's.
- The cost to move a '1' past a '0' is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one (the cost of the cyclic shift).

### Example Walkthrough
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement: `101011`.

- Initially, `n = 0` and `ans = 0`.
- First character is '1': `n = 1`.
- Second character is '0': `ans = 1 + 1 = 2` (move the '1' past the '0').
- Third character is '1': `n = 2`.
- Fourth character is '0': `ans = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5` (move the two '1's past the '0').
- Fifth character is '1': `n = 3`.
- Sixth character is '1': `n = 4`.

The total cost is `5`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion
The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
