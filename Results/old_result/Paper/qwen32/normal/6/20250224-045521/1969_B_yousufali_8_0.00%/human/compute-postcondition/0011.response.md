The code snippet `n += 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Given the initial state, `n` can either be 0 or 1. If `n` was 0, it will become 1. If `n` was 1, it will become 2. The values of `s`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and `s` must have at least 1 element; `n` is either 1 or 2; `ans` is 2 if the current element `s[i]` is 0 and `n` was not 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0; `i` is incremented by 1**.
