To accurately determine the output state, we need to know the definition of the function `func_1()`. Since the function definition is not provided, we can only infer that `func_1()` has been called, and we need to consider the impact of this function on the variables.

Given the initial state only mentions that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, and no other variables are mentioned, we can assume that `func_1()` does not affect `t` unless specified otherwise. Since there is no information about what `func_1()` does, we can only conclude that `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1.**
