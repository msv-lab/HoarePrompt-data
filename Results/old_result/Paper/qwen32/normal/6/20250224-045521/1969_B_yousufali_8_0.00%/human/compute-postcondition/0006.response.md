The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 to reflect the value before the increment, and then incremented again to proceed to the next iteration.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `t` is greater than 0 and `t` is incremented by 1.
- Before the increment, `t` was `t - 1`.
- After the increment, `t` becomes `t`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be `t` (the value before the increment) + 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1**
