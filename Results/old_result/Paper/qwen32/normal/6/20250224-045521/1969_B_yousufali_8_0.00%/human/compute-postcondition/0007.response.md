To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of calling `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided initial state or code snippet. Without the definition of `func_1()`, we cannot determine how it affects the variables or if it returns any value.

Given the lack of information about `func_1()`, we can only assume that `func_1()` does not modify `t` or introduce any new variables based on the information provided. If `func_1()` does not alter `t` and does not return a value, the state remains unchanged except for the fact that the function has been called.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `func_1()` has been called.**
