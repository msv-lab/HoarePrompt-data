Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` reads the input string as a list of integers using `input().split()`, which is incorrect because `input().split()` will split the input string by spaces, and binary strings are not space-separated. Instead, the input should be read as a single string and then processed accordingly.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**: The logic in `func_1()` to calculate the cost is not correct. The provided logic does not properly account for the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The current logic seems to be counting the number of 1s before each 0 and adding `n + 1` to the answer, which does not align with the problem's requirements for calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.

Here's a brief outline of a correct approach:

- Traverse the string to determine the transition points from 1 to 0.
- For each transition from 1 to 0, calculate the cost of shifting the substring to sort it. The cost is determined by the length of the substring that needs to be shifted.
- Sum up the costs for all necessary shifts to get the total minimum cost.

The current implementation does not follow this approach and thus does not solve the problem correctly.
