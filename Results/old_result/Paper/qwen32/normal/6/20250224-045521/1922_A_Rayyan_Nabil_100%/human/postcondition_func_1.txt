The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20. It then processes these strings and prints "increasing" if `a` is lexicographically smaller than `b` and `b` is lexicographically smaller than `c`, "decreasing" if `a` is lexicographically larger than `b` and `b` is lexicographically larger than `c`, and "neither" in all other cases.
