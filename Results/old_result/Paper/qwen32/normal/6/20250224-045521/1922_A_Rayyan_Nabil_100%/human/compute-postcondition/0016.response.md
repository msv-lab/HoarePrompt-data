The code snippet `a = input().strip()` reads a new input string from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters (as provided by the user), `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
