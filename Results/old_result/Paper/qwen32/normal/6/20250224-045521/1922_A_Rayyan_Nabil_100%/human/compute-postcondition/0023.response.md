The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, which is used to iterate over the `results` list. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least one more element after the current iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the input integer from the last iteration
- `a` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration
- `b` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration
- `c` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration
- `t` is the input integer greater than 0
- `results` is a list containing at least one element

We need to adjust the `results` list to have at least one more element for the loop to execute again. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` is the input integer from the last iteration, `a` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `b` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `c` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `t` is the input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing at least two elements**
