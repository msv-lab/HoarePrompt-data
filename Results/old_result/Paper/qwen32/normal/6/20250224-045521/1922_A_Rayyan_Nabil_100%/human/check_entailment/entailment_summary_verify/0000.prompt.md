You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20. It then processes these strings and prints "increasing" if `a` is lexicographically smaller than `b` and `b` is lexicographically smaller than `c`, "decreasing" if `a` is lexicographically larger than `b` and `b` is lexicographically larger than `c`, and "neither" in all other cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The problem requires determining whether there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template while string `c` does not match it. 

The provided function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'. However, this logic is not sufficient to ensure that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not match it for all positions.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, then we can choose a template character that matches both `a[i]` and `b[i]` but does not match `c[i]`.

Here is an example where the current program fails:
```
Input:
1
2
ab
ab
aa

Output:
YES

Expected Output:
NO
```

In this example, `a` and `b` are both "ab", and `c` is "aa". There is no template that can match both "ab" while not matching "aa" at both positions. The current program incorrectly returns "YES" because at position 1, `a[1] != c[1]` and `b[1] != c[1]`, but this does not ensure that a valid template exists that matches `a` and `b` while not matching `c`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then there should be a character that matches both `a[i]` and `b[i]` but does not match `c[i]`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if a[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
        else:
            if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

This corrected function ensures that for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the template to be valid.
