The code snippet provided is `n = int(input().strip())`. This line of code reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts the input to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. However, the initial state already specifies that `n` is an input integer greater than 0. This means that executing this line of code would overwrite the existing value of `n` with a new input value.

Since the task is to simulate the execution of the code and provide the output state, we need to consider that `n` will be reassigned to whatever integer value is provided by the new input. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 1, and `results` is a list containing one element, which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.
