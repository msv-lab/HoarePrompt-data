Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. The function `func_1` checks if there is at least one position where both characters in `a` and `b` are different from the character in `c`. However, this is not sufficient to ensure that there exists a template that matches the conditions for all positions.

The correct approach should be to check for each position if it is possible to construct a template that satisfies the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` at that position. Specifically, for each position `i`:
- If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (which is also `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, then we can choose `t[i]` to be either the uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`, and ensure that `c[i]` does not match the chosen character.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if a[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
        else:
            if c[i] == a[i] and c[i] == b[i]:
                return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected function checks each position to ensure that a valid template can be constructed.
