The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`, which iterates over the elements in the list `results`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `results` and how the loop progresses.

Given:
- `n` is the input integer from the last iteration.
- `a` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration.
- `b` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration.
- `c` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration.
- `t` is the input integer greater than 0.
- `results` is a list containing at least two elements.

At the end of the previous iteration, `result` was the second element of `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least three elements, and `result` will be the third element of `results`.

State: **`n` is the input integer from the last iteration, `a` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `b` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `c` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `t` is the input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing at least three elements**.
