Output State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing three elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**

In simpler terms, after the code is executed, the variable `results` will now contain three elements, each being the return value of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
