The only object in the loop head is the variable `result`. The loop will execute if `results` is a list with at least one element. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `results` must contain at least one element. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `t` are not directly involved in the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

State: **`n` is the input integer from the last iteration, `a` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `b` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `c` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `t` is the input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing at least one element**
