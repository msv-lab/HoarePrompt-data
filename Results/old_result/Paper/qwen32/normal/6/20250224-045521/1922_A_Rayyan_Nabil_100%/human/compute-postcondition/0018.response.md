The code snippet provided changes the value of the variable `c` by taking a new input from the user and stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the new input string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters (as provided by the user), `t` is an input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**.

In simpler terms, the variable `c` has been updated to a new string input by the user, while all other variables retain their initial values.
