Output State: **`n` is the input integer from the last iteration, `a` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `b` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `c` is the string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters from the last iteration, `t` is the input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration. The loop has finished executing all `t` iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their last iteration values. The variable `t` remains the same as the input integer greater than 0, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each of the `t` iterations. The loop has executed exactly `t` times.
