In the given task, the for loop is defined as:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which determines how many times the loop will execute. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The current state specifies that `t` is an input integer, but it does not specify its value. Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be greater than 0.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, and `results` is an empty list.**
