### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template while string `c` does not match it. The template string `t` can have lowercase or uppercase letters, and the matching rules are:
- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be the same as the i-th letter of the template.
- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th letter of the template.

The provided program checks if there is any position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it means we can construct a template where `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template (by using an uppercase letter in the template), and `c[i]` does not match the template (since `c[i]` would have to match a lowercase letter in the template, which is different from `a[i]` and `b[i]`). If no such position exists, then it's impossible to construct such a template.

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:
- The function iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i]` is different from `c[i]` and `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`.
- If both conditions are true for any position `i`, the function returns 'YES'.
- If the loop completes without finding such a position, the function returns 'NO'.

This logic correctly implements the problem's requirements. The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case and collecting the results, which are then printed.
