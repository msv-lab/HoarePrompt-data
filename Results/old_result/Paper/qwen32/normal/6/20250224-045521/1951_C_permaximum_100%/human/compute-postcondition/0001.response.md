The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place, maintaining the heap property. This means that the smallest element is at the root of the heap, which is the first element of the list `pq`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the `heapq.heapify` function.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list.**
