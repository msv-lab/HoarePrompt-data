The code snippet `price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)` removes the smallest tuple from the heap `pq` and assigns its elements to `price` and `day`. 

Given that `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is `(price, index)`, the smallest tuple by price is popped, meaning `price` will be the smallest price in the heap, and `day` will be the corresponding index from the `prices` list. This operation also modifies the heap `pq` by removing the popped element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0, `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`, `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list.**
