The `heapq.heappop(pq)` operation removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `pq`. This element is a tuple containing the smallest `price` and its corresponding `day` index from the `prices` list.

Given this, the `price` variable is updated to the smallest price from the `pq` heap, and the `day` variable is updated to the index of that price in the `prices` list.

Here is the updated state of the variables after the `heapq.heappop(pq)` operation:

- `price` is now the smallest price from the `pq` heap.
- `day` is now the index corresponding to that smallest price in the `prices` list.
- `pq` has one less element, as the smallest element has been popped.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, `price_increase`, `tickets_to_buy`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9); `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heapified list of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list excluding the smallest price tuple and the tuple that was just popped; `total_cost` is `total_cost + price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `2 * min(m, k) - 2`; `price_increase` is `min(m, k) + tickets_to_buy`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` after the pop; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list after the pop; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`**.
