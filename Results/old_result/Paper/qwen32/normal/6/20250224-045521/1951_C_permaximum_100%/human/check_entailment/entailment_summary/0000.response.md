Reasoning:  
The provided program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always purchase tickets from the day with the currently lowest price, which is a greedy strategy. This approach ensures that the tickets are bought at the minimum possible cost given the constraints. The program correctly handles the price increase mechanism by updating the price increase value after each purchase and reinserting the updated price back into the heap for future consideration. The loop continues until the required number of tickets `k` is purchased. The function correctly calculates and returns the total cost.

The program adheres to the problem constraints and logic:
- It ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any given day.
- It correctly increases the price for subsequent days based on the number of tickets bought on the current day.
- It efficiently handles the input constraints, including multiple test cases.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correctly implemented.

Correctness: **True**
