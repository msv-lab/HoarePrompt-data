### Reasoning:

To determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after making a cut, we need to analyze the problem carefully. Bob can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically, and then try to form another rectangle using the resulting pieces. 

Let's consider the possible scenarios:

1. **Cutting Horizontally:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle horizontally, he gets two smaller rectangles with dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) if \(b\) is even.
   - These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b/2\) or \((a \times 2) \times \frac{b}{2}\), which is essentially the same as \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\).

2. **Cutting Vertically:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle vertically, he gets two smaller rectangles with dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) if \(a\) is even.
   - These two rectangles can be combined to form a new rectangle of dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) or \(\frac{a}{2} \times (b \times 2)\), which is essentially the same as \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) or \(\frac{a \times 2}{2} \times b\).

From the above scenarios, we can infer that Bob can form another rectangle if at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even. This is because only then can he cut the rectangle into two equal parts and rearrange them into a new rectangle.

However, the given function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. This is not a complete solution because it does not account for the case where `a` is even.

### Correctness:

Given the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, it does not correctly handle cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd. For example, for a rectangle of size \(2 \times 1\), the function would return 'no' even though Bob can cut it into two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles and form a \(1 \times 2\) rectangle.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Your response:

Reasoning: The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even and does not account for the case where `a` is even. Thus, it does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
Correctness: **False**
