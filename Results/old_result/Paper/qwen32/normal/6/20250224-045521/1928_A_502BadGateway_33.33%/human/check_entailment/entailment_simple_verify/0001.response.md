Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The problem states that Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) and wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. These two smaller rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle is considered different from the original if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original.

### Key Observations
1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**
   - If the rectangle is cut parallel to the side of length \(a\), the two resulting rectangles will have dimensions \(a \times x\) and \(a \times (b - x)\) for some integer \(x\).
   - If the rectangle is cut parallel to the side of length \(b\), the two resulting rectangles will have dimensions \(y \times b\) and \((a - y) \times b\) for some integer \(y\).

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - For the two resulting rectangles to form a new rectangle, their combined area must equal \(a \times b\).
   - The dimensions of the new rectangle can be derived from the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles. For example, if the two smaller rectangles have dimensions \(a \times x\) and \(a \times (b - x)\), they can be rearranged to form a rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\), which is not new.
   - However, if the two smaller rectangles have dimensions \(a \times x\) and \(a \times (b - x)\), and \(x\) is such that \(x \neq \frac{b}{2}\), they can potentially form a new rectangle. Specifically, if \(b\) is even, they can be rearranged to form a rectangle of dimensions \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\), which is different from the original when considering rotations.

### Program Analysis
The provided program checks if \(b\) is even and returns "yes" if it is, otherwise "no". This logic is based on the observation that if \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) and \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\), which can be rearranged to form a new rectangle of dimensions \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\).

However, this logic is incomplete. The problem is symmetric with respect to \(a\) and \(b\). Therefore, the program should also check if \(a\) is even, not just \(b\). If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Correct Program Logic
The correct logic should be:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, print "yes".
- Otherwise, print "no".

### Conclusion
The original program only checks if \(b\) is even, which is not sufficient. It should also check if \(a\) is even. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
