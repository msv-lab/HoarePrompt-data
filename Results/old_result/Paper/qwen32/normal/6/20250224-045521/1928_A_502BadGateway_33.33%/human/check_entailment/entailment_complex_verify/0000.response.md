### Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect. The program only checks if `b` is even, which is not a sufficient condition to determine if Bob can form another rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces.

Let's break down the problem again:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle**:
   - Bob can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically.
   - If he cuts it horizontally, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles will be `(a/2, b)` and `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even.
   - If he cuts it vertically, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles will be `(a, b/2)` and `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even.

2. **Forming Another Rectangle**:
   - The two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form another rectangle if the dimensions of the smaller rectangles allow it.
   - For example, if the original rectangle is `2x6`, cutting it vertically into two `2x3` rectangles can be rearranged to form a `4x3` rectangle.

The given program only checks if `b` is even, which is incorrect because:
- It does not consider the possibility of cutting horizontally.
- It does not correctly account for all cases where rearrangement is possible.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if either dimension can be evenly divided, and if so, whether the resulting smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle. The correct logic should consider both dimensions (`a` and `b`).

Here is the correct approach:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, then it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment accurately identified that the provided program is incorrect. Therefore, we should maintain the original assessment.

**Final: False**
