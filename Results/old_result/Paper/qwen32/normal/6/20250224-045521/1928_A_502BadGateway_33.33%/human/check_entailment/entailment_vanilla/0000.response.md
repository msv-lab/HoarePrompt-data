Reasoning:
The problem requires us to determine if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles of integer sides, and then those two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is not identical to the original (considering rotations as the same).

Let's analyze the logic in the provided program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
3. It then checks if \(b\) is even using the condition `b % 2 == 0`.
4. If \(b\) is even, it prints "yes"; otherwise, it prints "no".

The key point here is to understand when a new rectangle can be formed. If the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and those two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle, it means that one of the dimensions of the original rectangle must be even. This is because:

- If \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\). These two rectangles can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\). Since rotations are considered the same, this is a different rectangle from the original.
- If \(b\) is odd, the rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles of sizes \(a \times 1\) and \(a \times (b-1)\). These two rectangles cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original when considering rotations.

The provided program correctly implements this logic. It only checks if \(b\) is even, which is sufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. The program does not need to check \(a\) because the problem is symmetric with respect to \(a\) and \(b\).

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
