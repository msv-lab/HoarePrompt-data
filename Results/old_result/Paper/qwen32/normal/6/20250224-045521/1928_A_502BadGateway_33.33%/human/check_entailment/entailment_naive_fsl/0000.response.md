Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle by cutting the given rectangle into two and rearranging them. The current implementation only checks if one of the dimensions (`b`) is even, which is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Cutting the Rectangle**:
   - Bob can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically.
   - If he cuts it horizontally, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles will be `(a/2, b)` and `(a/2, b)` if `a` is even.
   - If he cuts it vertically, the dimensions of the two smaller rectangles will be `(a, b/2)` and `(a, b/2)` if `b` is even.

2. **Forming Another Rectangle**:
   - The two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form another rectangle if the dimensions of the smaller rectangles allow it.
   - For example, if the original rectangle is `2x6`, cutting it vertically into two `2x3` rectangles can be rearranged to form a `4x3` rectangle.

The given program only checks if `b` is even, which is incorrect because:
- It does not consider the possibility of cutting horizontally.
- It does not correctly account for all cases where rearrangement is possible.

Let's consider a counterexample:
- For a rectangle of size `4x3`, cutting it vertically into two `4x1.5` rectangles is not possible since dimensions must be integers.
- However, cutting it horizontally into two `2x3` rectangles can be rearranged to form a `3x4` rectangle, which is different from the original `4x3` rectangle.

Thus, the program is incorrect for at least this case and possibly others.

**Counterexample:**
Input:
```
1
4 3
```
Expected Output:
```
Yes
```
Actual Output (from the given program):
```
No
```

Hence, the program is incorrect.
