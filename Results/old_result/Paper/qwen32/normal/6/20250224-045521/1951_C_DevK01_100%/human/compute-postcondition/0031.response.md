The code `w = N.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the list `N`. This means that `w` will be assigned the value of the last element of `N`, and `N` will have one less element than it did before.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1.
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input line.
- `n` is the length of `N`.
- `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.
- `k` is `L[2]`.
- `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
- `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.

After `w = N.pop()`, the last element of `N` is removed and assigned to `w`. The length of `N` is now `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input line; `n` is the length of `N` minus 1; `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of the original `N`.**
