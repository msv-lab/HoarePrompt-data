The code sorts the list `M`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. The list `L` also remains unchanged. The list `M` is now sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is `L[0]`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.**
