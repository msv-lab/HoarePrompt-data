```
N = M[:q]
```

The code snippet assigns the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` to the new list `N`. The value of `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k` divided by `m`, where `k` is `L[2]` and `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input line; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is the first `q` elements of `M`.**
