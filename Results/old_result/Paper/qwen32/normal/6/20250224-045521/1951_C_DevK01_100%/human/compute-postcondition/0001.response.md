The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if and only if `t` is greater than 0. The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` do not affect whether the loop will execute or not, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 Â· 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and min(nm, 10^9), the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9**
