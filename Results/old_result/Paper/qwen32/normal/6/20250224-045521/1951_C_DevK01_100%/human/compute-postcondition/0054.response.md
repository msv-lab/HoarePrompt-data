Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input string; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input string; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `n` is `len(M[:q-1])`, `N` is `M[:q-1]`, `w` is `M[q-1]`, `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
