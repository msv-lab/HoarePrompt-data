The code provided reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list named `M`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 Â· 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and min(nm, 10^9), the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `M` is a list of integers read from the input.**
