You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Output

    10
    64

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue is in how it calculates the cost of purchasing tickets. The given program assumes that the best strategy is to always buy the maximum number of tickets (m) on the cheapest available days, which is not necessarily true due to the price increase mechanism.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Input:
```
1
5 2 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Expected Output:
```
8
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
- Buy 2 tickets on day 1 for a total cost of 2 (prices become [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]).
- Buy 2 tickets on day 2 for a total cost of 8 (prices become [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]).
- Total cost: 2 + 6 = 8.

### Actual Output from the Program:
The program might output a different result because it does not consider the optimal strategy of spreading out the purchases to minimize the price increases.

### Example Input:
```
1
6 3 9
5 5 5 5 5 5
```

### Expected Output:
```
72
```

### Explanation of Expected Output:
- Buy 3 tickets on day 1 for a total cost of 15 (prices become [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]).
- Buy 3 tickets on day 2 for a total cost of 24 (prices become [11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11]).
- Buy 3 tickets on day 3 for a total cost of 33 (prices become [14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14]).
- Total cost: 15 + 24 + 33 = 72.

### Actual Output from the Program:
The program might output a different result because it does not consider the optimal strategy of spreading out the purchases to minimize the price increases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always find the optimal solution for purchasing tickets with the minimum cost. It makes assumptions about the best strategy that do not hold in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
