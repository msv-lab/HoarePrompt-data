The code snippet `M.sort()` sorts the list `M` in ascending order. This affects the list `M` directly, but does not change the values of `t`, `L`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. The sorted list `M` is the only change in the state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `M` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the new input line; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`; `k` is `L[2]`.**
