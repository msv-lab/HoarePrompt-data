The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect any variables or the state of the program outside of the loop. Since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the program state.

Therefore, none of the variables are altered, and the program state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `n` is `q-1`. `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M` after removing the last element, and `w` is the last element that was removed from `N` if `n * m != k`. `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m` if `n * m != k`. `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
