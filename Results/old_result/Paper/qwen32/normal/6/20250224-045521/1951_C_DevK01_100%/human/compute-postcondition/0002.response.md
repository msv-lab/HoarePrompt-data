The code snippet assigns a new list `L` by reading a line of input, splitting it into components, and converting each component to an integer. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or the initial list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The new list `L` is created based on the input provided.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 Â· 10^5, `m` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 1 and min(nm, 10^9), the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `L` is a list of integers read from the input.**
