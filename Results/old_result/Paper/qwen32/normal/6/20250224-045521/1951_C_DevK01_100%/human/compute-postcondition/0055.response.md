To determine the exact output of the `print(cost)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the variables involved.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: It is defined as `t - 1`, but since `t` is not explicitly given, we'll assume `t` is an integer and this operation is performed on it.
2. **L**: A list of integers obtained from an input string.
3. **M**: A sorted list of integers obtained from a new input string.
4. **m**: The minimum value between the second and third elements of `L` (i.e., `min(L[1], L[2])`).
5. **k**: The third element of `L` (i.e., `L[2]`).
6. **q**: The ceiling of `k / m` (i.e., `int(math.ceil(k / m))`).
7. **n**: This variable is determined based on the condition `n * m == k`.
   - If `n * m == k`, then `N` is the first `q` elements of `M` (`M[:q]`), and `cost` is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `n` is the length of the first `q-1` elements of `M` (`len(M[:q-1])`), `N` is the first `q-1` elements of `M` (`M[:q-1]`), `w` is the `q`-th element of `M` (`M[q-1]`), `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost` is calculated as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine `m`**: `m = min(L[1], L[2])`.
2. **Determine `k`**: `k = L[2]`.
3. **Determine `q`**: `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`.
4. **Determine `n`**:
   - If `n * m == k`, then `N = M[:q]` and `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `n = len(M[:q-1])`, `N = M[:q-1]`, `w = M[q-1]`, `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`, and `cost = mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

### Output Description:
The value of `cost` depends on the specific values of `L` and `M`. Since we don't have the exact values of `L` and `M`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cost`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the value of `cost` in terms of the variables and conditions given.

### Final Output:
Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the conditions and values of L and M as described above)**
