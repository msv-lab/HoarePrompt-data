The code snippet `w = N.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `N`. Therefore, the variable `w` is assigned the value of the last element of `N`, and `N` itself will have one less element than it did before.

Given the initial state, `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`. After the `pop` operation, `N` will be missing its last element, but `q` and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`, `m` is the minimum of `L[1]` and `L[2]`, `k` is `L[2]`, the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` consists of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, `L` is a list of integers read from the input, `M` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`, `N` is the first `q-1` elements of the sorted list `M` after removing the last element, and `w` is the last element that was removed from `N`.**
