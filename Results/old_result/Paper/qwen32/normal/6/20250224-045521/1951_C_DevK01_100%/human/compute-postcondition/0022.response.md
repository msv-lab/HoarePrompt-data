The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `L`. The variable `t` is not directly affected by this code snippet, except for the precondition that it is an input integer greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer greater than 0 and decremented by 1; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
