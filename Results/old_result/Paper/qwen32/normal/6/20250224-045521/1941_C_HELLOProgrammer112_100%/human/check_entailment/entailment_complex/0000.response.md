Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in each test case string `s` and then calculating the result as `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of "map", `y` is the count of "pie", and `z` is the count of "mapie". However, this approach is flawed because it assumes that counting non-overlapping occurrences and subtracting the overlap of "mapie" will give the correct minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

The issue arises because:
1. The counts of "map" and "pie" may overlap in ways that are not accounted for by simply counting "mapie". For example, in the string "mappie", the "map" and "pie" overlap in a way that is not captured by counting "mapie".
2. The program does not consider the possibility of removing characters in a way that avoids creating new "map" or "pie" substrings, which could result in a lower number of deletions than simply counting and subtracting.

Thus, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
