In the given task, the for loop is controlled by the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will iterate `t` times. The variables `n` and `s` are defined inside the loop and are not part of the loop head, so we cannot adjust them to make the loop execute. We can only adjust `t` to ensure the loop runs as intended.

Let's analyze the loop head:

```
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head only involves the variable `_` (which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan to use) and the `range` function, which is controlled by the integer value obtained from `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the value of `t` (which is the number of test cases) must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts must ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
