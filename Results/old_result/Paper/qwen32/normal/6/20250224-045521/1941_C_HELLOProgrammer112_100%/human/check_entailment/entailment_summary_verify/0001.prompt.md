You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, subtracts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'mapie', and prints the result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program attempts to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from the string `s` to make it beautiful by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". However, the approach taken in the program is incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Counting Overlaps**: The program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" but does not handle overlapping occurrences correctly. For example, in the string "mappie", the substring "map" and "pie" overlap, and the program does not account for this overlap properly.

2. **Counting "mapie"**: The program also counts the occurrences of "mapie", which is unnecessary and incorrect. The presence of "mapie" does not directly help in determining the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

3. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `x + y - z` does not correctly calculate the minimum deletions required. It does not account for the fact that removing characters to eliminate one occurrence of "map" or "pie" might also eliminate parts of another occurrence.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach would be more suitable. The idea would be to use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of deletions required to make the substring `s[0:i]` beautiful. This approach would correctly handle overlapping substrings and provide the correct answer.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
