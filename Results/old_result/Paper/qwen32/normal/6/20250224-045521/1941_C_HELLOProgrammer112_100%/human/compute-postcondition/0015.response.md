The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are not affected by this input operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is the new input integer; `s` is the new input string; `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in the new `s`; `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in the new `s`; `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in the new `s`**.
