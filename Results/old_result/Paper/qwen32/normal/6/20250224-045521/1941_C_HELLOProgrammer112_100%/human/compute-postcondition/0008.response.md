Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an input integer; `s` is the value of the input string; `x` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'pie' in `s`; `z` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie' in `s`**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to the integer value provided by the input. The values of all other variables (`t`, `s`, `x`, `y`, and `z`) remain unchanged.
