Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. The problem requires finding the minimum number of deletions to remove all occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map". The provided program only counts the occurrences of "map", "pie", and "mapie" and then attempts to compute the deletions, but it does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters.

To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm that carefully considers the removal of characters to avoid counting overlaps multiple times would be necessary. The current solution does not handle these cases correctly.
