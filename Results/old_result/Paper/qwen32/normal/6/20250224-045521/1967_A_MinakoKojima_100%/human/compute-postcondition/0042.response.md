Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n - 1]`, `i` is `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language explanation: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
