The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The `ans_list` remains an empty list as it is not modified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list.**

In simpler terms, `t` and `n` retain their initial values, `k` retains its value read from the input, `a` is now a list of integers read from the input, and `ans_list` is still an empty list.
