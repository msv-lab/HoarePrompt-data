Postcondition: **`ans` is the final incremented value plus `k // n` if `k` is not 0. `res` is the remaining differences not covered by `k` plus `k % n` if `k` is not 0. `k` is 0 or the remaining amount, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans` if `k` is not 0, `a` and `dif` remain unchanged.**
