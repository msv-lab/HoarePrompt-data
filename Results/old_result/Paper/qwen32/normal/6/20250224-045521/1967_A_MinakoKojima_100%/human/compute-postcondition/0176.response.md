The `break` statement in the code does not change any of the variable values; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `ans`, `res`, `ans_list`, `a`, `dif`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1; `k` is 0; `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `a` plus `k // (i + 2)`; `res` is `n - 1`; `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`; `i` is `i + 1`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables.
