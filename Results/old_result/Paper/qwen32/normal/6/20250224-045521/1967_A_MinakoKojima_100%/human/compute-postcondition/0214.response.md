Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the sorted list `a`. The result is derived by adjusting the smallest element in the list and distributing `k` across the differences between consecutive elements, then adding additional calculations based on the remaining `k` and the number of unique differences.**
