Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `ans` is `a[0]`.**

In simple terms: The variable `ans` is now assigned the value of the first element of the sorted list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
