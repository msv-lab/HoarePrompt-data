Output State: **`ans` is `a[0] + dif`, `res` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`, `ans_list` contains `ans`, `n` is at least 2, `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input, and `dif` is not 0.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is decremented by 1, so `res` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
