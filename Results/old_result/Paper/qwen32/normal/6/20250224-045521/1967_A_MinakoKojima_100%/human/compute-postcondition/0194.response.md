Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, and `res` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement without changing the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, or `res`. The value of `i` remains as `i + 1` as it was calculated before the `break` statement.
