Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `k`, `ans`, `res`, `a`, and `ans_list` remain unchanged; `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.**

In natural language: The value of `dif` is now the difference between the elements at index `i + 1` and `i` of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
