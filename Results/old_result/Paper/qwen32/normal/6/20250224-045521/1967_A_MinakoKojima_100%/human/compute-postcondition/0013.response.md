Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `k` is an integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, and `dif` is not 0. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)` indicating that the current value of `k` satisfies the if condition.**
