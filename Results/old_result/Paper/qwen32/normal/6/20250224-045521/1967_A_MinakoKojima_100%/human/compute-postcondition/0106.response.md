Postcondition: **`ans` is `a[0] + k // 4 + k // 5` if `dif` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `a[0]`. `res` is `n - 3 + k % 5` if `dif` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 2 + k % 4 + k % 5`. `ans_list` contains the updated `ans`. `n` is at least 2. `k` is 0 if `dif` is not 0, otherwise it retains its initial value. `a` is the sorted list of integers read from the input. `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`. `i` is 4.**
