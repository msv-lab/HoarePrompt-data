Output State: **`ans` is the final incremented value plus `k // n`, `res` is the remaining differences not covered by `k` plus `k % n`, `k` is not 0, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, `a` and `dif` remain unchanged.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `res` is updated by adding `k % n` to it. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
