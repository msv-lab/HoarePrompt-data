The code snippet calculates the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` and assigns it to the variable `dif`. The index `i` is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, but based on the context, it is assumed that `i` is a valid index for accessing elements in the list `a`.

Given that `a` is a sorted list of integers, `dif` will be the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `ans`, `res`, `ans_list`) are not directly affected by this particular line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the first element of the sorted list `a`, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`.**
