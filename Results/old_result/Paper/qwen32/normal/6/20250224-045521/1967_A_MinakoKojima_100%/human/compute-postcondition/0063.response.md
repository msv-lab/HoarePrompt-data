Output State: **`ans` is the maximum possible value it can take based on the available `k` and the differences in the list `a` plus `k // n`; `res` is 0 if `k` was sufficient to cover all differences, otherwise it is adjusted based on the remaining `k` value; the current value of `k` is not 0.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is increased by the integer division of `k` by `n`. The values of `res` and `k` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
