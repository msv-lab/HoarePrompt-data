The code snippet `ans += k // (i + 1)` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the result of the integer division `k // (i + 1)` to it. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans_list`, `dif`, and `i` remain unchanged unless `ans` is affected.

Given that `i` is `n - 2` and `n` is `t`, the expression `i + 1` simplifies to `t - 1`. Therefore, the operation performed is `ans += k // (t - 1)`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is increased by `k // (t - 1)`.**
