The code snippet provided appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_list`. 

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` is expressed as `ans * n - (n - 1) + res`. The values of `res`, `n`, `a`, and the condition based on `k` are also part of the initial state. However, the code only modifies `ans_list` by appending the current value of `ans` to it.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans * n - (n - 1) + res`, `res` is adjusted based on the number of non-zero `dif` values, and if `k` is not 0, `res` is further adjusted by `k % n`. `ans_list` contains the final `ans` and the newly appended `ans`. `n` and `a` remain unchanged.**
