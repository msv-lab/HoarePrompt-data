The code snippet `ans += dif` adds the value of `dif` to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume it starts at 0 (a common default for such variables). The value of `dif` is given by `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, which is the difference between the last two elements of the sorted list `a`. 

Given that `a` is sorted, `a[n - 1]` is the largest element, and `a[n - 2]` is the second largest element. Therefore, `dif` is non-negative. 

Since `dif` is added to `ans`, the new value of `ans` will be `dif` (assuming `ans` was 0 initially).

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ans_list`, `i`) remain unchanged by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, `n` is `t`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, `ans_list` is an empty list, `dif` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`, `i` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is `a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]`.**
