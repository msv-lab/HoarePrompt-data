The only variable in the loop head is `a`, and it iterates over each element in `ans_list`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current state of `ans_list` and the value of `a` at the end of the previous iteration.

Given:
- `ans_list` must contain at least one element.
- The loop iterates over `ans_list` with the variable `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` would have taken the value of the last element in `ans_list` that was processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `ans_list` must still have elements left to process. However, since the loop processes each element in sequence, and we are at the start of the next iteration, `a` will take the value of the next element in `ans_list`.

Since we do not know the exact number of elements in `ans_list` or their values, we can only state that `ans_list` must still have at least one element left unprocessed. The value of `a` will be the next element in `ans_list`.

State: **`ans_list` must contain at least one element**.

Note: The specific value of `a` cannot be determined without more information about the contents of `ans_list`, but we know it will be the next element in the list.
