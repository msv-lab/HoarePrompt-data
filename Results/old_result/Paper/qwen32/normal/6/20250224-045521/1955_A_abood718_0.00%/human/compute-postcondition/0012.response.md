Postcondition: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, where the input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces. If `B * 2 < C`, no specific changes are made to `A`, `B`, or `C`. Otherwise, if `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`, `A` remains unchanged if it is even. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
