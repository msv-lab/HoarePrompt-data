To determine the output of the `print` statement, we need to understand the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State:
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input.
- The input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces.
- `B` multiplied by 2 is less than `C`.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(A * B)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variables**: We know that `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers. However, their specific values are not provided directly in the initial state. The only condition we have is that `B * 2 < C`.

2. **Expression**: The `print` statement computes the product of `A` and `B`, i.e., `A * B`.

3. **Output**: Since the specific values of `A` and `B` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `A * B`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `A` and `B`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(A * B)` statement will output the product of the integers `A` and `B`, where `A` and `B` are the first and second integers from the input, respectively.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are the first and second integers from the input)**
