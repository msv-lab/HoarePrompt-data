Output State: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, where the input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces. The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0.**

Natural language: The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned the integer values from the input, which consists of three positive integers separated by spaces. The precondition that the input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0 still holds for each of the values assigned to `A`, `B`, and `C`.
