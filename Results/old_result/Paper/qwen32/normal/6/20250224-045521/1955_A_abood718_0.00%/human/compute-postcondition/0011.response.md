Postcondition: **`A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input, where the input consists of three positive integers separated by spaces. The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer greater than 0. Additionally, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`. If `A` is even, the program does not modify `A`. If `A` is odd, `X` is set to `A // 2`.**
