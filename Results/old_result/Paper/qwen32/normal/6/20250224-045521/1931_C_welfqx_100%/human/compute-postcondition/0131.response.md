The code snippet provided reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each split element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `num`. This operation changes the value of `num` but does not affect the other variables unless they are dependent on `num`.

Given the initial state:
- `f` is 1
- `onum` is the reversed copy of the new `num`
- `cn` is `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is the new `n`
- `symb1` is the first character of the new `num`
- `symb2` is the first character of `onum`
- `ii` is the new `n - 1`
- `ck` is the new `n`
- `r` is 1

After executing the code snippet, `num` will be a list of integers based on the input. The other variables (`f`, `onum`, `cn`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ii`, `ck`, `r`) will not be updated by this line of code, but their definitions will now depend on the newly assigned `num`.

Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of the new `num`, `cn` is `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is the new `n`, `symb1` is the first character of the new `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `ii` is the new `n - 1`, `ck` is the new `n`, `r` is 1, `num` is a list of integers from the input.**
