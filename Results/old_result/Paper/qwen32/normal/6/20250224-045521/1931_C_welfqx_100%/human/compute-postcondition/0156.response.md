The code snippet `symb2 = onum[0]` updates the value of `symb2` to be the first character of the string `onum`. The initial state specified that `symb2` was already the first character of `num`, but this line of code reassigns it to the first character of `onum`.

Given that `onum` is described as the reverse of `num`, the first character of `onum` would be the last character of `num`. Therefore, after executing the code, `symb2` will be the last character of `num`.

Here is the updated output state:

Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is 1; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` is the length of the input list.**
