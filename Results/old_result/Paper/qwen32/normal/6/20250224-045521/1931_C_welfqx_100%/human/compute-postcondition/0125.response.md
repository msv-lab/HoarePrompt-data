The code snippet `cn += ck` adds the value of `ck` to `cn`. Given the initial state, `cn` is equal to `n` and `ck` is also equal to `n`. Therefore, after the execution, `cn` will be `n + n`, which is `2 * n`.

The other variables (`f`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ii`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **f is 1, onum is the reversed copy of num, cn is 2 * n, symb1 is num[0], symb2 is onum[0], ii is n-1, ck is n, and symb1 is equal to symb2.**
