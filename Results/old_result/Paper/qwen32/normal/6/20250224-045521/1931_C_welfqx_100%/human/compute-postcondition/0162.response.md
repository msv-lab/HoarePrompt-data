Postcondition: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is 2 if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, otherwise `cn` is 1; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` must be at least 2. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is set to 2. Otherwise, `cn` remains 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
