The code snippet provided increments the variable `ck` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `ck`, we can only update `ck` to be one more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n`, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `ii` is 2, `ck` is `ck + 1`.**
