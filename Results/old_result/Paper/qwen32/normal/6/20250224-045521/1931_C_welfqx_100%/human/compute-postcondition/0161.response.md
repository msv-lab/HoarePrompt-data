Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `cn` is 1; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` must be at least 2; the character at index `i` of `num` is not equal to the character at index `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
