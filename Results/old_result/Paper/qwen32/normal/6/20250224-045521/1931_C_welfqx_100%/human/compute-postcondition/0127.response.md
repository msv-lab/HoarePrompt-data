To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the relationships between the variables:

1. **f**: This is given as 1, but it is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this calculation.
2. **onum**: This is the reversed copy of `num`. However, `num` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `onum`. We'll denote `num` as a list of digits for the sake of explanation.
3. **symb1**: This is the first element of `num`.
4. **symb2**: This is the first element of `onum`, which is the first element of the reversed `num`. Therefore, `symb2` is the last element of `num`.
5. **cn**: This is defined as `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise it remains `n`.
6. **ck**: This is defined as `n`.
7. **ii**: This is defined as `n - 1`, but it is not used in the print statement.
8. **n**: This is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we'll denote it as `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(n - max(cn, ck))
```

Let's analyze the expression `n - max(cn, ck)` step by step:

- **ck** is always `n`.
- **cn** is `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise it is `n`.

Therefore, the expression `max(cn, ck)` will be:
- `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2` (since `2 * n` is greater than `n`).
- `n` if `symb1` is not equal to `symb2` (since `n` is equal to `ck`).

So, the print statement will evaluate to:
- `n - 2 * n = -n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.
- `n - n = 0` if `symb1` is not equal to `symb2`.

Given the information, we cannot determine the exact value of `n` or whether `symb1` is equal to `symb2`. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where cn is 2 * n if symb1 is equal to symb2, otherwise cn is n, and ck is n)**
