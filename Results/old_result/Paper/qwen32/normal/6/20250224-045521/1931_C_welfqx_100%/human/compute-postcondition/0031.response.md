Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, `num` is a list of integers derived from the input, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the value where the loop broke, `f` is 1, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `i` is 0, and `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`.**
