Output State: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`; If `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; `cn` is 1; `ck` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ck` is assigned the value 1. The values of `f`, `onum`, the condition involving `n` and `f`, and `cn` remain unchanged.
