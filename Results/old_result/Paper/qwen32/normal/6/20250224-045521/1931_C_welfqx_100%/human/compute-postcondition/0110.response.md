The code snippet `ck += 1` increments the value of `ck` by 1. Therefore, `ck` which was initially 1, will now be 2. The other variables (`f`, `onum`, `cn`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `n`, and the condition `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is `n`, `ck` is 2, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`.**
