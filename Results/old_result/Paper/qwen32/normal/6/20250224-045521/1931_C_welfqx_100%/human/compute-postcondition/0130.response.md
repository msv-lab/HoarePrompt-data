The code snippet `f = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `f`. The other variables (`onum`, `cn`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ii`, `ck`, `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`f` is 1, `onum` is the reversed copy of the new `num`, `cn` is `2 * n` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is the new `n`, `symb1` is the first character of the new `num`, `symb2` is the first character of `onum`, `ii` is the new `n - 1`, `ck` is the new `n`, `r` is 1**.
