Postcondition: **`f` is 1; `onum` is the reverse of `num`; `symb1` is the first character of `num`; `symb2` is the last character of `num`; `ii` is `n - 1`; `ck` is 1; `r` is 1; `n` is at least 2; `i` is `n - 1`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, then `cn` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
