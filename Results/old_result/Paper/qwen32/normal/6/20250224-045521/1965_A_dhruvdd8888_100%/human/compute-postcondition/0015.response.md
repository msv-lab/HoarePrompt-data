To solve the problem, we need to understand the initial state and how the given Python code snippet affects it. The code snippet provided is:

```python
nw = True
```

This line of code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `nw`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

### Output State:
The output state will reflect the change in the `nw` variable while all other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain the same; `N` remains the same; `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list; `i` will be `len(nums) - 1` (the last index of `nums`); `nw` is `True`.**

In natural language: `nw` is now `True`, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
