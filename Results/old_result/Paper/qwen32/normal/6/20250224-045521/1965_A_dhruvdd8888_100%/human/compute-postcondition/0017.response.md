To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the loop head, which is `for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):`. The loop will iterate from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1` (inclusive). 

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **`i`**: The loop variable `i` is initialized to `len(nums) - 2` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches `1`. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `len(nums) - 1` as per the given state, but for the loop to execute, it needs to be set to `len(nums) - 2`.

2. **`nums`**: The state specifies that `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements. This transformation does not affect the loop's ability to execute, but it does affect the state of `nums`.

3. **`len(nums)`**: The length of `nums` determines the range of the loop. The loop will execute if `len(nums) - 2` is greater than or equal to `1`, which means `len(nums)` must be at least `3`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be `len(nums) - 2` (not `len(nums) - 1`).
- `nums` should be transformed according to the specified rule.
- `len(nums)` should be at least `3`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `nw`, `cw`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain the same; `N` remains the same; `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list; `i` is `len(nums) - 2`; `nw` is `True`; `cw` is `True`; `len(nums)` must be at least 3**
