The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the list `nums`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. Since the loop iterates over the range of the length of `nums`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The length of `nums` does not need to be adjusted because the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers obtained from the input string and includes the integer `0`, with `nums[i]` reduced by `nums[0]`; `ls` is `nums[0] + nums[1]`; `i` is 2**
