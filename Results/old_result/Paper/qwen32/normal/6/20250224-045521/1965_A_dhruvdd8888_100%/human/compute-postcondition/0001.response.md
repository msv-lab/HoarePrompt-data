The code snippet takes an input string, splits it into a list of substrings, and then converts this list into a set called `nums`. This means that `nums` will contain unique elements from the input string.

Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not affected by the code snippet. The only change is the creation of the `nums` set from the input string.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a set of unique substrings obtained from the input string.**
