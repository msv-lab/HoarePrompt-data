To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is `i`. The loop is defined as:

```python
for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

This indicates that `i` starts from `len(nums) - 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1 (inclusive).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls` remain unchanged.
- `i` is `i - 1`.
- `nums` remains the same, but each `nums[i]` is transformed such that it is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements.
- `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` was 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`.
- `nw` is equal to `cw`.

To execute the next iteration, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 to get the correct starting value for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Adjust `i`:** Since `i` is `i - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to set `i` to `i + 1` to start the next iteration.

### Final State:
- `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `nums`, `cw`, `nw` remain the same as described in the initial state.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

State: **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i + 1`, `nums` remains the same, `len(nums)` is at least 3, `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements, `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` was 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`, `nw` is equal to `cw`**
