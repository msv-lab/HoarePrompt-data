The code snippet `nw = cw` simply assigns the current value of `cw` to `nw`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `nw` will now be the same as the value of `cw`.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` remains the same, `len(nums)` is at least 3, `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements, `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` was 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`, `nw` is equal to `cw`.**
