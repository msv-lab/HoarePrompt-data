Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain the same; `N` remains the same; `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements; `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list; `i` will be `len(nums) - 1` (the last index of `nums`); `nw` is `True`; `cw` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(nums) - 2, 0, -1):
    if nums[i] == 1:
        cw = not nw
    else:
        cw = True
    nw = cw


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i`, and `nums` remain the same. `len(nums)` is at least 3. `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements. If `nums[i]` was 1, `cw` is `False`; otherwise, `cw` is `True`. `nw` is `cw`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` remains the same, `len(nums)` is at least 3, `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements, `cw` is `False` if `nums[i]` was 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`, `nw` is equal to `cw`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i + 1`, `nums` remains the same, `len(nums)` is at least 3, `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements. If `nums[i]` was 1, `cw` is the opposite of `nw` and `nw` is equal to the original `cw`. Otherwise, `cw` is `True` and `nw` is equal to `cw`. `nw` is equal to `cw`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
