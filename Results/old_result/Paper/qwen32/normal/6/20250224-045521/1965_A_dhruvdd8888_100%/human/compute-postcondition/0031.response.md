Output State: **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i + 1`, `nums` remains the same, `len(nums)` is at least 3, `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements, `cw` is `True`, `nw` is equal to `cw`**

Explanation: The variable `cw` is explicitly set to `True` in the code snippet. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
