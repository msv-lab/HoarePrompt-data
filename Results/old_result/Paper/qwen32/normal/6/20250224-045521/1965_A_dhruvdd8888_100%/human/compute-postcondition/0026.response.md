The code snippet provided is simply `cw = True`. This line of code explicitly sets the variable `cw` to `True`, regardless of its previous value.

Given the initial state, the only change that occurs is the value of `cw`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `N`, `ls`, `i` is `i - 1`, and `nums` remain the same. `len(nums)` is at least 3. `nums` is transformed such that each `nums[i]` is the original `nums[i]` minus the cumulative sum of all previous elements. If `nums[i]` was 1, `cw` is `False`; otherwise, `cw` is `True`. `nw` is `cw`. `cw` is `True`.**
