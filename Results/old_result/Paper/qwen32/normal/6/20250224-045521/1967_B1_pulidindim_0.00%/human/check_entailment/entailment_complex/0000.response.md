### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve this problem. Let's break down the intended logic and compare it with the code:

1. **Intended Logic**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), check if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Count such pairs and print the count for each test case.

2. **Given Code**:
   - The code initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
   - It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `g` as `n / count` and checks if `g` is less than `count - 1`. If so, it breaks out of the loop.
   - It then adjusts `g` by subtracting `count - 1` and calculates `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to it.
   - Finally, it prints the integer value of `ans`.

This logic does not correctly iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be attempting a different, incorrect method to count the pairs.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
