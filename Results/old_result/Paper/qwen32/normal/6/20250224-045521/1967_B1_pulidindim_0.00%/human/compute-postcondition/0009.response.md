Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `countmins` is 1; `g` is `n / 2`; `g` is less than `countmins` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
