The value of `countmins` is assigned the value of `count - 1`. Given that `count` is 2, `countmins` becomes 1. The values of other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `count`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `m` must be at least 2; `count` is 2; `ans` is `n`; `countmins` is 1**
