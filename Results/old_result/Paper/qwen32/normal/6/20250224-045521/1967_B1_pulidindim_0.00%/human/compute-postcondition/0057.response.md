Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + n / 9 + 1.5 - 2/3`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, otherwise the values of the variables remain unchanged.**
