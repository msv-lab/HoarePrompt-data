Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + 0.5`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural Language: The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
