Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is at least 3; `count` is 3; `ans` is `n + n / 4 + 0.5`; `countmins` is 2; `g` is `n / 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
