Let's analyze the given Python program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The program iterates through each test case and calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given constraints. However, the logic implemented in the program does not seem to correctly address the problem requirements. Let's break down the logic:

1. The program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`. This initialization seems arbitrary and does not align with the problem requirements.
2. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
3. Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as `n / count`.
4. It checks if `g` is less than `countmins`. If true, it breaks out of the loop.
5. It then adjusts `g` by subtracting `countmins` and adds `g / count + 1` to `ans`.
6. The loop increments `count` by 1 and the process repeats until the loop condition is no longer satisfied.
7. Finally, it prints the integer value of `ans`.

### Issues with the Program
The program does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The logic for calculating `ans` and the conditions under which it breaks out of the loop do not match the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness
Given the analysis above, the program is incorrect as it does not properly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
