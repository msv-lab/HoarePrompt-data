Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `m` is greater than 4; `count` is 4; `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - countmins) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - countmins) / 3 + 1`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `n / 4`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as well.**
