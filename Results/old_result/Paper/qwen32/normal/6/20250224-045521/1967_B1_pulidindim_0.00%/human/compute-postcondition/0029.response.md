Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `m` is greater than 4; `count` is 5; `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - countmins) / 2 + 1 + (n / 3 - countmins) / 3 + 1 + (n / 4 - 3) / 4 + 1`; `countmins` is 3; `g` is `n / 4 - 3`.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. All other variables retain their initial values.
