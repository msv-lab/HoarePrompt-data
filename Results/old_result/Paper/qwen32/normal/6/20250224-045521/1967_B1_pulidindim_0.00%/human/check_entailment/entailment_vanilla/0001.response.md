Let's analyze the provided Python program and compare it with the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \le a \le n\)
- \(1 \le b \le m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Program Analysis
The program provided attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues.

1. **Initialization of `count` and `ans`**:
   - The program initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
   - The initialization of `ans` to `n` is incorrect because it assumes that every pair \((a, 1)\) is valid, which is not necessarily true. For example, if \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 2\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is valid, but if \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), \(a + b = 3\) and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 1\), which is also valid. However, the program's logic for counting pairs is flawed.

2. **Loop and Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over possible values of `count` from 2 to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as `n / count`.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` seems to be checking if `n / count` is less than `count - 1`, but this condition is not logically derived from the problem statement.
   - The subsequent calculation `g -= countmins` and `ans += g / count + 1` is also not derived from the problem statement and doesn't correctly count the number of valid pairs.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the integer value of `ans`, which is not correctly computed.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This can be done using nested loops, but since \(n\) and \(m\) can be up to \(2 \times 10^6\), a brute-force approach is not feasible. Instead, we need a more efficient approach, possibly involving mathematical insights or optimizations.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It contains logical errors in the initialization and the loop conditions, and the final output is not correctly computed.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
