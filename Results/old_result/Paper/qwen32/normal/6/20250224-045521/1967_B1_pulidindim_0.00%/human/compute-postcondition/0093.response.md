To determine what will be printed, let's carefully analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable represents the number of test cases or iterations, but it is not directly used in the provided code snippet.
2. **n**: The first integer from the input. This variable's value is not specified in the initial state, but it is read from the input.
3. **m**: The second integer from the input. Similar to `n`, this variable's value is not specified in the initial state, but it is read from the input.
4. **count**: This variable is set to `m + 1`. Therefore, `count` is directly dependent on the value of `m`.
5. **ans**: This variable holds the accumulated value after all iterations. However, since the code snippet does not show any accumulation process, its value is not explicitly determined from the initial state.
6. **i**: This variable is set to `i + 1`. However, `i` is not initialized in the initial state, so this operation does not have a defined effect without prior initialization.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(int(ans))
```
This line will print the integer value of `ans`.

### Determining the Output:
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Given the context, it seems like `ans` should be some accumulated result from previous operations (not shown in the provided snippet). Without additional context or code, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`.
- **`int(ans)`**: The `print` statement will convert `ans` to an integer and print it. Since the exact value of `ans` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of `ans`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **ans (where ans is the accumulated value after all iterations)**
