The code calculates the squared distance between two points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, `c`, `d`, `g`, and `h` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` and `b` are the two integers provided as input; `c` and `d` are the two integers from the input split by space; `e` and `f` are the two integers from the new input split by space; `g` and `h` are the two integers from the latest input split by space; `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`**.
