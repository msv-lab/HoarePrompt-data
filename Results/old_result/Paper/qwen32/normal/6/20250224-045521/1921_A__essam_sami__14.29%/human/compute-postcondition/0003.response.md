The code snippet assigns the values of `c` and `d` from the input, which is split into two integers. The initial state of `t`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` and `b` are the two integers provided as input; `c` and `d` are the two integers from the input split by space.**
