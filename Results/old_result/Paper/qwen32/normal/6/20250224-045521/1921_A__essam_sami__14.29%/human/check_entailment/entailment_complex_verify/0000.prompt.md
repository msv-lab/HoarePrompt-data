You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each of the t test cases, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has printed the smaller value between `n` and `x`, where `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)` and `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. The variables `a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h` hold the values from the last iteration, and `steps` is equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the corners of a square and prints the area of the smaller square between two calculated values `n` and `x`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the area of a square given its four corner coordinates.
- The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes.
- The coordinates are provided in random order.
- The area of the square should be strictly greater than 0.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of the square. It calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and prints the smaller of the two squared distances as the area of the square.

### Issues in the Program:
The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then prints the smaller of the two distances. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly determine the side length of the square. The program should calculate the distances between all pairs of points and determine the correct side length of the square.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the area of the square, we need to calculate the distances between all pairs of points and identify the side length of the square. Since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the unique differences in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the points.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
The correct area of the square is \(4\). However, the program might calculate the distance between \((0, 0)\) and \((2, 0)\) as \(4\) and the distance between \((0, 0)\) and \((0, 2)\) as \(4\), and then incorrectly print \(4\) as the area, which is actually correct in this case but not due to the logic used. However, if we consider a case where the points are not in a straightforward order, the program might fail.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all cases correctly because it does not properly identify the side length of the square. It only compares two distances and prints the smaller one, which is not a reliable method to determine the area of the square.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program does not correctly determine the side length of the square in all cases. It only compares two distances and prints the smaller one, which is not a reliable method to determine the area of the square. A correct approach would involve calculating the distances between all pairs of points and identifying the correct side length of the square.
