Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each of the t test cases, there are four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) where -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has printed the smaller value between `n` and `x`, where `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)` and `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. The variables `a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h` hold the values from the last iteration, and `steps` is equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the corners of a square and prints the area of the smaller square between two calculated values `n` and `x`.
