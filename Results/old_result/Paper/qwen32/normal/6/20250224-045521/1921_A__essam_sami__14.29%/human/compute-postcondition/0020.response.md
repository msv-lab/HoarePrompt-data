To determine what will be printed by the `print(n)` statement, we need to understand the value of `n` based on the given initial state.

The initial state describes the following:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.
- `a`, `b` are integers read from input.
- `c`, `d` are integers read from input.
- `e`, `f` are integers read from input.
- `g`, `h` are integers read from input.
- `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.
- `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`.
- There is a comparison between `x` and `n`, but this comparison does not affect the value of `n`.
- `steps` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `steps` from the previous iteration, but `steps` is not used in the `print(n)` statement.

The `print(n)` statement will output the value of `n`, which is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is calculated as (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f))**
