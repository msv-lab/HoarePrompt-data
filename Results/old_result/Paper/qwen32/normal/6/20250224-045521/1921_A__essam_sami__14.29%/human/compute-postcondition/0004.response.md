The code snippet assigns the values from the input to the variables `e` and `f`. The initial state specifies that `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` have specific values, but the values of `e` and `f` are not defined. After the code execution, `e` and `f` will hold the values provided by the input, split by space and converted to integers.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` and `b` are the two integers provided as input; `c` and `d` are the two integers from the input split by space; `e` and `f` are the two integers from the new input split by space.**
