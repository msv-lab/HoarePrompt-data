The provided Python code snippet updates the values of `a` and `b` by reading a new pair of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, `x`, `steps`) remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by subsequent operations, which are not shown in the given snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a`, `b` are new integers read from input; `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h` are integers provided as input; `n` is calculated as `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is calculated as `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. If `x` is greater than `n`, the current value of `x` is greater than `n`. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to `n`; `steps` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `steps` at the end of the previous iteration.**
