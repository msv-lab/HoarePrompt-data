testcases is a list of lists, where each inner list contains four tuples, and each tuple contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. It is guaranteed that for each test case, there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0) area, with corners in the given points.
