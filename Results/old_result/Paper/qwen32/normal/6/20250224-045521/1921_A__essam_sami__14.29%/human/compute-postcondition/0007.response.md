The code calculates the value of `x` using the formula `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100; `a` and `b` are the two integers provided as input; `c` and `d` are the two integers from the input split by space; `e` and `f` are the two integers from the new input split by space; `g` and `h` are the two integers from the latest input split by space; `n` is `(a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)`; `x` is `(c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)`**.
