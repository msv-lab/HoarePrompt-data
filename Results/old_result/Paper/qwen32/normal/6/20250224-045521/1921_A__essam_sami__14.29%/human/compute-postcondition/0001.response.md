The only variables in the loop head are `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. Since `t` is already within the required range, no adjustment to `t` is necessary to ensure the loop executes. The variable `steps` is the loop variable and will be initialized automatically by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is the input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100**
