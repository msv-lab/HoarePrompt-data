The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given this, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

The states `cnt` and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so we do not adjust them.

State: **`n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.

To be more specific, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` would be 4.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4**.
