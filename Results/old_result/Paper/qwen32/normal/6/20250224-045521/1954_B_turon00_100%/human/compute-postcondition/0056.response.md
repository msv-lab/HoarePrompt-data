The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the variable `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. This means that if `cnt` is smaller than `ans`, `ans` will be updated to the value of `cnt`. Otherwise, `ans` will retain its previous value.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` remains the same, `_` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `tmp` remains the same, `cnt` is the count of consecutive `tmp` at the end of the list or 0, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive `tmp` found during the loop or the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
