In the given task, the for loop will iterate `n` times, and the loop variable is `i`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0, because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

Let's analyze the given state and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

- `n` is an input integer: This is the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is one less than `t`: This variable is not used in the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop.
- `a` is a list of integers read from input: This variable is also not used in the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop.
- `tmp` is the first element of `a`: This variable is not used in the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop.
- `cnt` is 0: This variable is not used in the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop.
- `ans` is `n`: This variable is not used in the loop head and does not affect the execution of the loop.

Since only the state of `n` in the loop head can be adjusted to ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
