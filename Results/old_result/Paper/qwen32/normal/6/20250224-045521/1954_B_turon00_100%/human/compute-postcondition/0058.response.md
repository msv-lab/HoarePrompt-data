The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print(-1)`. This statement will output the integer `-1` regardless of the values of the variables `n`, `_`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, or `ans` as described in the initial state.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `_`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, `ans`) and their relationships.
2. The `print(-1)` statement does not depend on any of these variables.
3. The statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Therefore, the output is straightforward and does not involve any calculations or conditions based on the provided variables.

Output: **-1**
