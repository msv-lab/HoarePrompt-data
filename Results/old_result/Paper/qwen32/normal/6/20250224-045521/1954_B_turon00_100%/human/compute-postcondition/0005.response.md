The code snippet initializes a variable `cnt` to 0. The other variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `t`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp`, with `cnt` being set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `cnt` is 0.**
