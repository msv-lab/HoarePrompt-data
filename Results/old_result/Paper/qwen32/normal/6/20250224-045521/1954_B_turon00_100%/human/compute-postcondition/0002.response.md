Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful according to the problem's definition. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Natural language: The value of `n` is updated to be the input integer. The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
