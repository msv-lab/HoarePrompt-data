The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet, except that `i` was previously incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `n` must still be greater than this new value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`.**
