Let's analyze the loop and determine the final state after all iterations.

The loop iterates over each element of the list `a` and checks if the current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` (which is initially set to `a[0]`). If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, it increments `cnt`. If `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and then resets `cnt` to 0.

Here's what happens after all iterations:
- `tmp` remains `a[0]` throughout the loop.
- `cnt` will be the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`.
- `ans` will be the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only `tmp` (or `n` if all elements are `tmp`).

The final state of the variables after the loop:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `tmp` remains `a[0]`.
- `cnt` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`.
- `ans` is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only `tmp` (or `n` if all elements are `tmp`).

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers read from the input; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `cnt` is the length of the longest contiguous subarray starting from `a[0]` that contains only `tmp`; `ans` is the length of the shortest contiguous subarray that contains only `tmp` (or `n` if all elements are `tmp`).**

In simpler terms, `cnt` will be the count of consecutive elements starting from the first element that are the same, and `ans` will be the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same starting from the first element, or `n` if all elements are the same.
