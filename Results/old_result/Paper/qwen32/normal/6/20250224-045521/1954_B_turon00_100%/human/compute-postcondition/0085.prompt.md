Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer; `_` is one less than `t`; `a` is a list of integers read from input; `tmp` is the first element of `a`; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be greater than 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of its current value and 0, and `cnt` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value. If `a[i]` was equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and 0, and `cnt` is reset to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4. If `a[i]` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and 0, and `cnt` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
