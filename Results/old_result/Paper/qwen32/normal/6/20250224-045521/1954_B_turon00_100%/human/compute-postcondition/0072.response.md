The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The other variables `n` and `a[i]` are not affected by this code.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0 and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, these conditions remain unchanged. The only variable that changes is `ans`, which is set to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.**
