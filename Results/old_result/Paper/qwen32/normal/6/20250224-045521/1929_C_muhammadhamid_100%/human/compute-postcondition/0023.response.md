The provided code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The variable `s` is mentioned in the initial state but is not modified by the given code snippet. The variable `i` is also mentioned as being set to `x`, but `i` is not modified by the given code snippet either. Therefore, the only change is that `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`s` is updated `x` times according to `s = s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `i` is `x`; `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values from the input.**
