The only variable in the loop head of the given `for` loop is `i`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `1` because the range function in Python, `range(1, n)`, generates numbers from `1` up to, but not including, `n`. If `n` is `1` or less, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

- `n` must be greater than `1` to ensure the loop executes.
- `i` is the loop variable and will be set to `1` before the first iteration of the loop.

The other variables (`k`, `sz`, `T`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`) are not in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
