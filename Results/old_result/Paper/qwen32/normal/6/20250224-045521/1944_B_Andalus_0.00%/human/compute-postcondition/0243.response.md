The code snippet `lft = lst[:n]` slices the list `lst` from the beginning up to the `n`-th element and assigns this slice to the variable `lft`. The values of `n`, `k`, `sz`, `T`, and the elements of `lst` are not altered by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.**
