The code snippet provided reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. This integer represents the number of test cases, `t`, which was initially specified as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged and are still part of the precondition for each test case.

Output State: **`T` is an integer read from input, representing the number of test cases; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= floor(n/2), and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.**
