Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one pair of adjacent duplicates, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them and has more than one element, and `sz` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `k`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language: The values of all the variables remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
