The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lft` to the list `sng`. Given that `i` is 2, this means the third element of `lft` (since list indices start at 0) is appended to `sng`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `sng` now includes the element `lft[2]` appended to it.**
