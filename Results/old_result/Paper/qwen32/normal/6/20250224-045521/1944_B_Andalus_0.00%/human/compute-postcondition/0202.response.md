The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which iterates over `rdb`. For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `rdb` is not empty.

Let's break it down:

- `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
- For `rdb` to be non-empty, `rgt` must contain at least one pair of adjacent elements that are the same.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to make sure that `rgt` has at least one pair of adjacent duplicates. The other variables (`T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `sng`, `i`, `sz`) do not directly affect whether the loop will execute, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one pair of adjacent duplicates, `i` is `n-1`, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them, and `sz` is 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute because `rdb` will contain at least one element.
