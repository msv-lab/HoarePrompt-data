The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which is the loop variable for the `for` loop iterating over `rdb`. Thus, we need to adjust the state of `elem` for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements.
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element.
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.

Since the loop iterates over `rdb`, `elem` will take on the value of the next element in `rdb` in the next iteration. Therefore, we need to move to the next element in `rdb`.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element, `i` is `n - 1`, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`**.

Since the exact elements of `rdb` are not specified, we can't specify the exact value of `elem`. However, we know it will be the next element in `rdb` for the next iteration.
