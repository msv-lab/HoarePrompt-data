Reasoning: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by dividing the array into two halves and then selecting elements from each half to form the arrays `l` and `r` such that their bitwise XORs are equal. However, the logic used in the program is flawed, and it does not guarantee that the resulting arrays `l` and `r` will have the same bitwise XOR.

Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Selection of Elements**: The program selects elements from the sorted halves of the array without considering the requirement that the XOR of the elements in `l` must be equal to the XOR of the elements in `r`. It simply selects pairs of identical elements from each half, which may not result in equal XORs.

2. **Handling of Single Elements**: The program handles single elements (those that do not have a duplicate) by adding them to the arrays `l` and `r`, but this does not ensure that the XORs of the resulting arrays will be equal.

3. **No Guarantee of Correctness**: The program does not ensure that the final arrays `l` and `r` will have the same bitwise XOR. It only ensures that the arrays have the required number of elements, but it does not guarantee that the XOR condition is met.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
