To determine what will be printed, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and the print statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **T**: An integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
2. **t**: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
3. **n**: The first integer from the input, and it must be greater than 1.
4. **k**: The second integer from the input.
5. **lst**: A list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
6. **lft**: A sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
7. **rgt**: A sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
8. **ldb**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least two elements.
9. **sng**: Contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element.
10. **rdb**: Contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element.
11. **i**: Set to `n` - 1.
12. **elem**: The second element of `ldb`.
13. **sz**: Not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it seems to be a variable that is used in a loop or condition to break out of the loop if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Key Points for the Print Statement:
- The print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.
- We need to determine the value of `elem`.

### Determining the Value of `elem`:
- `elem` is defined as the second element of `ldb`.
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least two elements.

Since `ldb` must contain at least two elements and `elem` is the second element of `ldb`, `elem` will be the second occurrence of a duplicate element in the sorted list `lft`.

### Output:
The print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.

### Final Output:
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the second element of ldb, which is the second occurrence of a duplicate element in the sorted list lft)**
