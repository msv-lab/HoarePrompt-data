The only object in the loop head is `elem`, which is an element from the list `rdb`. To ensure the loop can execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element. According to the given state, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element. Therefore, to make the loop execute, `rdb` must have at least one element that is a duplicate of the previous element in `rgt`.

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element, `i` is `n - 1`, `sz` is 0**
