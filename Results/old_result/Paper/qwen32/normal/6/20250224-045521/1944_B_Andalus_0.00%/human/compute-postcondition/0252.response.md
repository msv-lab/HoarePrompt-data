The code snippet appends the `i`-th element of the list `lft` to the list `ldb`. Given that `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the `i`-th element being appended is the same as the previous element in `lft`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is a list containing the `i`-th element of `lft` (which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`), `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, and `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`.**
