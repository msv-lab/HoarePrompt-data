The code snippet `rgt = lst[n:]` slices the list `lst` starting from the index `n` to the end of the list. This means that `rgt` will contain all the elements of `lst` that come after the first `n` elements.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`.
- `T` is at least 1.
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input.
- `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.

The variable `rgt` is introduced and assigned the value of `lst[n:]`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `sz`, `T`, `lst`, or `lft`. The only change is the introduction of `rgt`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.**
