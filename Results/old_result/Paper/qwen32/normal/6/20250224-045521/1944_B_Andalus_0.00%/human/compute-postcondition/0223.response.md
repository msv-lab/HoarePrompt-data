The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the iterable `sng`. To ensure the loop can execute, `sng` must be an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) that contains at least one element. The state of `elem` will be determined by the first element of `sng` during the first iteration of the loop, so we do not need to specify it before the loop starts.

Given that `sz` is `min(k, 2*m)` and all other variables remain unchanged, we need to focus on `sng` to ensure the loop can execute. 

State: **`sz` is `min(k, 2*m)`, `sng` must be an iterable with at least one element**.
