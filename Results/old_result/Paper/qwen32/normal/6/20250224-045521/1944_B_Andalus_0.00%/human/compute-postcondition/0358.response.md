Let's break down the given information and determine the output of the `print` statement.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`rdb`**: This is a list or some iterable that has been processed up to a certain point.
2. **`sz`**: This variable is defined as the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 2.
   - If `k` is even, `sz` would be `k + 2`.
   - If `k` is odd, `sz` would be `k + 1`.
3. **`k`**: This is some integer value that indicates a certain point in the processing of `rdb`.
4. **`sng`**: This is a list or some iterable from which the first `k` elements have been printed.
5. **`elem`**: This variable holds the next element in `sng` after the `k`-th element.
6. **Loop/Conditional Exit**: If `sz >= k`, the loop or the most internal block of code is exited. If `sz < k`, the execution continues.

### Analysis:
- The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` followed by a space, without a newline.
- `elem` is explicitly stated to be the next element in `sng` after the `k`-th element.

### Output:
Given the above analysis, the output will be the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **elem (where elem is the next element in `sng` after the `k`-th element)**
