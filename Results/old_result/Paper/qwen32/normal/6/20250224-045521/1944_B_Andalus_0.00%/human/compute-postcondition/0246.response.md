The code snippet `rdb = []` initializes a new empty list named `rdb`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list.**
