The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ldb`. If `ldb` contains more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element in `ldb`.

At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the next element in `ldb`. For the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must have at least one more element after `elem`. Therefore, `elem` should be updated to the next element in `ldb`.

State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `ldb` contains at least one more element after `elem`, `sz` is increased by 2 if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `sz` remains unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `ldb`**
