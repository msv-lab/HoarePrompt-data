The code snippet `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) of the list `rgt` to the list `rdb`.

Given the initial state:
- `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element.
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element.
- `i` is 3.
- If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, `rdb` is a list containing `rgt[2]`. Otherwise, `rdb` remains an empty list.

After executing `rdb.append(rgt[i])`:
- `rdb` will now include `rgt[3]` in addition to whatever elements it previously contained (if any).

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000; `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1; `k` is the second integer from the input; `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input; `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`; `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end; `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element; `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element; `i` is 3; `rdb` is a list that includes `rgt[3]` and any previous elements it contained.**
