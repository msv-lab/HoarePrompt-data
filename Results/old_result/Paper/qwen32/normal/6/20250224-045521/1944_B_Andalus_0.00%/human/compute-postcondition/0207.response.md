To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and the variables involved in the `print` statement.

The `print` statement in question is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

From the initial state, we don't have any explicit information about a variable named `elem`. However, based on the context and the variables mentioned in the initial state, we can infer that `elem` might be one of the elements from `lft` or `rgt` lists, or possibly another variable that is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state.

Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe the output in terms of `elem`.

The `print` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and without a newline at the end due to `end=' '`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the value of the variable elem)**
