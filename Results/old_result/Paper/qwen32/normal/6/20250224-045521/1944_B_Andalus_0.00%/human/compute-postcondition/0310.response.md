Postcondition: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is `k + 1` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 1 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least two elements, `elem` is the next element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
