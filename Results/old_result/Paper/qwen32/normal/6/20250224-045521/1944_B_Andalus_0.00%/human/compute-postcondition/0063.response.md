The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`, which iterates over the elements of the list `sng`. To ensure that the loop can execute, `sng` must contain at least one element. The other variables mentioned in the state description (`T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `i`, and `sz`) are not directly related to the execution of this specific for loop and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted such that `sng` contains at least one element.

State: **`T` is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements, `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element and must contain at least one element, `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element, `i` is `n - 1`, `sz` is 6**
