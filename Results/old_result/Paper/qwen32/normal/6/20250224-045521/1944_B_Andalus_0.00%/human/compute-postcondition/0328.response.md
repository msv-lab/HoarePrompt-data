Output State: **`rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is 2, the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed, and `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` has been incremented by 2, so it is now 2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
