The code snippet appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `rgt[i]` equals `rgt[i - 1]`, the value being appended is the same as the previous element in the `rgt` list.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `rgt[i]` equals `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` has a new element appended which is equal to `rgt[i]`.**

In natural language: The value of `rgt[i]` (which is the same as `rgt[i - 1]`) has been added to the end of the list `rdb`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
