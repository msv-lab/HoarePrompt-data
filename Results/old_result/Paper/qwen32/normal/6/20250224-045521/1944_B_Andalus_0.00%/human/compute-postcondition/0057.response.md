Output State: **`elem` is the third element of `ldb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `elem` remains unchanged as it is still the third element of `ldb`. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but it does not affect the value of `elem`.
