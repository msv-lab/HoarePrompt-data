To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the given initial and intermediate states and the loop's behavior.

### Key Observations:
1. The loop iterates over the `sng` list, printing each element and incrementing `sz` until `sz` reaches `k` or the list `sng` is exhausted.
2. From the given states, we know:
   - `sng` initially contains elements that are neither equal to the previous nor the next element in `lft`.
   - `sz` starts at `k` and increments by 1 for each printed element.
   - The loop breaks if `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`.

### Analysis of Given States:
- **After 1st iteration**: `sz` is `k + 1`, meaning 1 element from `sng` was printed.
- **After 2nd iteration**: `sz` is `k + 2`, meaning 2 elements from `sng` were printed.
- **After 3rd iteration**: `sz` is `k + 3`, meaning 3 elements from `sng` were printed.

Given these states, we can infer that the loop prints elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k`.

### Final State Calculation:
- If `sz` is `k + 3` after 3 iterations, and the loop breaks when `sz` reaches `k`, it implies `k` must be 3.
- Therefore, the loop would have printed all elements in `sng` up to the point where `sz` equals `k`.
- Since `sng` contains `[2, 3]` after 3 iterations, and the loop breaks at `k = 3`, it means `sng` must have contained at least 3 elements initially, but only the first two were printed.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will print elements from `sng` until `sz` reaches `k`.
- If `k = 3`, the loop will print the first 3 elements of `sng` if they exist, or fewer if `sng` has fewer than 3 elements.

Given the provided states, `sng` initially had at least 2 elements (`[2, 3]`), and since `k = 3`, the loop would have printed these elements and stopped because `sz` would have reached `k` after printing the second element.

### Final Output State:
- `sz` will be `k` (which is 3).
- The loop will have printed the first 2 elements of `sng`.

Output State: **T is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is 3, k is 3, lst is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], lft is [1, 2, 3], rgt is [4, 5], ldb is [], sng is [2, 3], rdb is [], i is 2, sz is 3.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the loop will have printed the first two elements of `sng` (which are 2 and 3), and `sz` will be equal to `k` (which is 3). The state of other variables remains unchanged as per the initial conditions.
