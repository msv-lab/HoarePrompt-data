To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus only on the variables that appear in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `i`. The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`, so only `i` can be adjusted.

Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 according to the loop's behavior.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000, `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1, `k` is `input_k`, `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `sz` is 3, `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them, and `rdb` contains the element `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`. If `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[1]`, then `rdb` includes `rgt[2]`.**
