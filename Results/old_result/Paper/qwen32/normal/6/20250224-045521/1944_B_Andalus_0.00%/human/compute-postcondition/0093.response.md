Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine the output.

### Initial State Breakdown
- `T` is an integer such that `T` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements.
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element.
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `elem` is the next element in `rdb`.
- If `sz` (not explicitly defined in the precondition but can be inferred as the size of some list) is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

### Analysis of the Print Statement
The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

#### Variables Involved
- `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element.

### Determining the Output
- Since `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least one element, `elem` is one of these duplicate elements.
- The print statement prints `elem` twice followed by a space.

### Conclusion
Given the initial state, `elem` is a specific element from `rdb` which is a list of duplicate elements from `rgt`. The print statement will output this element twice consecutively, separated by a space.

### Final Output
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in rdb)**
