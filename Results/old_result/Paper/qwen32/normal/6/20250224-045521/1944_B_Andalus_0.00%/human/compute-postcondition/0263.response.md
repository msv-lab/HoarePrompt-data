The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the loop statement, `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`
- `T` is at least 1
- `lst` is a list of integers from the input
- `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end
- `rdb` is an empty list. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]` (where `i` is 2), then `ldb` contains the `i`-th element of `lft` (which is equal to `lft[i - 1]`). Otherwise, `ldb` is an empty list.
- If `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the element `lft[2]`. Otherwise, `sng` remains an empty list.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1 (since the loop starts at 1). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `sz` is `min(k, len(sng) + min(k, 2*m))`, `T` is at least 1, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is a sorted list of the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
