The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem`. According to the loop statement, `elem` iterates over the elements in the list `sng`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still have elements that have not been processed yet.

At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` was the last processed element in `sng`. To start the next iteration, `elem` should be the next element in `sng` after the last processed element.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `T` is an integer such that T is greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer from the input.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
- `lft` is a sorted list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`.
- `rgt` is a sorted list containing the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end.
- `ldb` contains all elements from `lft` that are duplicates of the previous element and must contain at least three elements.
- `sng` contains all elements from `lft` that are neither equal to the previous element nor the next element and must contain at least two elements.
- `rdb` contains all elements from `rgt` that are duplicates of the previous element.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `sz` is 8. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the last processed element.

Since `elem` is already described as the next element in `sng` after the last processed element, no further adjustment is needed for `elem` itself. However, it is implied that `sng` must still have at least one more element for the loop to continue.
