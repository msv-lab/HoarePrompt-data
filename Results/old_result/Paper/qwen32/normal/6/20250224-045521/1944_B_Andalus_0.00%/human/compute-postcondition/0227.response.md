To determine what will be printed by the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to understand the context and the variables involved.

From the initial state, we know:
- `sz` is defined as `min(k, 2*m)`.
- `sng` is an iterable with at least one element.
- There is a condition that if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to `sz` or `sng`.

However, the code snippet provided does not contain any explicit loop or if statement, but rather a `print(elem, end=' ')` statement. The variable `elem` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state. This implies that `elem` must be defined in the context of a loop or some other part of the code not provided here.

Since `elem` is not defined in the initial state, we can only describe the print statement in terms of `elem`. The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function specifies that the output should end with a space instead of the default newline character.

Given the lack of specific details about how `elem` is determined, we can only say that the print statement will output the value of `elem` followed by a space.

Output: **elem (followed by a space)**
