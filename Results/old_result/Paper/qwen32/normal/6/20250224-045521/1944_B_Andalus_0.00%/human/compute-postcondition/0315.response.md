Postcondition: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, `sz` is `k + 2` (or the largest even number less than `k` plus 2 if `k` is odd and all elements in `ldb` have been processed), `sng` must have at least three elements, `elem` is the second element in `sng`. If `sz >= k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
