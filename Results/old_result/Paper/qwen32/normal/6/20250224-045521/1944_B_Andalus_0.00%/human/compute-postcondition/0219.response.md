To determine the output of the `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the given initial state and understand the values of the variables involved.

1. **Variables and Conditions**:
   - `T` is an integer such that `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 5000.
   - `n` is `input_n` and must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is `input_k`.
   - `lst` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order.
   - `rgt` is `lst[n:]` sorted in ascending order and must contain at least one pair of adjacent duplicates.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `ldb` contains all elements in `lft` that have at least one duplicate next to them.
   - `sng` contains all elements in `lft` that do not have any duplicates next to them.
   - `rdb` contains the elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them and has more than one element.
   - `sz` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `k`.
   - `elem` is the next element in `rdb` that hasn't been processed yet.
   - If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.

2. **Key Focus**:
   - The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, and will not add a newline at the end.
   - `elem` is defined as the next element in `rdb` that hasn't been processed yet. `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them and has more than one element.

3. **Output Analysis**:
   - Since `elem` is the next element in `rdb` that hasn't been processed yet, and `rdb` contains elements from `rgt` that have at least one duplicate next to them, `elem` must be one of those elements.
   - The `print` statement will output `elem` twice, separated by a space.

Given the information, the output will be `elem elem` (where `elem` is the next element in `rdb` that hasn't been processed yet).

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the next element in `rdb` that hasn't been processed yet)**
