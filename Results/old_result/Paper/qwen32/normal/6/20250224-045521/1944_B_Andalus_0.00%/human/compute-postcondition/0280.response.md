The code snippet provided initializes a variable `sz` to 0. The initial state mentions that `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list, but this information is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `sz`.

Output State: **`rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from the `rgt` list; `sz` is 0.**
