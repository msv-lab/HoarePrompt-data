Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rdb` has been processed up to the point where `sz` reaches `k` or the end of `rdb` is reached, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k`, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rdb` has been processed up to the point where `sz` reaches `k` or the end of `rdb` is reached, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 1, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop. `sng` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rdb` has been processed up to the point where `sz` reaches `k` or the end of `rdb` is reached, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 2, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. If `sz >= k`, the loop or the most internal block of code is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rdb` has been processed up to the point where `sz` reaches `k` or the end of `rdb` is reached, `sz` is the largest even number less than or equal to `k` plus 3, and the first `k` elements of `sng` have been printed. If `sz >= k`, the loop or the most internal block of code is exited. `elem` is the next element in `sng` after the `k`-th element. If `sz < k`, the execution continues without breaking out of the loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
