Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and `k` is now `k - mi * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`, `ans` is 2 if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `mi` is `min(a[0] + mi, a[n-1] + mi)`, `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is 1 if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `l` remains 0, and `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` was 0, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`.**
