Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is incremented to 1 if `mi * 2 <= k` or remains 0 otherwise, `r` is at least 1 if `l` is 0 or at least 2 if `l` is 1, `ans` is 2 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 1, `ans` is 4 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 3, `ans` is 3 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 2, `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 0, `ans` remains unchanged if `a[l] - t - k // 2 != 0`, and `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`.**
