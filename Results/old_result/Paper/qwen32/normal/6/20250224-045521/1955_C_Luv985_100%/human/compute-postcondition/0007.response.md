The code snippet `a = input().split()` takes an input string from the user, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `a`. The elements of this list are still strings and need to be converted to integers if numerical operations are to be performed on them.

Given the initial state, the variable `a` was previously a list of `n` integers. After executing the code, `a` is now a list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer (converted from the string `k`), `a` is a list of `n` strings where each string `a_i` is a substring of the input string split by whitespace.**
