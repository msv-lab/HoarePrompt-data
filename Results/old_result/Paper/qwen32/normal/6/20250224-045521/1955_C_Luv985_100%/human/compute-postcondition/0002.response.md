The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `T` is an input integer. Since `T` is an input integer, we must ensure that it is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9**
