Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` remains `T - 1`. `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same. `n` remains the same. `k` will be 0 if all possible reductions have been made, otherwise it will be the remaining value after the last reduction. `a` will have elements reduced to 0 where possible. `l` will be the index where no more reductions can be made from the left. `r` will be the index where no more reductions can be made from the right. `ans` will be the total number of elements that have been fully reduced to 0, incremented by 1 if `l == r` and `k >= a[l]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is unchanged, `k` is 0 or greater than 0 depending on the loop termination condition, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, `a` is a list of integers with some elements reduced to 0, `l` is incremented each time `a[l]` is reduced to 0, `r` is decremented each time `a[r]` is reduced to 0, and `ans` is the count of elements that have been reduced to 0 plus 1 if `k >= a[l]`. Additionally, `l` is equal to `r`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` is the final left pointer position, `r` is the final right pointer position, and `l` equals `r`. `k` is the remaining value of `k` (0 or the value that caused the loop to break). `t` is 0 or 1 based on the final value of `k`. `a` is the modified list after the loop. `ans` is the count of fully consumed elements. If `k >= a[l]`, `ans` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
