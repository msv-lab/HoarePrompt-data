Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0 and is now `k - mi * 2`, `T` is `T - 1`, `t` will be either 0 or 1 if the loop terminates due to `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise it remains the same, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in `input().split()` to integers with `a[0]` reduced by `mi` and `a[n - 1]` further reduced by `mi`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` (before the reduction), and `a[l]` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to 1. All other variables retain their previous states as specified in the initial conditions.
