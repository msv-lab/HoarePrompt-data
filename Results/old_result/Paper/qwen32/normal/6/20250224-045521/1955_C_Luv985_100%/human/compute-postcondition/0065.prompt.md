Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is the integer representation of the corresponding string from the input string split by whitespace, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4 (or `t` is either 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 > k`), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 (and `k` is now `k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`), `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi` and `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 1 if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `l` remains 0, `r` is `n - 2` if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`, `ans` is 2 if `a[r]` was 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and `mi` is `min(a[0] + mi, a[n-1] + mi)` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `mi` is `min(a[0], a[n-1])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4 (or `t` is either 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 > k`), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` and `a[r]` are adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is incremented to 1 if `mi * 2 <= k` or remains 0 otherwise, `r` is at least 1 if `l` is 0 or at least 2 if `l` is 1, `ans` is 1 if `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is 3 if `a[r]` is 0 and `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 2 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is 2 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0 and `mi * 2 > k` in the else part, `ans` remains 0 otherwise, and `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1 in the if part.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4 (or `t` is either 0 or 1 if `mi * 2 > k`), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 and is now `k - mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` are adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[l]` is adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k` and again if `mi * 2 <= k`, `a[r]` is adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k` and again if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is incremented to `l + 1` if `mi * 2 <= k` or remains `l` otherwise, `r` is at least 1 if `l` is 0 or at least 2 if `l` is 1, `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[r]` is 0 and `r` is now `r - 1` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is 2 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 1 if `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is 4 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 3 if `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is 3 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 2 if `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0` and was originally 0 if `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` remains unchanged if `a[l] - t - k // 2 != 0` if `mi * 2 > k`, and `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is updated to `k % 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
