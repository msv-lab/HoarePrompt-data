The code snippet converts each element of the list `a` from a string to an integer using the `map` function and a lambda function. The values of `T`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `a` now contains integers instead of strings.

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is the integer representation of the corresponding string from the input string split by whitespace.**
