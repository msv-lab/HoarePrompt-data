Output State: **`T` is an input integer, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The variable `T` is assigned the value of the input integer, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`) retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
