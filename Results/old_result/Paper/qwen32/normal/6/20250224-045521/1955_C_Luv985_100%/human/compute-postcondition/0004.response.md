The code snippet provided reads two values from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since `n` and `k` were initially defined as integers, after the `input().split()` operation, `n` and `k` will be strings. These strings will need to be converted to integers for any further arithmetic operations.

Given the initial state and the code execution, the new state will be:
- `T` remains `T - 1` (no change).
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (no change).
- `n` is now a string representing the first input value.
- `k` is now a string representing the second input value.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 (no change).

Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a string representing the first input value, `k` is a string representing the second input value, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9.**
