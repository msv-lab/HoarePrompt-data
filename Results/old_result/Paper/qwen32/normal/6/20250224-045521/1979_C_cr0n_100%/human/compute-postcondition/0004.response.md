To determine the output state, we need to understand the effect of the function `func_1(den, x)` on the variable `den`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code snippet, we cannot determine the exact value `den` will take after the function call. However, we can say that `den` is reassigned to the value returned by `func_1(den, x)`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes.
- `vals` is a list of integers with at least one element, and each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning.
- `den` is initially set to `vals[0]`.

After the code `den = func_1(den, x)` is executed, `den` will hold whatever value `func_1` returns.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and `den` is the value returned by `func_1(den, x)`.**
