Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires distributing a certain amount of coins across `n` outcomes such that the total coins bet is strictly less than the coins received back for each possible winning outcome, where the coins received back are the bet amount multiplied by a specific multiplier `k_i` for the winning outcome.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = a * b // GCD(a, b)`.
2. `func_2()`: This function reads the input for a test case, calculates the LCM of all multipliers `k_i`, and uses this LCM to determine the bets.

Here's the step-by-step logic of `func_2()`:
1. Read the number of outcomes `n`.
2. Read the list of multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
3. Calculate the LCM of all the multipliers.
4. For each multiplier `k_i`, calculate `vprod[i] = LCM / k_i`.
5. Calculate `den = LCM - sum(vprod)`.
6. If `den <= 0`, print `-1` because it's not possible to distribute the coins as required.
7. Otherwise, print the values in `vprod` as the bets.

### Correctness Check:
The main idea of the solution is to use the LCM of the multipliers to ensure that the bets can be distributed in such a way that the total bet is strictly less than the coins received for any winning outcome. However, the current implementation does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the coins received for any winning outcome.

Let's consider the example given in the problem:

For the test case:
```
3
3 2 7
```
The LCM of 3, 2, and 7 is 42. The `vprod` array would be `[14, 21, 6]` because:
- `42 / 3 = 14`
- `42 / 2 = 21`
- `42 / 7 = 6`

The sum of `vprod` is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, and `den = 42 - 41 = 1`. This means the bets are `[14, 21, 6]`, and the total bet is `41`. If the third outcome wins, the coins received are `7 * 6 = 42`, which is greater than `41`, so this seems correct for this case.

However, the key issue is that the program does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the coins received for any winning outcome in all cases. Specifically, the condition `den <= 0` only checks if the total bet is not greater than or equal to the LCM, but it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the coins received for each individual winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation does not always ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the coins received for any winning outcome, which is a requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all inputs.

Correctness: **False**
