Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes, `vals` is a list of integers with at least one element where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, `den` is the value returned by `func_1(den, x)`. `x` is the next element in `vals`.**

In natural language: The value of `den` has been updated to the value returned by `func_1(den, x)`. All other variables (`N`, `vals`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
