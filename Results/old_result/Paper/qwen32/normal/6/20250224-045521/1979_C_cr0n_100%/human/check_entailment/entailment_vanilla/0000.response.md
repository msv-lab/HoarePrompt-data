Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding:
The problem requires finding a way to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received if any one of the outcomes wins. Each outcome `i` has a multiplier `k_i` which determines how much is returned if that outcome wins.

### Program Analysis:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **func_1(a, b)**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.
   - It uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

2. **func_2()**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `N` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers in the `vals` list.
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier.
   - It calculates a value `den` which is the LCM minus the sum of the `vprod` list.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of coins is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the list `vprod` as the distribution of coins.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program attempts to find a solution by using the LCM of the multipliers. However, the logic used to determine the distribution (`vprod`) and the check (`den`) is flawed.
- The `vprod` list is constructed such that each element is the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier. This essentially means that the total bet (sum of `vprod`) would be equal to the LCM, which is not necessarily less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- The check `den = den - sum(vprod)` is incorrect because `den` is initially set to the LCM, and subtracting the sum of `vprod` (which is also the LCM) results in `den` being `0`. This makes the check `den <= 0` always true for non-trivial cases, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly determine a valid distribution of coins for the given problem. The logic used to compute the distribution and the check for its validity are incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
