The given Python code snippet creates a new list called `vprod` where each element is the result of integer division of `den` by the corresponding element in the list `vals`. 

Output State: **N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, vals is a list of integers where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, den is the value returned by applying func_1 iteratively to the initial den (which is vals[0]) and each subsequent element in vals, vprod is a list of integers where each element is the result of den // r for r in vals.**

This means that `vprod` is now a list of integers, where each integer is the result of dividing `den` by the respective element in the `vals` list using integer division. All other variables (`N`, `vals`, and `den`) retain their initial states.
