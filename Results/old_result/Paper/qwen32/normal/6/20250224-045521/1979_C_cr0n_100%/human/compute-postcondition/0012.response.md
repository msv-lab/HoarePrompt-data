Postcondition: **N is an integer representing the number of outcomes, vals is a list of integers where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, den is the value returned by applying func_1 iteratively to the initial den (which is vals[0]) and each subsequent element in vals minus the sum of vprod, vprod is a list of integers where each element is the result of den // r for r in vals. The current value of den is less than or equal to 0.**
