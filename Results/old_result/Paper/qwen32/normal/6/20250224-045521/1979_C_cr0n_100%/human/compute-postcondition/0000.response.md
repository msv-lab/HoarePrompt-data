The code snippet provided reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `vals` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `N` and the unchanged state of `vals`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the number of outcomes as input by the user, and `vals` is a list of integers representing the multipliers for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning. Each element in `vals` is an integer such that 2 <= vals[i] <= 20.**
