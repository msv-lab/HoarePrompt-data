You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives no direct input arguments. Instead, it reads input from standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5) representing the number of piles, and the next line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) representing the number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program returns None and prints 'Alice'
    #State: `N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input line, and the length of `nums` is greater than 1.
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program returns None because `print('Bob')` outputs 'Bob' to the console and the return statement returns None.
    #State: `N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input line, and the length of `nums` is greater than 2.
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `N` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input line with `0` inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 3; `cd` is the number of consecutive elements starting from `nums[0]` where the difference between consecutive elements is 1.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program returns None after printing 'Bob'
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program returns Alice
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any direct input parameters. It reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it determines the winner of a game based on the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. The function prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' to the console for each test case, indicating the winner. The function does not return any value (implicitly returns `None`).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None and prints 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns None because `print('Bob')` outputs 'Bob' to the console and the return statement returns None.

Case_3: The program returns None after printing 'Bob'

Case_4: The program returns Alice


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
