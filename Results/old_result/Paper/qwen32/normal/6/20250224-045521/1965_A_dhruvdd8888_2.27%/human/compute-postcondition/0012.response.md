Postcondition: **N is an integer representing the number of test cases; `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from the input line with `0` inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is now greater than 3; `cd` is 0. Additionally, the difference between `nums[i + 1]` and `nums[i]` is 1.**
