Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The logic used in the program is incorrect and does not account for the optimal moves that Alice and Bob would make in the game.

The game described is a variant of Nim, specifically a subtraction game where players can only remove the same number of stones from all non-empty piles in one move. The key to solving this game is to determine the Grundy number (or Nim-sum) of the game position. The Grundy number for a pile of size `x` is `x` itself in this game. The overall Grundy number for the game is the XOR of the Grundy numbers of all piles. If the overall Grundy number is zero, the position is losing for the player about to move (Alice in this case), otherwise it is winning.

Here is a corrected version of the program that uses the correct logic:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    grundy = 0
    for pile in piles:
        grundy ^= pile
    if grundy == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')
```

This program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of piles and the number of stones in each pile. It calculates the Grundy number for the game position by XORing the number of stones in each pile. If the Grundy number is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
