The code snippet `mod_y_key = num % y` calculates the modulus of `num` with `y` and assigns it to `mod_y_key`. Given the initial state, `num` is not explicitly defined in the provided variables. However, based on the context, `num` seems to be the first element of the current test case tuple in `test_cases`. Since `test_cases` is a list of tuples, and we are not iterating through it in the provided code, we can assume that `num` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases` for the purpose of this calculation.

The first tuple in `test_cases` is `(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, so `num` is `5`. Given `y` is `8`, the calculation is `5 % 8`, which equals `5`.

Therefore, `mod_y_key` is updated to `5`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `0`; `mod_x_map` is `{}`; `mod_y_map` is `{}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`; `mod_x` is `0`; `mod_y` is `6`; `mod_x_key` is `2`; `mod_y_key` is `5`.**
