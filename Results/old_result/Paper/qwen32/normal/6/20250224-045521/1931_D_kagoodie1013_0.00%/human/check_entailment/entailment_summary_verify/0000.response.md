Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment based on the problem description and function summary.

### Problem Description Recap:
A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) (where \(1 \le i < j \le n\)) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

### Program Analysis:
The program uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively. 

#### Key Points:
1. **Modular Arithmetic for Condition 1**:
   - For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by \(x\), \((a_i \% x + a_j \% x) \% x\) should be 0. This means that \(a_i \% x\) and \(a_j \% x\) should be complements of each other modulo \(x\). However, the program uses `mod_x = -num % x` to track the complements, which is incorrect. The correct approach would be to track the counts of each remainder directly and then find pairs that sum to 0 modulo \(x\).

2. **Modular Arithmetic for Condition 2**:
   - For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by \(y\), \((a_i \% y - a_j \% y) \% y\) should be 0. This means that \(a_i \% y\) and \(a_j \% y\) should be the same. The program correctly uses `mod_y = num % y` for this condition.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly points out that the use of `-num % x` is incorrect for the first condition. The program should track the counts of remainders directly and then find pairs that sum to 0 modulo \(x\).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the solution:
1. Use `mod_x = num % x` and `mod_y = num % y`.
2. For each element in the array, check how many previous elements have the required complement modulo \(x\) and the same remainder modulo \(y\).
3. Update the counts of remainders in the dictionaries.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the use of `-num % x`. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
