The code provided increments the variable `count` by the sum of the values retrieved from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` for the keys `mod_x` and `mod_y` respectively. If the keys do not exist in the dictionaries, the `get` method returns 0 by default.

Given that `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are both empty dictionaries, `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` will both return 0. Therefore, `count` will be incremented by 0 + 0, which means `count` remains unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` must be a list with at least one element; `mod_x` is 2; `mod_y` is 3**.
