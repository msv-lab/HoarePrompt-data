The code snippet `mod_y = num % y` calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to `mod_y`. Given the initial state, `num` is the second element of `arr`, and `y` is 8. Since `arr` contains at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, which for the given test cases could be 2 or 7.

Let's evaluate the possible values of `mod_y` for the provided test cases:
1. If `arr` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `num` is 2. `mod_y = 2 % 8` results in `mod_y = 2`.
2. If `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, then `num` is 7. `mod_y = 7 % 8` results in `mod_y = 7`.

Therefore, `mod_y` can be either 2 or 7 based on the test cases provided.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is {1: 1}; `mod_y_map` is {1: 1} or {6: 1} or {1: 2} or {6: 2}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is a list with at least two elements; `num` is the second element of `arr`; `mod_x` is either 2 or 1; `mod_y` is either 2 or 7; `mod_x_key` is 1; `mod_y_key` is either 1 or 6`.**
