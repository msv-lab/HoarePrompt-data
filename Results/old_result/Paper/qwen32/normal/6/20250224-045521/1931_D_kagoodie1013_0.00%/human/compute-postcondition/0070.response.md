The code snippet assigns the value of `num % y` to `mod_y_key`. Given that `num` is the first element of `arr` and `arr` has at least one element, and considering the initial state where `arr` is a list with at least one element and `y` is 8, we need to determine the value of `num % y`.

Since `arr` is a list with at least one element and `num` is the first element of `arr`, let's consider the possible values of `num` based on the provided `test_cases`. The first test case has `arr` as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, so `num` could be 1. The second test case has `arr` as `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, so `num` could be 6. However, since `num` is specified as the first element of `arr` and the initial state does not specify which test case is currently being processed, we can consider both possibilities.

If `num` is 1, then `mod_y_key` becomes `1 % 8`, which is 1.
If `num` is 6, then `mod_y_key` becomes `6 % 8`, which is 6.

Given that `mod_y` is either 1 or 6, and `mod_y_key` is now equal to `num % y`, `mod_y_key` will be either 1 or 6 depending on the value of `num`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is {}; `mod_y_map` is {}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is a list with at least one element; `num` is the first element of `arr`; `mod_x` is 3; `mod_y` is either 1 or 6; `mod_x_key` is 1; `mod_y_key` is either 1 or 6.**
