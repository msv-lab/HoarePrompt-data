Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 1; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{2: 1}`; `arr` must be a list with at least two elements; `mod_x` is 0; `mod_y` is 2; `mod_y_key` is 2; `num` is the second element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by the sum of the values retrieved from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` using `mod_x` and `mod_y` as keys, respectively. Since `mod_x` is 0 and `mod_y` is 2, `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` returns 0 (as `mod_x_map` does not contain the key 0) and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` returns 1 (as `mod_y_map` contains the key 2 with the value 1). Therefore, `count` is incremented by 1, making `count` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
