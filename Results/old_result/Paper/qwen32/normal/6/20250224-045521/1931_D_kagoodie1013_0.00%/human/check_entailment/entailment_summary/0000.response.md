### Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array for multiple test cases. A pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The program uses modular arithmetic to efficiently count these pairs. Specifically, for each element in the array, it calculates the modular properties relative to \(x\) and \(y\) and uses hash maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of these modular values.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Modular Arithmetic for \(a_i + a_j\):**
   - For a pair to satisfy \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\), it must be that \(-a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{x}\).
   - Therefore, for each element `num` in the array, the program calculates `mod_x = -num % x` and uses a map (`mod_x_map`) to count how many times this value has appeared before. This effectively counts how many previous elements can form a beautiful pair with the current element based on the first condition.

2. **Modular Arithmetic for \(a_i - a_j\):**
   - For a pair to satisfy \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\), it must be that \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).
   - Therefore, for each element `num` in the array, the program calculates `mod_y = num % y` and uses a map (`mod_y_map`) to count how many times this value has appeared before. This effectively counts how many previous elements can form a beautiful pair with the current element based on the second condition.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each element in the array, the program adds the counts from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to the total count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the maps with the current element's modular values.

The program iterates through each element of the array once, making it efficient with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) per test case, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Correctness:

Given the provided logic and the constraints of the problem, the program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case. The modular arithmetic approach ensures that both conditions for a beautiful pair are checked efficiently.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
