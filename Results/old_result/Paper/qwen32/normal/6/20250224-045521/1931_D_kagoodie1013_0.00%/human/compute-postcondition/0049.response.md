The code snippet updates the value in the `mod_x_map` dictionary for the key `mod_x_key` (which is `2`). The value is incremented by 1, so the new value for the key `2` in `mod_x_map` will be `2`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `1`; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 2}`; `mod_y_map` is `{5: 1}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`; `mod_x` is `2`; `mod_y` is `2`; `mod_x_key` is `2`; `mod_y_key` is `2`; `num` is `10`.**
