The code snippet `mod_x = -num % x` calculates the value of `-num % x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. Given the initial state, `num` is not explicitly defined, but based on the context of the `test_cases` list, we can infer that `num` corresponds to the third element of each tuple in `test_cases`. For the current context, `num` is `8` (from the second tuple in `test_cases`).

Let's calculate `mod_x`:
- `num` is `8`
- `x` is `4`
- `-num % x` is `-8 % 4`, which equals `0` in Python because the modulo operation returns the remainder of the division, and the sign of the result matches the divisor.

Thus, `mod_x` is `0`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `0`; `mod_x_map` is `{}`; `mod_y_map` is `{}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`; `mod_x` is `0`.**
