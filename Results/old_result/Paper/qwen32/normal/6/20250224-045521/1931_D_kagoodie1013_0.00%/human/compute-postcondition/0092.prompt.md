Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) representing the elements of the array; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x_map = {}
    mod_y_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        mod_x = -num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
        mod_x_key = num % x
        mod_y_key = num % y
        mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
        mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `6`; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 3, 1: 3, 0: 1}`; `mod_y_map` is `{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: test_cases is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; results is [6, 13]; count is 13; mod_x_map is {2: 4, 0: 1, 1: 1}; mod_y_map is {5: 1, 2: 5, 0: 1, 1: 1}; n is 6; x is 4; y is 8; arr is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13, 3]; `count` is 3; `mod_x_map` is {2: 2, 3: 2, 0: 1, 1: 1}; `mod_y_map` is {6: 1, 7: 1, 0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
