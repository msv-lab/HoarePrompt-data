Output State: **`test_cases` is [(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]; `results` is [6, 13]; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is {}; `mod_y_map` is {}; `n` is 6; `x` is 4; `y` is 8; `arr` is a list with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`; `mod_x` is 3; `mod_y` is either 1 or 6`.**

Explanation: The value of `count` is updated by adding the values retrieved from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` using `mod_x` and `mod_y` as keys, respectively. Since both `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are empty dictionaries, the values retrieved are 0, and thus `count` remains 0. All other variables retain their initial values.
