To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

The code snippet is:
```python
mod_x = -num % x
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`
- `results` is an empty list
- `count` is 0
- `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary
- `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary
- `arr` must be a list with at least one element

However, the variables `num` and `x` are not defined in the initial state. Since these variables are used in the code snippet, we need to infer their values from the `test_cases` list. The first element of `test_cases` is a tuple `(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, which suggests that `x` could be 5 and `num` could be 3 (based on common unpacking practices).

Let's assume `x = 5` and `num = 3` for the calculation:
- `mod_x = -num % x` translates to `mod_x = -3 % 5`

Now, let's calculate `-3 % 5`:
- The modulus operation `-3 % 5` results in `2` because `-3 + 5 = 2` and `2` is the remainder when `-3` is divided by `5`.

So, `mod_x` is assigned the value `2`.

The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`, `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])]`; `results` is an empty list; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; `arr` must be a list with at least one element; `mod_x` is 2**.
