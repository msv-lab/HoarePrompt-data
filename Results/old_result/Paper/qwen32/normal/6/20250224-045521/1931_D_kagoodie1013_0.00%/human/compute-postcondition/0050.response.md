The code snippet `mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1` increments the value associated with the key `mod_y_key` in the dictionary `mod_y_map` by 1. Given that `mod_y_key` is `2`, the value associated with this key in `mod_y_map` is initially `2`. After the increment, the value will be `3`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is `[(5, 3, 7, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), (6, 4, 8, [6, 7, 8, 9, 10])]`; `results` is `[6]`; `count` is `1`; `mod_x_map` is `{2: 2}`; `mod_y_map` is `{5: 1, 2: 3}`; `n` is `6`; `x` is `4`; `y` is `8`; `arr` is `[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`; `mod_x` is `2`; `mod_y` is `2`; `mod_x_key` is `2`; `mod_y_key` is `2`; `num` is `10`.**
