Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a logical error in the calculation of `mod_x`. The calculation `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect for the problem's requirements. The condition for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful is that \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). 

The correct approach involves checking the remainders of \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) when divided by \(x\) and \(y\). Specifically, for the sum condition, \(a_i \mod x\) and \(a_j \mod x\) should sum to a multiple of \(x\). For the difference condition, \(a_i \mod y\) and \(a_j \mod y\) should be equal.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = [0] * x
        mod_y_map = [0] * y
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map[(x - mod_x) % x] * mod_y_map[mod_y]
            mod_x_map[mod_x] += 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y] += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

In this corrected version, `mod_x_map` keeps track of the count of each remainder when elements are divided by `x`, and `mod_y_map` keeps track of the count of each remainder when elements are divided by `y`. For each element, we check how many previous elements have the required remainders to form a beautiful pair.
