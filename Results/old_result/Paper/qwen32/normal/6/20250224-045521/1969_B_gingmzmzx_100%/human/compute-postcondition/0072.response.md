To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the provided initial state and the context.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **cnt is `[zeroes, len(s) - zeroes]`**:
   - `cnt` is a list with two elements.
   - The first element, `zeroes`, represents the count of `0`s in some string or list `s`.
   - The second element, `len(s) - zeroes`, represents the count of `1`s in the same string or list `s`.

2. **ans is the sum of contributions from each `0` and `1` based on the loop rules**:
   - `ans` is calculated by summing contributions from each `0` and `1` in `s`.
   - The exact loop rules are not provided, but we can infer that `ans` is a cumulative sum of some values derived from the counts of `0`s and `1`s.

### Calculation of `ans`:
Without the exact loop rules, we can't compute the precise value of `ans`. However, we can describe `ans` in terms of the counts of `0`s and `1`s.

### Output Description:
The `print(ans)` statement will output the calculated value of `ans`, which is the sum of contributions from each `0` and `1` in `s` based on the loop rules.

Since the exact loop rules are not provided, we can't determine the numerical value of `ans`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the known components.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of contributions from each `0` and `1` in `s` based on the loop rules)**
