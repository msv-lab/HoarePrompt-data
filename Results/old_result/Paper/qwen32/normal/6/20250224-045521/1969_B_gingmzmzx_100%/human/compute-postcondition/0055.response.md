The code snippet provided increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. The variables `ans`, `n`, `s`, and `zeroes` are not affected by this operation.

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is `[0, 0]`
- `ans` is `0`
- `n` is decremented by 1 (though the exact value of `n` is not specified, we know it is one less than its previous value)
- `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 element
- `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`

After executing `cnt[c] += 1`:
- The value at index `c` in `cnt` will be incremented by 1.
- If `c` is `0`, then `cnt` becomes `[1, 0]`.
- If `c` is `1`, then `cnt` becomes `[0, 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[1, 0]` if `c` is `0`, or `cnt` is `[0, 1]` if `c` is `1`; `ans` is `0`; `n` is decremented by 1; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 element; `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`.**
