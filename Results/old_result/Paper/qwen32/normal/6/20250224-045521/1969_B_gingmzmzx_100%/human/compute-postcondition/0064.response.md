Output State: **`cnt` is `[2, 0]` if `c` is `0`, or `[0, 2]` if `c` is `1`; `ans` is `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`; `n` is decremented by 1; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 element; `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`; `c` is the next element in the list `s`.**

In natural language: The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`. The values of `cnt`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `c` remain as described in the initial state.
