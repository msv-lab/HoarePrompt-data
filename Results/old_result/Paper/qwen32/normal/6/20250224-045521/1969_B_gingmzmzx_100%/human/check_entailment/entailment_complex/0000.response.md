### Reasoning:

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum cost to make each binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).
   - It counts the total number of 0s in the string (`zeroes`).

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - It initializes `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to accumulate the total cost.

3. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - It updates the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is `0`, it adds `1` to `ans` if there have been any `1`s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). This is because a `0` after a `1` would require a shift to bring the `0` to the front, incurring a cost of 1.
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining `0`s (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This is because each `1` before a `0` needs to be shifted past all remaining `0`s, incurring a cost equal to the number of remaining `0`s.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing each string, it prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic seems to be based on the idea that each `1` that appears before a `0` needs to be shifted past all remaining `0`s, and each `0` that appears after a `1` needs to be shifted to the front.
- The cost calculation appears to be correct in the context of the problem, as it accounts for the number of shifts required to sort the string in non-descending order.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort each binary string in non-descending order using the described cyclic shifts. The logic aligns with the problem requirements, and the implementation appears to be correct.

**Correctness: True**
