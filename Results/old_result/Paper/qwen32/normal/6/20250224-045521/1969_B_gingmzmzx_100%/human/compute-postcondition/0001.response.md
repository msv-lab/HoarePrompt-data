To determine the necessary state adjustments for the given for loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute `n` times.

The variables in the loop head are:
- `_` (which is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted)
- `n` (which determines how many times the loop will execute)

The state provided before the loop starts includes:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- Each of the following `t` lines contains a binary string `s` such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5
- `n` is an input integer

Since the loop will execute `n` times, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`. The value of `n` determines whether the loop will execute at all. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute.

The states of `t` and the binary strings `s` are not directly related to the execution of the for loop, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following t lines contains a binary string s such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; `n` is an integer such that `n` must be greater than 0**
