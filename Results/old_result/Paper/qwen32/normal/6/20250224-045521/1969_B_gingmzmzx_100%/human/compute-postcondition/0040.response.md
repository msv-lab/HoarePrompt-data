The code snippet `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to it. The values of `cnt`, `n`, `s`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this statement.

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is either `[1, 1]` if the previous `c` is 0, otherwise `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` with one of the elements incremented by 1.
- `ans` is 0 or 1 if the previous `c` is 0, otherwise `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and has at least 1 element.
- `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`.
- `c` is the next element in `s`.

After executing the code snippet:
- `ans` is updated to `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`.

The Output State is:
Output State: **`cnt` is either `[1, 1]` if the previous `c` is 0, otherwise `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` with one of the elements incremented by 1; `ans` is `ans + (zeroes - cnt[0])`; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and has at least 1 element; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`; `c` is the next element in `s`.**
