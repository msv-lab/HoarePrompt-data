Postcondition: **`cnt` is `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[0, 0]` with one of the elements incremented by 1. `ans` is 0 or 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `ans + zeroes - cnt[0]`. `n` is decremented by 1 in both cases. `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and has at least 1 element. `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`. `c` is either 0 or not 0.**
