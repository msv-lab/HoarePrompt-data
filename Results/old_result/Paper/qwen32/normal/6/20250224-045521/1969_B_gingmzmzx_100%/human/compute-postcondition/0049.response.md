The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `n`. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable that does not affect the state of the program, and `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. Since `_` is not relevant to the state, we only need to adjust `n` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `cnt` is `[number of 0s in s, number of 1s in s]`, `ans` is the calculated sum based on the described logic.

Since the loop is controlled by `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 from its current value (assuming `n` is greater than 0).

State: **`cnt` is `[number of 0s in s, number of 1s in s]`, `ans` is the calculated sum based on the described logic, `n` is decremented by 1**
