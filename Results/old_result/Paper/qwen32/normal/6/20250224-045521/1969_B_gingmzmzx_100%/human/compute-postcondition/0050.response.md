The code snippet provided takes a string input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts each character to an integer, and then stores the result in the list `s`. This means that the variable `s` is now a list of integers derived from the input string. The variables `cnt`, `ans`, and `n` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[number of 0s in s, number of 1s in s]`, `ans` is the calculated sum based on the described logic, `n` is decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string.**
