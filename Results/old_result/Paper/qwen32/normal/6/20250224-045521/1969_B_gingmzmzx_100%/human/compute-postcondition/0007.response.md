The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Given that `cnt` is initialized to `[0, 0]`, this means that if `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` will be incremented by 1, and if `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` will be incremented by 1. The value of `c` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine which specific element of `cnt` will be incremented. However, we can describe the possible outcomes based on the value of `c`.

Since `c` can only be 0 or 1 (as `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1), the possible output states are:
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` will be `[1, 0]`.
- If `c` is 1, `cnt` will be `[0, 1]`.

Given the initial state, the only variable that changes is `cnt`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `zeroes`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following t lines contains a binary string s such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; `n` is an integer such that `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing the binary string read from the input; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`; `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1]; `ans` is 0**
