Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using the cyclic shift operation.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:** The code attempts to calculate the cost by iterating through the string and checking the number of 0s and 1s, but it does not correctly account for the cost of cyclically shifting substrings to achieve a sorted order.

2. **Logic Flaw:** The code logic seems to be based on counting the number of inversions or transitions between 0s and 1s, but it does not correctly map this to the cost of cyclic shifts. For example, in the string "101011", the code might count the number of 1s before a 0 and add to the cost, but this does not reflect the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string.

### Example where the Code Fails:
Consider the input string "101011". The correct minimum cost to sort this string is 5, as described in the problem statement. However, the provided code does not compute this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one would need to consider the following:
- Identify the longest prefix of the string that is already sorted.
- Determine the number of cyclic shifts required to bring all 0s to the beginning and all 1s to the end.
- Calculate the cost of these shifts based on the length of the substrings being shifted.

Given the complexity of the problem, a more detailed and correct implementation would be required. The provided code does not meet these requirements and thus is incorrect.
