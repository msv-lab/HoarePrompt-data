The variable `zeroes` is assigned the count of `0` in the list `s`. The values of `cnt`, `ans`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`cnt` is `[number of 0s in s, number of 1s in s]`, `ans` is the calculated sum based on the described logic, `n` is decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string, `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`.**
