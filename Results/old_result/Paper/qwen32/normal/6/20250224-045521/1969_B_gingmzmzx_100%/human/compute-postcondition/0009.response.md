The provided code snippet increments `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. The values of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Since `cnt` is either `[1, 0]` or `[0, 1]`, `cnt[1]` will be 1 in one case and 0 in the other. Therefore, `ans` will be incremented by 1 if `cnt` is `[1, 0]`, and it will remain unchanged if `cnt` is `[0, 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each of the following t lines contains a binary string s such that 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5; `n` is an integer such that `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1, representing the binary string read from the input; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the list `s`; `cnt` is either [1, 0] or [0, 1]; `ans` is 1 if `cnt` is [1, 0], otherwise `ans` is 0; `c` is 0.**
