The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count at the index `c` in the list `cnt`. Given the initial state, `cnt` is a list of two integers, and `c` is the next element in the list `s` which can be either 0 or 1.

If `c` is 0, `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is 1, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1. The values of `ans`, `n`, `s`, and `zeroes` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[cnt[0] + 1, cnt[1]]` if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is `[cnt[0], cnt[1] + 1]`; `ans` is unchanged; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string and has at least 1 element; `zeroes` is the count of 0s in `s`; `c` is the next element in `s`.**
