Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine if it solves the problem correctly.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost. The cost is defined as the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort the string for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to follow a specific logic to determine the minimum cost. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:** The program reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. **Counting Zeroes:** For each test case, it converts the string into a list of integers and counts the number of zeroes.
3. **Tracking Counts:** It initializes a count array `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far.
4. **Calculating Cost:** It iterates through the string and updates the cost `ans` based on the counts of zeroes and ones:
   - If the current character is `0`, it adds `1` to the cost if there are any `1`s encountered before (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
   - If the current character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost.
5. **Output:** Finally, it prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Logic Verification:
The logic used in the program seems to be based on the idea that:
- Each time we encounter a `0` after a `1`, we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring that `0` to the front of the sequence of `1`s. This is counted as `1` operation.
- Each time we encounter a `1`, we need to perform cyclic shifts for all remaining `0`s to bring them before this `1`. This is counted as the number of remaining `0`s.

However, this logic does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts. The cost is the length of the substring being shifted, not just `1` or the number of remaining `0`s. The provided program does not correctly calculate the cost of the cyclic shifts required to sort the string.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
