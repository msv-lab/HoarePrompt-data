Reasoning:  
Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem requirements. The goal is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` is `r - l + 1`.

The provided program calculates the minimum cost as follows:
1. It counts the total number of 0s in the string.
2. It iterates through the string, maintaining a count of 0s and 1s encountered so far (`cnt`).
3. For each character in the string:
   - If the character is 0 and there have been 1s encountered before, it adds 1 to the cost (`ans`). This suggests that each 0 encountered after at least one 1 contributes a cost of 1 because it needs to be moved past the 1s.
   - If the character is 1, it adds the number of remaining 0s (total 0s minus the count of 0s encountered so far) to the cost. This suggests that each 1 needs to be moved past all the remaining 0s, contributing a cost equal to the number of remaining 0s.

This approach seems to be based on the idea of counting the inversions in the binary string, where an inversion is a pair of characters where a 1 appears before a 0. The cost to fix each inversion is considered to be 1 for a 0 following a 1 and the number of remaining 0s for a 1 preceding 0s.

However, the problem requires the cost to be the length of the substring being cyclically shifted. The provided program does not calculate the cost based on the length of any substring being shifted; instead, it calculates a cost based on the number of inversions.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to consider the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts on substrings to sort the string. The provided program's logic does not align with the problem's requirements for calculating the cost of cyclic shifts.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
