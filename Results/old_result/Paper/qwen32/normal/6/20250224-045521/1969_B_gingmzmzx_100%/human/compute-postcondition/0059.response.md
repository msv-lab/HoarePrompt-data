The code snippet `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `cnt` is `[0, 1]` if `c` is `1`, we know that `cnt[0]` is `0`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + zeroes - 0`, which simplifies to `ans + zeroes`.

Output State: **`cnt` is `[0, 1]` if `c` is `1`; `ans` is `ans + zeroes`; `n` is decremented by 1; `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 element; `zeroes` is the count of `0` in `s`; `c` is not `0`**.
