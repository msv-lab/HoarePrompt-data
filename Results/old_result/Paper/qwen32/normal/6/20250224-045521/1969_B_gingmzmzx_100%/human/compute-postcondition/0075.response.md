Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes a series of binary strings, each representing a test case. For each binary string, it calculates a value based on the number of 0s and 1s in the string and prints this value. The function handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each binary string having a length between 2 and 200,000 characters, and the total length of all binary strings not exceeding 200,000 characters.**
