The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables for the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m` and `k` must be greater than 0. According to the `for` loop statement, `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than the current value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `i` is `m + 1`, `k` must be greater than `m + 1`**
