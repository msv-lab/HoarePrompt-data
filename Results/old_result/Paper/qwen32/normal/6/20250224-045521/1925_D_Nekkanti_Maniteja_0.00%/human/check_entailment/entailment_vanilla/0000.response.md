Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for excursions, modulo \(10^9+7\). The expected value is expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\), and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7)\).

### Key Points:
1. **Friendship Value Calculation**: 
   - Initially, the friendship values of all pairs are given.
   - Each time a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs needs to be calculated.

2. **Expected Value**:
   - For each pair of friends, the probability of being chosen in a single excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in k excursions is \(k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair after k excursions is the sum of the first \(k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\) natural numbers, which is \(\frac{(k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}) \cdot (k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} + 1)}{2}\).

3. **Overall Expected Value**:
   - The total expected value is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values for all pairs.
   - The expected increase for all pairs is the sum of the expected increases for each pair, which can be simplified to \(\frac{2mk(k \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} + 1)}{2n(n-1)}\).

### Program Analysis:
Let's examine the provided program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` calculates the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs \(\binom{n}{2}\) modulo \(10^9+7\).

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - `a += f` accumulates the sum of the initial friendship values.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` is incorrect. It attempts to calculate the expected value incrementally, but it doesn't correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values.
   - The formula inside the loop `c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect and does not represent the correct expected value calculation.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The logic for computing the expected increase in friendship values is incorrect, and the loop does not properly sum up the expected values.

**Correctness: False**
