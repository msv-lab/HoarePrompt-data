The code snippet provided sets the variable `a` to 0. This change affects the value of `a`, while all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**.

In natural language: The variable `a` has been reset to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values.
