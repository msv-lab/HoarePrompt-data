The code snippet updates the value of `s` by adding the result of `c * i * c * m + c * a` to it. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new value of `s` is calculated as the sum of its previous value and the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `i` is `m`, `k` must be greater than 0**.
