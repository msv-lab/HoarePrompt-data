The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer value read from the input. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m + k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the integer value read from the input must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers as read from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `M`, `s` is `c^2 * m * (k-1) * k / 2 + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values read from the input, `i` is `m + k`**
