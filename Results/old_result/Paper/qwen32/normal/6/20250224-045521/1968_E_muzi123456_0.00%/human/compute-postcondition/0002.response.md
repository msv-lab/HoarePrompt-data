The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 50. After the operation, the value of `t` will be in the range 0 <= t <= 49. The value of `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 49, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3 for each of the `t` test cases.**
