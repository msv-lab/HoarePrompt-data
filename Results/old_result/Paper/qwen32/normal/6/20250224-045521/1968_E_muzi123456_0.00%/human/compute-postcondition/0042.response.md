Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `n` is the input integer
- `i` is `n + 1`

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' ')
```

### Analysis:
The print statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print(' ')
```
This statement is printing a single space character.

### Explanation:
- The value of `t`, `n`, and `i` are derived from the initial state, but they are not used in the print statement. The print statement is explicitly printing a space character.

### Output:
Since the print statement is explicitly printing a space character, the output will be a single space.

Output: ** ** (a single space)**
