The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (non-zero), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero.

Given that `t` is `t - n` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `t - n` is non-zero. Since `n` is the same as the initial value and `i` is `n + 1`, we don't need to adjust `n` or `i` because they are not part of the loop head condition.

To ensure `t - n` is non-zero, `t` must be greater than `n` (assuming `n` is positive). Therefore, `t` must be adjusted to be greater than its current value of `t - n`.

State: **`t` must be greater than `n`, `n` is the same as the initial value, `i` is `n + 1`**
