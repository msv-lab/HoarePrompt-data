Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case requires the user to output `n` points on an `n x n` grid that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. However, the current implementation of the function does not achieve this goal.

The function simply prints points along the first row of the grid, i.e., `(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, n)`. This strategy does not maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, with `n=3`, the points `(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)` will result in a set of Manhattan distances of `{0, 1, 2}`, which is not optimal. The optimal arrangement for `n=3` should be something like `(2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1)` which results in a set of Manhattan distances of `{0, 1, 2, 3}`.

To maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, a more strategic placement of points is required, such as placing points on a diagonal with some offset or in a pattern that maximizes the variety of distances.

Given the current implementation, it is clear that the program does not provide the correct solution for maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **False**
