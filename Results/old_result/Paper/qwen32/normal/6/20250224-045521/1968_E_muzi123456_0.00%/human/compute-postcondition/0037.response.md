Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `t` is defined as `t - 1`. However, the value of `t` itself is not explicitly given, and it seems to be a recursive or iterative definition that isn't providing a concrete initial value.
- `n` must be at least 1. This indicates a constraint on the variable `n` but does not specify its exact value.
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1 in the initial state.
- The `print(i)` statement will simply output the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Since the value of `i` is explicitly given as 1, the print statement will output 1.

### Output:
Output: **1**
