To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the loop's behavior and the given initial conditions.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print('1', end=' ')
    print(i)
```

This loop iterates from `1` to `n` (inclusive), printing `1` followed by the current value of `i` in each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1` (which is a static state and does not change during the loop)
- `n` is an input integer
- `i` is `n + 1` (which is the initial value before the loop starts, but `i` gets reassigned in the loop)

From the provided output states after the first 3 iterations:
- After 1 iteration: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`
- After 2 iterations: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1
- After 3 iterations: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2

We can infer that `i` is the loop variable and its value changes with each iteration. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n + 1` because the loop's range is `range(1, n + 1)`, and `i` will be incremented until it reaches `n + 1`.

Thus, after all iterations, the state of the variables will be:
- `t` remains `t - 1` (unchanged)
- `n` remains the input integer (unchanged)
- `i` will be `n + 1` (final value after the loop completes)

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `i` is `n + 1`**. 

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` remains unchanged as `t - 1`, the variable `n` remains the input integer, and the variable `i` will be `n + 1`, which is the value it takes after the loop completes its range.
