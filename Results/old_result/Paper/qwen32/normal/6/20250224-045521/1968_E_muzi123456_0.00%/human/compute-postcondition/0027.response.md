To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the code and the given information.

The loop in question is:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print('1', end=' ')
    print(i)
```

The loop iterates from `1` to `n` (inclusive). This means it will execute `n` times. From the output states given after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can infer the following:

- After 1 iteration: `i` is `1`, and `n` must be at least `1`.
- After 2 iterations: `i` is `1` at the start of the second iteration, and `n` must be at least `1`.
- After 3 iterations: `i` is `2` at the start of the third iteration, and `n` must be at least `2`.

From this, we can conclude that after `n` iterations, `i` will be `n` at the start of the final iteration, and `n` must be at least `n`.

After all iterations are complete, the loop variable `i` will be `n + 1` because the `for` loop in Python increments `i` after each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `n + 1`.

The variable `t` is mentioned in the initial state and is decremented by `1` after each iteration, but it is not affected by the loop body itself. Therefore, after `n` iterations, `t` will be `t - n`.

The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.

Thus, the output state after all iterations is:
- `t` is `t - n`
- `n` is the same as the initial value
- `i` is `n + 1`

Output State: **t is `t - n`, n is the same as the initial value, i is `n + 1`.**

In natural language: After all iterations, `t` is reduced by the number of times the loop ran (`n`), `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is `n + 1`.
