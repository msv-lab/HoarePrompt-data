The `print(i)` statement will output the value of the variable `i`. According to the initial state, `i` is an integer such that \(3 \leq i \leq n\), where `n` is another integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified within the given range, we cannot determine a single numerical value for `i`. However, we know that `i` must be an integer within the specified range.

Output: **i (where i is an integer such that 3 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 1000)**
