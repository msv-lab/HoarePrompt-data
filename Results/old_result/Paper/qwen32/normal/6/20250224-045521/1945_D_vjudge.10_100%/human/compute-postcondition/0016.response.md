Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. `pergunta` is a list of integers representing the number of test cases. `a` and `b` are 2D lists of integers where each sublist contains `n` integers representing the `a_i` and `b_i` values for each test case, respectively. `n` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of people in the queue for each test case, and `m` is a list of integers where each integer represents the maximum allowable final position of Kirill for each test case. The function returns a list of results for each test case. For each test case, if it is possible for Kirill to end up in a position no greater than `m` based on the given `a_i` and `b_i` values, the function returns "YES"; otherwise, it returns "NO".**
