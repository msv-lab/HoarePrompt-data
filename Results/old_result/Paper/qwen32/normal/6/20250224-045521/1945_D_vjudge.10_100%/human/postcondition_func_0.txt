The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by lists `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a value `x` as the sum of the minimums of corresponding elements in `a` and `b` from the end to the beginning. It then updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`. The function prints the final value of `pergunta` for each test case.
