Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to identify the issues.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue. Kirill can swap places with any person in front of him, paying `a_j` coins to swap with the `j`-th person and `b_k` coins to each person between `j` and `i` (where `j < k < i`).

### Provided Code Analysis
The provided code has a few issues:
1. **Function Call**: The `func_1` function is called with `pergunta` initialized to `float('inf')`, but this value is not properly updated or returned.
2. **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation**: The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first `m` positions.
3. **Loop and Indexing**: The loop iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, but the logic for calculating the cost is not correctly implemented. It does not account for the correct number of coins to be paid to the people between `j` and `i`.

### Potential Incorrect Case
Let's consider the following test case:
```
1
5 3
7 3 6 9 2
4 3 8 5 1
```

#### Expected Output:
The minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first 3 positions is `5` (swapping with the person at position 4, paying `2` coins and `3` coins to the person between them).

#### Actual Output:
The provided code would not produce the correct output for this case or any other complex case due to the incorrect logic.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
