#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is a list of integers representing the number of test cases, a is a 2D list of integers where each sublist contains n integers representing the a_i values for each test case, b is a 2D list of integers where each sublist contains n integers representing the b_i values for each test case, n is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of people in the queue for each test case, and m is a list of integers where each integer represents the maximum allowable final position of Kirill for each test case. It is guaranteed that the length of pergunta, a, b, n, and m are the same, and for each test case, 1 <= m <= n <= 200,000, 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: `pergunta` is the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]` for all `i < m` after all iterations. `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n - 1` to `0`. `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum of its original value and the sum of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`, and `x` is the sum of `min(a[i], b[i])` for all `i` from `n - 1` to `0`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by lists `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates a value `x` as the sum of the minimums of corresponding elements in `a` and `b` from the end to the beginning. It then updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its original value and `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`. The function prints the final value of `pergunta` for each test case.
