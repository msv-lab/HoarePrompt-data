The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from `n - 1` and decrements by 1 each time until it reaches `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` remains unchanged, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.

Given that `i` remains unchanged at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be one less than its current value for the next iteration.

State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. `i` is decremented by 1.**

To be more specific:
- `i` was `n - 1` at the start of the last iteration.
- After the last iteration, `i` remains `n - 1` (as per the given information).
- For the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 2`.

So, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is updated to `x + min(a[i], b[i])`. `i` is `n - 2`.**
