Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is flawed, and the function does not properly calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in line.

Here are some key issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Costs**: The program does not account for the correct sequence of swaps and the associated costs. It incorrectly sums up the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all positions, which does not reflect the actual cost of moving Kirill to the desired position.

2. **Incorrect Use of `pergunta`**: The variable `pergunta` is initialized to infinity and is supposed to track the minimum cost. However, it is not updated correctly within the loop, and the logic to determine the minimum cost is incorrect.

3. **Ignoring `b_i` Costs for Intermediate Swaps**: The program does not correctly account for the `b_i` costs that Kirill has to pay to the people between `j` and `i` when swapping positions.

To fix the program, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a priority queue or dynamic programming to track the minimum cost of moving Kirill to each position in the queue.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

numCasos = int(input())
for _ in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Priority queue to store (cost, position)
    pq = [(0, n)]  # Start with Kirill at position n with cost 0
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    min_cost = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    min_cost[n] = 0
    
    while pq:
        cost, pos = heapq.heappop(pq)
        if visited[pos]:
            continue
        visited[pos] = True
        
        if pos <= m:
            print(cost)
            break
        
        # Try to swap with each person before pos
        for i in range(pos - 1, -1, -1):
            new_cost = cost + a[i] + sum(b[j] for j in range(i + 1, pos))
            if new_cost < min_cost[i]:
                min_cost[i] = new_cost
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, i))
```

This corrected version uses a priority queue to efficiently find the minimum cost path for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue.
