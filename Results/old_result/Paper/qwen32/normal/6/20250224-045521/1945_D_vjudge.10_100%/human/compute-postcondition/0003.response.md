Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`; `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer must be at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, and `i` is less than `m`.**

Explanation: The value of `pergunta` is now the smaller of its original value and the value of `x + a[i]`. All other variables retain their original values.
