You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis

Kirill wants to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue with the minimum cost. He can bribe people in front of him, paying `a[i]` coins to swap places with the person at position `i`, and `b[k]` coins to each person between `i` and his current position.

### Program Analysis

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that is supposed to compute the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend. Let's break down the program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, representing the minimum cost found so far.
   - `x` is initialized to `0`, representing the accumulated cost.

2. **Loop through the queue in reverse**:
   - The loop iterates from the last person in the queue to the first (`for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`).
   - If `i < m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and the cost of bribing the person at position `i` plus the accumulated cost `x` (`pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])`).
   - The accumulated cost `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` (`x += min(a[i], b[i])`).

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for calculating `x`**:
   - The logic for `x` is incorrect. The accumulated cost `x` should represent the cost of bribing all people between Kirill's current position and the position `j` he wants to move to. The current logic adds `min(a[i], b[i])` to `x` in each iteration, which is not the correct way to calculate the accumulated cost of bribing people between positions.

2. **Handling of `b[i]`**:
   - The program only adds `min(a[i], b[i])` to `x`, but it should add `a[i]` if Kirill moves to position `i` and `b[k]` for all `k` between `i` and his current position.

3. **Incorrect use of `pergunta`**:
   - The variable `pergunta` is used to store the minimum cost, but the way it is updated is incorrect. The cost should be recalculated considering all possible positions Kirill can move to.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the logic for calculating the accumulated cost and updating the minimum cost, the provided program is incorrect. It does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.

Correctness: **False**
