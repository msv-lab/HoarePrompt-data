Postcondition: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`. `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, and `x` is 0. If `i` is less than `m`, `pergunta` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `pergunta` remains unchanged.**
