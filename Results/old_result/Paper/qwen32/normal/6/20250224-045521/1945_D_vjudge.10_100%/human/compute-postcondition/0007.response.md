Output State: **`pergunta` is the minimum of the original `pergunta` and `x + a[i]`, `a` is a 2D list of integers, `b` is a 2D list of integers, `n` is a list of integers where each integer is at least 1, `m` is a list of integers, `x` is `x + min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is `i + 1` (if `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n-1`)**

In simpler terms, the value of `pergunta` has been updated to be the minimum of its original value and the sum of `x` and `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
