Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each of the t test cases, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9; n is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    elif a < b and b > c:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, and `n` is greater than 0. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. Otherwise, the condition `a < b < c` is false. If `a < b` and `b > c`, the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this condition. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b and b > c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 4. The condition `a < b < c` is true if the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this inequality, otherwise it is false. The condition `a < b and b > c` is true if the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this inequality, otherwise it is false. If `a < b < c` is true, then no additional changes are made to `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`. If `a < b < c` is false and `a < b and b > c` is true, then no additional changes are made to `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, or `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, `n` is greater than 5, and `i` is 5. If `a < b < c`, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
