You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then prints "STAIR" if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`, prints "PEAK" if `a` is less than `b` and `b` is greater than `c`, and prints "NONE" for all other cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `n`.
2. It then iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
4. It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the first condition is not met, it checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If true, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description for determining if the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all possible cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
