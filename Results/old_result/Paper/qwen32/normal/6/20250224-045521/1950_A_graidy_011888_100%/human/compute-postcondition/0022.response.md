The print statement `print('PEAK')` in the given code snippet is a straightforward print statement that outputs the string 'PEAK'. The variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the print statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of this particular print statement.

Here's the breakdown:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers between 0 and 9.
- `n` is greater than 5.
- `i` is set to 5.

Since the print statement does not reference any of these variables, the output is simply the string 'PEAK'.

Output: **PEAK**
