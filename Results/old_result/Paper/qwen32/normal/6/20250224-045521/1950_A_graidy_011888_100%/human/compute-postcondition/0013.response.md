The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of these variables is overridden by the new values read from the input. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers read from input such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 4. The condition `a < b < c` is true if the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this inequality, otherwise it is false. The condition `a < b and b > c` is true if the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` satisfy this inequality, otherwise it is false.**
