Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least one tuple, `bullets_used` is `health`, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is `False`. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains `True`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least two tuples, `bullets_used` is `2 * health`, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health` (which is `3 * health`), `can_survive` is `True` if `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, otherwise `False`, `pos` and `health` are the values of the second tuple in the `monsters` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least two tuples, `bullets_used` is `2 * health_next + health`, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `3 * health_next`, `pos` is `pos_next`, `health` is `health_next`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
