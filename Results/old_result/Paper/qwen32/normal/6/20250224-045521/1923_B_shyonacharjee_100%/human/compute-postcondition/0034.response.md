The code snippet provided reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, `can_survive`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])`; `bullets_used` is the sum of the health of all monsters processed before the loop breaks (or all monsters if the loop does not break); `can_survive` is `False` if at any point `total_bullets_needed` exceeds `distance * k` for any monster, otherwise `True`.**
