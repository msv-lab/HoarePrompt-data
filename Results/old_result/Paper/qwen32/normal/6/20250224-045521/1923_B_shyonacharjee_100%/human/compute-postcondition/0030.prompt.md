Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i]); `bullets_used` is 0; `can_survive` is True.
Code of the loop:
for pos, health in monsters:
    distance = abs(pos)
    total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
    if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
        can_survive = False
        break
    bullets_used += health


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])` and must have at least one tuple `(pos, health)`; `bullets_used` is `health`; `can_survive` is False if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, otherwise `can_survive` remains True; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers of length `n` read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples `(x[i], a[i])` sorted by `abs(x[i])` and must have at least one tuple `(pos, health)`; `bullets_used` is `health + health`; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`; `pos` and `health` are the values of the next tuple in `monsters`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to False and the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `pos` and `health` are the values of the next tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `bullets_used` is increased by `health`; `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of the updated `bullets_used` and `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
