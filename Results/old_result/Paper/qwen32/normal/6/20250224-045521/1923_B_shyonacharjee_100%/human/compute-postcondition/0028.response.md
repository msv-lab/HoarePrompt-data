Postcondition: **`pos` and `health` are the values of the next tuple in `monsters`; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.**
