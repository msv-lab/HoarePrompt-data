You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, a list `a` of integers representing monster health, and a list `x` of integers representing monster positions. For each test case, it determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters using bullets, where the number of bullets needed for each monster is equal to its health, and the total number of bullets used cannot exceed `k` times the distance to the monster. The function outputs 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated under these conditions, otherwise 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to determine whether it is possible to kill all monsters before they reach the character at position 0. The logic is as follows:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets `k` that can be fired per second. It also reads the health of each monster and their respective positions.

2. **Sorting Monsters**: The monsters are sorted based on their distance from the character (position 0). This is done using the `sorted()` function with a key that computes the absolute value of the position.

3. **Simulation of the Battle**:
   - The program initializes `bullets_used` to 0 and `can_survive` to True.
   - It then iterates over each monster in the sorted list.
   - For each monster, it calculates the distance from the character and the total number of bullets needed to kill that monster.
   - If the total number of bullets needed to kill the current monster plus the bullets already used exceeds the maximum number of bullets that can be fired before the monster reaches the character (`distance * k`), it sets `can_survive` to False and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the monster can be killed before it reaches the character, the program adds the health of the monster to `bullets_used`.

4. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints 'YES' if it is possible to kill all monsters before they reach the character, otherwise 'NO'.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The program only checks if the total bullets needed to kill the current monster (considering the bullets already used) can be fired before it reaches the character. It does not account for the fact that the monsters that are closer to the character are moving faster and may reach the character before the bullets for the current monster can be fired. 

The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated simulation where the program keeps track of the exact time each monster needs to be killed and whether the required number of bullets can be fired at that time, considering the bullets available per second.

Given the above reasoning, the program is not correct for all cases.
