Output State: **`t` remains unchanged, `n` and `k` are integers read from the input, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple and must have at least two tuples, `bullets_used` is `health`, `distance` is `abs(pos)`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `pos` and `health` are the values of the second tuple in the `monsters` list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
