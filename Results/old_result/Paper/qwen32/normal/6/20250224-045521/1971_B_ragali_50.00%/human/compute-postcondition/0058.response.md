The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is being iterated over the string `s`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next character in the string `s`.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string and `i` is currently the first character of `s`, the next iteration will set `i` to the second character of `s`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces, `a` is a set containing the first character of `s`, `i` is the second character of `s`**
