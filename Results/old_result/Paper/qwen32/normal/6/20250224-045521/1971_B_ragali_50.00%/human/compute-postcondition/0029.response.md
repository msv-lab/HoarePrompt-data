The code snippet `a = set()` reassigns `a` to be an empty set, discarding its previous value, which was a set containing all unique characters from the string `s`. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces, `a` is an empty set, `i` is incremented by 1.**
