Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet step-by-step:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
  - `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters with no leading or trailing spaces.
  - `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`.
  - `i` is the last character of `s`.
  - The length of `a` is 1, indicating that all characters in `s` are the same.

- **Python Code Snippet:**
  ```python
  print('NO')
  ```

The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables `t`, `s`, `a`, or `i`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is:

Output: **NO**
