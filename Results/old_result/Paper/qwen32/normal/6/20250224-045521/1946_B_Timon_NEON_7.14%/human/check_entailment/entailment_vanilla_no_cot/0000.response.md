Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `func_3` is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, but it currently has no implementation and always returns `0`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Maximum Subarray Sum**: The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum subarray sum, but its logic is flawed. It does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when all elements are negative. Also, it does not return the sum of the maximum subarray, only the indices.

3. **Modulo Operation**: While `func_1` correctly computes the modulo operation, it is not used in the context of the problem. The modulo operation should be applied to the final result after all operations.

4. **Main Logic Missing**: There is no main logic that ties these functions together to solve the problem. Specifically, there is no loop or logic to perform the `k` operations and update the array accordingly.

To solve the problem correctly, one should:

- Calculate the maximum subarray sum using an algorithm like Kadane's.
- Use this maximum subarray sum to perform the operations, as inserting this sum repeatedly will maximize the overall sum.
- Apply the modulo operation to the final result to ensure it fits within the required constraints.

Here is a simplified version of the correct approach:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
    for x in arr:
        max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far

def max_possible_sum(n, k, arr):
    max_sum = sum(arr)
    if max_sum <= 0:
        return max_sum % MOD
    max_subarray = max_subarray_sum(arr)
    return (max_sum + max_subarray * k) % MOD

def solve():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input[index])
        k = int(input[index + 1])
        index += 2
        arr = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(max_possible_sum(n, k, arr))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# solve()
```

This code correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations by leveraging the maximum subarray sum and applying it repeatedly. It also handles the modulo operation correctly.
