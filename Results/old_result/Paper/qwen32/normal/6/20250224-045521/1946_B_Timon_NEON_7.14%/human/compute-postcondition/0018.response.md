Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `new_segment` is either `[]` or a non-empty list where the first element has been increased by `arr[i]`, `max_segment` is either `[0, 0]` or `[arr[i], 0]`, `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1]]` or an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 0. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated based on the comparison with `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated accordingly. If `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is updated by adding `arr[i]` to its first element and `max_segment` is set to `[arr[i], 0]`.**
