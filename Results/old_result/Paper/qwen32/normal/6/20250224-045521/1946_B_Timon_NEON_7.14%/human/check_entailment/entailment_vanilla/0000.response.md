Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray, calculating its sum, and inserting that sum anywhere in the array. The final sum should be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Program Analysis:

#### Function 1: `func_1(number)`
- This function simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- This function is correct and serves the purpose of applying the modulo operation.

#### Function 2: `func_2(arr)`
- This function is intended to find the maximum sum contiguous subarray in the array `arr`.
- However, the implementation is incorrect. The function seems to be trying to track segments and their sums, but the logic is flawed. For example, it does not correctly handle negative numbers and the way it appends segments to `segments_variants` is incorrect. It also does not ensure that the maximum segment is correctly identified.
- A correct implementation would use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray efficiently.

#### Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`
- This function is incomplete. It is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `quantity` operations, but it does nothing and returns 0.
- The logic for performing the operations and calculating the maximum sum is missing.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because:
1. `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum contiguous subarray.
2. `func_3` is incomplete and does not implement the required logic to perform the operations and calculate the maximum sum.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
