### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and the main logic in the loop correctly implement the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
    - This function takes an integer `number` and returns `number % 1000000007`.
    - This is correctly implemented as per the problem statement, which requires the answer to be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
    - This function is supposed to find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum in the given array `arr`.
    - The logic in the function seems to be an attempt at a modified version of Kadane's algorithm, but it has some issues:
        - The `max_segment` and `new_segment` are not correctly managed. Specifically, `max_segment` should be updated correctly when a new maximum is found.
        - The `segments_variants` list is supposed to hold segments that end with a negative number, but it is not being used effectively.
        - The final check for `total_max_segment` is not correctly implemented. It should ensure that the segment with the maximum sum is selected properly.
    - The function should correctly return the maximum sum segment, but the current implementation does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when there are no positive numbers in the array.

3. **Main Logic**:
    - The main logic calculates the `max_segment` using `func_2`.
    - It then calculates the `answer` using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
    - This formula assumes that the maximum sum segment can be repeatedly added to maximize the array sum, which is a valid strategy if the maximum sum segment is positive.
    - If `max_segment[0]` is `-1` (indicating no positive segment was found), it sets `max_segment[0]` to `0`.
    - The `answer` is then passed to `func_1` to get the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues:
- `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum sum segment in all cases, particularly when there are no positive numbers in the array.
- The main logic assumes that `func_2` always returns a valid segment, but `func_2` may return `[-1]` which is not handled correctly in the calculation of `answer`.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct due to the issues in `func_2` and the assumption that `func_2` always returns a valid segment.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
