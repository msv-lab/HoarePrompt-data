The given code snippet initializes `new_segment` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `arr`, `max_sum`, `i`, `max_segment`, or `segments_variants`. Therefore, the only change is that `new_segment` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment` if `new_segment[0]` is greater than `max_segment[0]` otherwise `segments_variants` includes `new_segment + [1]` and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.**
