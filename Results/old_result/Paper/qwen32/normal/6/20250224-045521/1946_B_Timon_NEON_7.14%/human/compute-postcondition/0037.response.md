Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated based on the comparison with `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated accordingly. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1]]` or an empty list, `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 1. After the if statement, if `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is updated to `[arr[1], 1]`. If `arr[i]` is less than 0, no changes are made to `new_segment`.

```
max_segment[0] += arr[i]
```

Now, let's determine the output state after the code execution.

- If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is initialized to `[arr[0], 0]`.
- `i` is 1, so `max_segment[0]` is updated to `max_segment[0] + arr[1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`, otherwise `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is `[arr[0] + arr[1], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `max_segment` remains unchanged; `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1]]` or an empty list; `max_sum` is -1; `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms, if the first element of `arr` is non-negative, `max_segment`'s first element is now the sum of the first and second elements of `arr`. All other variables remain as they were, except `max_segment` as described.
