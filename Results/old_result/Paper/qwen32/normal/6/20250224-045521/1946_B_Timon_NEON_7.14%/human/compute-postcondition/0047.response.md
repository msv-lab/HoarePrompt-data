The code snippet `new_segment[0] += arr[i]` increments the value of `new_segment[0]` by the value of `arr[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `arr[i]` is `arr[2]`. Therefore, `new_segment[0]` is updated to its current value plus `arr[2]`.

The other variables (`arr`, `max_sum`, `i`, `max_segment[0]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2, `max_segment[0]` is `max_segment[0] + arr[2]`, `new_segment[0]` is updated to `new_segment[0] + arr[2]`.**
