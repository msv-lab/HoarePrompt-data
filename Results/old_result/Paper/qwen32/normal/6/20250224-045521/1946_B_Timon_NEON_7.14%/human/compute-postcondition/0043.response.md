Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `max_sum` is -1, `i` is 2. If `max_segment[0]` is greater than `new_segment[0]`, `segments_variants` includes `max_segment` with `1` appended to it. Otherwise, `segments_variants` includes a new list which is `new_segment + [1]`, and `max_segment` is updated to `new_segment`.**
