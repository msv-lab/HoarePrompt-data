The code snippet `max_segment = new_segment` assigns the value of `new_segment` to `max_segment`. 

Given the initial state, `new_segment` is either `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or it remains an empty list if `arr[0]` is less than 0. Since `max_segment` is set to `new_segment`, `max_segment` will also be `[arr[0], 0]` if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, or it will be an empty list if `arr[0]` is less than 0.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer; if `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]` and `max_segment` is `[arr[0], 0]`; otherwise, `new_segment` is an empty list and `max_segment` is an empty list; `max_sum` is -1; `i` is 1; `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1], [arr[0], 0, 0]]` or `[[arr[0], 0, 0]]` depending on the initial state of `segments_variants`.**
