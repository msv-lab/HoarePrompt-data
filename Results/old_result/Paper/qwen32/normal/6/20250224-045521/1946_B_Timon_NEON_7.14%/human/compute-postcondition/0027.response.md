Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `new_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. Otherwise, `new_segment` remains an empty list. If `arr[0]` is less than 0, `max_segment` is updated based on the comparison with `new_segment` and `segments_variants` is updated accordingly. If `arr[0]` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_segment` is set to `[arr[0], 0]`. `segments_variants` is either `[[0, 0, -1], [arr[0], 0, 0]]` or `[[arr[0], 0, 0]]` depending on the initial state of `segments_variants`. `max_sum` is -1, and `i` is 1.**

In simpler terms: The `segments_variants` list now includes an additional segment, which is `new_segment` with an appended index `i - 1`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
