### Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the given problem by calculating the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after a series of moves. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and correctness:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (size of the chessboard) and `k` (number of moves already played).
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers representing the moves.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a != b`.
     - If `a != b`, it means the move and its mirrored counterpart occupy two distinct positions, so `n` is decremented by 2.
     - If `a == b`, it means the move occupies a single position, so `n` is decremented by 1.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming.
   - It initializes a list `dp` with the base cases `[1, 1]`.
   - It iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the list `dp` with the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - It maintains only the last two elements in `dp` by popping the first element after each update.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of `dp`, which represents the number of configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Analysis of the Dynamic Programming Formula:
The formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (10^9 + 7)` is used to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining `i` positions on the chessboard. This formula is derived from combinatorial principles, where each new position can either be left empty or occupied by a rook, and the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions is calculated based on the previous states.

### Checking the Output:
The program correctly handles the input parsing and move processing, and the dynamic programming function `func_1` is correctly implemented to compute the number of configurations. The provided example inputs and outputs match the expected results based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
