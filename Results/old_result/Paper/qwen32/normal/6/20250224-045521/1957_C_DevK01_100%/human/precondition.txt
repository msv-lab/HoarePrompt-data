n is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, k, moves) representing the size of the chessboard, the number of moves already played, and a list of k moves respectively. Each move is a tuple (r_i, c_i) representing the coordinates of the i-th move made, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
