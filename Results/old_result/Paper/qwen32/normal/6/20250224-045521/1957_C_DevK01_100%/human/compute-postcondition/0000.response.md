Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= n. Each of the next k lines contains two integers r_i and c_i, representing the i-th move, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. `dp` is a list with the values [1, 1].**

Natural Language: The initial conditions for the test cases remain unchanged. The variable `dp` is now a list containing two integers, both with the value 1.
