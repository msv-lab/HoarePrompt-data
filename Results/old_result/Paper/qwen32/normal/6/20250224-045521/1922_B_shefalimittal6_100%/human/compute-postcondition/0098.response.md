The code snippet `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Given that the initial state specifies `idx` is `2n + 5`, after the increment, `idx` becomes `2n + 6`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `data[1]` is a string representing an integer value of at least 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings with at least `n + 4` elements where `data[n + 3]` is a string representation of a positive integer, `idx` is `2n + 6`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and the string representation of `ans` again, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` being 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the accumulated sum from all iterations of the loop, `n` is a positive integer and is now `n + 1`, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2n + 5]`.**
