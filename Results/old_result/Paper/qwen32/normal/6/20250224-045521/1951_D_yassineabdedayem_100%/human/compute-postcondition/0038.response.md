The given Python code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`, but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, their values do not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`.
   - `n` and `k` are integers with the constraint \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0.

2. The code snippet provided is:
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `n`, `k`, or `t`, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
