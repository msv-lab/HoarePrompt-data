Functionality: **The function reads multiple pairs of positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, and for each pair, it determines whether it is possible to partition `n` into `k` parts under specific conditions. If it is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of parts and their sizes; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
