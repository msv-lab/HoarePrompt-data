The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `k`, and `t`), but these variables are not used in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the value of `n`, `k`, and `t` does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\) and that `n` equals `k`.
2. The variable `t` is also an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
3. The code snippet provided is `print(1)`, which directly prints the integer `1` to the console.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `n`, `k`, or `t`, their values do not influence the output.

Output: **1**
