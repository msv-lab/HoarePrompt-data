Output State: **After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n` and `k` will be the last pair of integers read from the input. The program will have printed the appropriate output for each pair of `n` and `k` as per the given conditions.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has gone through all `t` iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0, and `n` and `k` will hold the values of the last pair of integers that were read. The program will have printed whether each pair of `n` and `k` met the conditions specified in the loop, but the final state of `n` and `k` will reflect the last pair processed.
