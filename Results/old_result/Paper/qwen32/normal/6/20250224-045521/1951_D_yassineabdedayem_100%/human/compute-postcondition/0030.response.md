The code snippet provided reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. The variable `t` is mentioned in the initial state but is not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated to the integers read from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0.**
