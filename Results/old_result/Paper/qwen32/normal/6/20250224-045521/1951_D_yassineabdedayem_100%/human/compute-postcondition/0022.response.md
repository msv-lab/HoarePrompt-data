Given the initial state and the Python code snippet provided, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `t` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `n`, `k`, or `t`.
   - Regardless of the values of `n` and `k`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold, but this condition does not affect the `print` statement.
   - The code snippet will always output the string `'YES'`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **YES**
