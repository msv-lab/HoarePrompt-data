The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common placeholder indicating that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Since the loop variable `_` does not affect the loop's continuation, the state of `n`, `k`, and `t` does not need to be adjusted based on the loop variable.

However, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must be decremented by 1, as the loop iterates `t` times. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop's control condition.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1. If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold without any changes to `n` and `k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 1 and is decremented by 1. If `n` equals `k`, no additional changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` either holds or does not hold without any changes to `n` and `k`.**

Simplified State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than or equal to 1.**

State: **`n` and `k` are the two integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 0.**
