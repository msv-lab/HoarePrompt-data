The `print('YES')` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, or `t` as long as the initial conditions are met. The conditions provided are constraints on the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`, but they do not affect the content of the string being printed.

Here's the breakdown:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18} and `n` is not equal to `k`.
- `t` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1.
- The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` must also be satisfied.

None of these conditions influence the `print('YES')` statement directly; it simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
