To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State Recap:
- `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\).
- `n` is not equal to `k`.
- The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` must be satisfied.
- `t` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 1 (though `t` is not used in the provided print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - k + 1, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement outputs the value of the expression `n - k + 1`.
- The `end=' '` argument ensures that after printing the value, a space is added instead of a newline.

### Determining the Output:
- The value to be printed is `n - k + 1`.
- Since `n` and `k` are integers, `n - k + 1` will also be an integer.
- The specific numerical value cannot be determined without knowing the exact values of `n` and `k`, but we know the expression to be evaluated.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the value of `n - k + 1` followed by a space.

Output: **n - k + 1 (where n and k are integers satisfying the given conditions)**
