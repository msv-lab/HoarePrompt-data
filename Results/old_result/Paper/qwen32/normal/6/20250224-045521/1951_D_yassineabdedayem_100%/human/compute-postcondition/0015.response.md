Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are integers read from the input such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18}; `t` is an integer and is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`. If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the condition `n + 2 > k * 2` holds. Otherwise, the condition `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`.**
