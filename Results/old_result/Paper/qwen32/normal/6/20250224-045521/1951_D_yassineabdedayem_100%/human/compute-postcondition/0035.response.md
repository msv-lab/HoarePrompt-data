The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `k`, `t`), but none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `k`, and `t`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement directly outputs the integer `2`.

Given this information, the output of the `print` statement is simply the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
