The provided initial state describes the variables `n`, `k`, and `t` which are integers read from the input. However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since there are no references to `n`, `k`, or `t` in the print statement, the values of these variables do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
