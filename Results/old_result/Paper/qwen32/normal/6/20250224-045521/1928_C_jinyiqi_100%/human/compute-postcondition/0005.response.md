The code appends the result of `int(x / i)` to the list `output2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 1 and divisible by `i`, and `output1` contains the element 1. Since `i` is 1, `int(x / i)` will simply be `x` because any number divided by 1 is the number itself. Thus, `x` is appended to `output2`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is at least 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`; `output1` contains the element 1; `output2` contains the element `x`.**
