Reasoning: The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed for it to be correct based on the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined. It should take two arguments, `n` and `x`, but it only takes `x`. The correct definition should be `def func_1(x):` or `def func_1(n, x):` depending on the intended logic, but based on the context, it seems to be intended to find divisors of a number.

2. **Logic for Finding Divisors**: The function `func_1` is supposed to find divisors of a number `x` and return them in a specific order. However, the current implementation does not account for the logic needed to determine valid `k` values based on the problem's constraints.

3. **Handling of `k` Values**: The program checks for conditions related to `k` but does not correctly implement the logic to determine the valid `k` values. Specifically, the conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` do not directly relate to the problem's requirements for valid `k` values.

4. **Output Calculation**: The program calculates potential `k` values and checks if they meet certain conditions, but the logic for these conditions is flawed and does not correctly determine the valid `k` values.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
