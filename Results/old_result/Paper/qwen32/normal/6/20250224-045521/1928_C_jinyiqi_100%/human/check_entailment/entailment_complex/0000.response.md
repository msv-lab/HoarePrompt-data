Reasoning:  
The provided program is attempting to solve the problem by calculating the possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints. However, there are several issues in the program that lead to incorrect results.

1. **Incorrect Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined. The problem description suggests that the function should take two parameters, `n` and `x`, but the provided function `func_1` only takes one parameter, `x`. This function is supposed to find the divisors of a number, but the way it is used in the code, it is not clear how it relates to the problem of finding the possible values of `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding `k`**: The logic for finding the possible values of `k` is flawed. The code checks if `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` and then attempts to find divisors of these values. However, the way these conditions are used and the way the divisors are interpreted do not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling of Divisors**: The function `func_1` returns divisors in a specific order, but the code does not correctly interpret these divisors to find valid `k` values. The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x` is used to filter these divisors, but this logic does not correctly map to the problem's requirements for finding `k`.

4. **Output Handling**: The code uses a set to remove duplicates from the list of possible `k` values, but the logic for finding these values is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
