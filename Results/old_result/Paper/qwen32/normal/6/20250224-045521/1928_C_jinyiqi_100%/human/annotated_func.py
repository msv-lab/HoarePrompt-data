#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, x):` where `n` and `x` are integers such that `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.
def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
        
    #State: output1 = [1, 2, 3], output2 = [12, 6, 4]
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns [12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `x` and returns a list of integers consisting of the divisors of `x` in descending order, followed by the divisors in ascending order.
