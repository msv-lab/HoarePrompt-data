The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. The loop will proceed to the next iteration if `i` is incremented and remains less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The value of `x` should remain the same, as long as it is at least 1 and divisible by the new `i` (which is 2).

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is at least 4 (since x must be divisible by 2), `output1` contains the element 1, and `output2` contains the element `x`**.
