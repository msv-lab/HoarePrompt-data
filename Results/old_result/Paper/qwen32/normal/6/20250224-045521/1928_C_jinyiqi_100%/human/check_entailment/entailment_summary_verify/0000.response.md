Let's systematically analyze the problem, the provided code, and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires determining the number of possible values of `k` for which Vasya's position `n` and number `x` fit the described settling pattern. The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions and follows a specific sequence.

### Code Analysis

The provided code attempts to solve the problem by:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading `n` and `x`.
3. Using the function `func_1` to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`.
4. Checking conditions to determine valid `k` values.
5. Printing the number of valid `k` values.

### Function Summary

The function `func_1(x)` returns a list of divisors of `x` in descending order, followed by the divisors in ascending order.

### Issues Identified

1. **Undefined Function `func_1`**:
   The function `func_1` is used but not defined in the provided code. This will cause a `NameError` when executed.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `k`**:
   The logic for determining valid `k` values is flawed. The program checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`, but this does not correctly map to the problem's requirements for `k`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, such as when `x` is 1 or when `n` and `x` have specific relationships.

### Detailed Reasoning

Let's break down the logic and check if it aligns with the problem requirements.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Settling Pattern**:
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - Within each segment of length `2k - 2`, the sequence is `1, 2, ..., k, k-1, ..., 2`.

2. **Position and Number Relationship**:
   - For a given position `n` and number `x`, we need to determine if there exists a `k` such that the sequence at position `n` is `x`.

3. **Using Divisors**:
   - The program uses divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` to find potential `k` values.
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is used to filter valid `k` values.

4. **Flaws in the Logic**:
   - The use of divisors and the specific condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` does not directly map to the problem's requirements.
   - The program does not correctly account for the repeating pattern and the specific position within the pattern.

### Conclusion

Given the undefined function `func_1` and the flawed logic for determining valid `k` values, the program is incorrect. The original assessment is accurate in identifying these issues.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
