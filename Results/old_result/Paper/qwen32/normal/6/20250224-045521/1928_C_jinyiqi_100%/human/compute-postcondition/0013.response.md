The code appends the integer value of `x / i` to the list `output2`. Given that `i` is 3 and `x` is at least 4, the value `x / i` is at least `4 / 3`, which is approximately `1.333`. When converted to an integer, this value becomes `1`. Therefore, `1` is appended to `output2`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is at least 4, `output1` contains the elements 1 and 3, `output2` contains the element 1.**
