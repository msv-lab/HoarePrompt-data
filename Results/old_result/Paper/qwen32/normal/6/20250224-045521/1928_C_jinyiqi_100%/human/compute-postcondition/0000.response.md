The provided code snippet only initializes an empty list named `output1`. No other variables are affected, and the function `func_1` remains incorrectly defined as per the initial state description. 

Output State: **The function `func_1` is incorrectly defined based on the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, x):` where `n` and `x` are integers such that `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`. `output1` is an empty list.**
