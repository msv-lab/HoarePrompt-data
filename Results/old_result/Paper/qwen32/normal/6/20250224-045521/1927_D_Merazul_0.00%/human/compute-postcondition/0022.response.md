The code snippet `u = i in a` updates the value of `u` based on whether `i` (which is `t + 2`) is in the set `a`. The other variables remain unchanged unless they are directly affected by this line of code. 

Given that `i` is `t + 2`, `u` will be `True` if `t + 2` is an element of the set `a`; otherwise, `u` will be `False`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t <= 10^4, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a set containing unique elements from the list returned by `R()`, `b` is a set containing unique elements from the list returned by `R()`, `f` is `f & (u | v)`, `m` is adjusted by subtracting `u & ~v` from its initial value, `n` is `k // 2` if `u` is `True` or `v` is `False`; otherwise, `n` is `k // 2 - 1`, decremented by 1 if `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`, `u` is `True` if `t + 2` is in `a`; otherwise, `u` is `False`, `v` is a boolean value indicating whether `t + 2` is in `b`, `i` is `t + 2`**
