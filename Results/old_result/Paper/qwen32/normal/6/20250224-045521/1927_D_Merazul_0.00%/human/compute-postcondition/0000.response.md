Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `R` is a lambda function that maps input to a list of integers; `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, and `r` are not yet defined.**

Explanation: The lambda function `R` is defined to map input to a list of integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `l`, and `r` are part of the initial state or will be defined later in the code, but they are not affected by the given line.
