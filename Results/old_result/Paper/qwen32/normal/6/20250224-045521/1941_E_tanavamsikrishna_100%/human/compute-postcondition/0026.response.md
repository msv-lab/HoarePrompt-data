The provided code snippet is just `pass`, which does nothing and does not affect any variables or the state of the program.

Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`, `min_heap` must have an element `(x, y)` where `y <= -1`, `d` must be less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 1`**.
