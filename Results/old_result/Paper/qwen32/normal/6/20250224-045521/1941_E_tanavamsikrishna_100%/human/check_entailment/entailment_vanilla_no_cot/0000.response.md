Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row, but it does not correctly implement the logic for placing supports with the constraints given (specifically, the constraint that supports must be no more than `d` apart).

The logic in `func_1` does not account for the requirement to place supports such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. The current implementation just adds costs without ensuring this constraint, which can lead to incorrect results.

To correctly solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated method to ensure the constraints are met should be used. The current implementation might work for some cases by chance, but it does not guarantee the correct solution for all valid inputs as per the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
