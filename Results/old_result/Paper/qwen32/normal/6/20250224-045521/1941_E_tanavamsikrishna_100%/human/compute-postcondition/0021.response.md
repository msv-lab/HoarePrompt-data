To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `len(row)`. The loop condition is `for i in range(d, len(row))`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(row)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `row[0]` is 1
- `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`
- `min_heap` is `[e, (row[i], i)]`
- `d` must be less than `len(row)`

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop variable `i` would have taken on the value `d` and then incremented to `d + 1` for the next iteration.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` should be `d + 1`
- `len(row)` remains the same

The state of other variables like `row`, `min_heap`, and `d` do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` for `i` from 1 to `d-1` is `e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 1`, `min_heap` is `[e, (row[i], i)]`, `d` must be less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 1`**
