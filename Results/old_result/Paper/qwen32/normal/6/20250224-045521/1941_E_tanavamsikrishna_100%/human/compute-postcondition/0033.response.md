The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `d`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `d`. If `i` is less than `len(row)`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `d + 1`, and `d` is less than `len(row)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`row[0]` is 1, `row[i]` is `2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2`, `min_heap` contains elements where the second value is greater than `i - (d + 2)` including the new element `(2*e[0] + row[i] (before the update) + 2, d + 1)`, `d` is less than `len(row)`, `i` is `d + 2`**
