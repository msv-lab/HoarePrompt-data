The function reads input values for the number of rows (`n`), number of columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`). It then calculates costs for each row based on a function `func_1` and computes the total costs for all possible configurations of `k` consecutive rows. Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among these configurations.
