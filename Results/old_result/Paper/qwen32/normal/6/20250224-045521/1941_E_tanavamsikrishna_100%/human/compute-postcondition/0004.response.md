To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head. The loop head is defined by the `for` loop statement:

```python
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `(len(costs) - (k - 1))` is greater than 0. This means that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` should be a positive integer.

Let's break down the components:

- `len(costs)`: This is the length of the `costs` list, which is `n` because `costs` is a list of `n` elements.
- `k - 1`: Given that `1 <= k <= n`, the value of `k - 1` will be in the range `[0, n-1]`.

For the loop to execute, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0:
\[ n - (k - 1) > 0 \]
\[ n - k + 1 > 0 \]
\[ n > k - 1 \]

Given that `1 <= k <= n`, `n > k - 1` is always true. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `costs` has `n` elements and `k` is within the specified range.

However, the state before the loop starts already specifies that `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, and `costs` is a list of `n` elements. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is an empty list**
