The provided code snippet initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. No other variables are affected by this code. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a 2D list containing `n` rows, each with `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding row in `rows` and the integer `d`, `total_costs` is an empty list.**
