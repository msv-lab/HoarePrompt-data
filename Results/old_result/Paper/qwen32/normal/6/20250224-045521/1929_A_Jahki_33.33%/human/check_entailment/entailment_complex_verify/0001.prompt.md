You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

    2 1

Output

    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. num2 is not used in the problem description and should be ignored.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `order` is the count of times `a[i - 1] >= a[i]` is true for `i` from 1 to `n - 1`.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of `n` integers and an unused parameter `num2`. It returns `True` if the list `a` is strictly increasing (i.e., each element is less than the next one), and `False` otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks us to find the maximum beauty of an array. The beauty is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after arranging the array in any way. The goal is to maximize this sum.

### Key Idea:
To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array in increasing order. This way, each difference `(a_i - a_{i-1})` will be non-negative and maximized given the sorted order.

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Sort the Array**: By sorting the array in increasing order, we ensure that each difference `(a_i - a_{i-1})` is as large as possible.
2. **Calculate Beauty**: Compute the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array using `sorted(a)`.
3. **Beauty Calculation**: It calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program includes a function `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this function is not correctly used in the main logic and seems unnecessary for solving the problem. The program incorrectly prints `0` if the array is already sorted, which is not always correct.

### Issues in the Given Program:
- The function `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrectly used. The beauty should always be calculated as the sum of differences in the sorted array, regardless of the initial order.
- The `func_1` check and its corresponding print statement should be removed or corrected.

### Corrected Logic:
- Always sort the array.
- Calculate the beauty as the sum of differences in the sorted array.
- Print the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrectly used function `func_1`. The beauty should always be calculated for the sorted array.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
