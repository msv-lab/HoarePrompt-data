Reasoning: 
The given program is meant to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. The program sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the beauty based on the sorted array, which is a correct approach to maximize the beauty.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`, and the program incorrectly outputs `0` for that test case. This is not correct because the beauty of a sorted array (in non-decreasing order) is not necessarily `0`. It is only `0` if all elements in the array are the same. 

In the provided code, the line `if func_1(a, num2): print(0)` should be removed or corrected to handle cases where the array is already sorted but not all elements are the same. Since the function `func_1` is not correctly used to determine when the beauty is `0`, the program will give incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
