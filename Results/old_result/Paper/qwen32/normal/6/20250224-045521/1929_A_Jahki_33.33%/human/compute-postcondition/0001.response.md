The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num2`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num2`. If `num2` is greater than 1, the loop will execute because the range function will generate at least one value (starting from 1 up to, but not including, `num2`). 

The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `order` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, `num2` must be greater than 1. The initial value of `i` does not need to be adjusted because the `range` function will set `i` to 1 on the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `order` is 0; `num2` must be greater than 1**
