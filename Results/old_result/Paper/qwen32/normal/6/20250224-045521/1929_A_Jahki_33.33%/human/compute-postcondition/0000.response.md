The code snippet provided only initializes a variable `order` to 0. No other variables are affected or modified. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not referenced or altered in the given code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9; `order` is 0; `num2` is not used in the problem description and should be ignored.**
