### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the function summary.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). To achieve this, the array should be sorted in increasing order because this maximizes each difference \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements.
2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the array using `sorted(a)`.
3. **Beauty Calculation**: It calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing up the differences between consecutive elements.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program includes a function `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If the array is sorted, it prints `0`. This is incorrect because the beauty of a sorted array is not necessarily `0`. The beauty should be calculated as the sum of differences, which can be non-zero even if the array is already sorted.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` checks if the list `a` is strictly increasing. If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

#### Issues in the Given Program:
- The function `func_1` is unnecessary for calculating the maximum beauty. The beauty should always be calculated for the sorted array.
- The check `if func_1(a, num2): print(0)` is incorrect because it assumes that if the array is already sorted, the beauty is `0`. This is not true; the beauty should be calculated as the sum of differences in the sorted array.

#### Corrected Logic:
- Always sort the array.
- Calculate the beauty as the sum of differences in the sorted array.
- Print the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the unnecessary and incorrectly used function `func_1`. The beauty should always be calculated for the sorted array, regardless of its initial order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The function `func_1` is not needed, and the beauty calculation should be done on the sorted array in all cases.
