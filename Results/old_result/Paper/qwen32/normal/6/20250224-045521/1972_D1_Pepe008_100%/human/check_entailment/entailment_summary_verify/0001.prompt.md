You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving `a` and `b`, and then outputs the result minus two.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program and determine if it correctly solves the given problem. The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Condition**:
   The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
   \[
   a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
   \]
   for some integer \(k\).

2. **Simplifying the Condition**:
   Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\). The condition becomes:
   \[
   d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d \implies a' + b' = k \cdot b' \cdot d
   \]
   This implies \(a' + b'\) must be divisible by \(b' \cdot d\).

3. **Iterating Over Possible Values**:
   The program iterates over possible values of \(b\) and calculates the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). However, the logic inside the loop seems incorrect and overly complicated.

4. **Analysis of the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `suma` to 0 and iterates over possible values of \(i\) (which is actually \(b\) in the problem statement).
   - It calculates `x` as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - It checks if `x` is positive and adds it to `suma`.
   - It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) to add an extra 1 to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Issues in the Program

- The formula used to calculate `x` and the conditions to add to `suma` do not correctly reflect the problem's conditions.
- The logic seems to be misguided and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- The subtraction of 2 at the end is arbitrary and not explained by the logic.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as per the described logic and conditions. The logic inside the loop and the way `suma` is calculated and adjusted do not match the problem requirements.
