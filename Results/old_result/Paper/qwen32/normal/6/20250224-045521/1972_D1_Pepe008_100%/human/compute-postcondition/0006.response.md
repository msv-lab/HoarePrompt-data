The code calculates the value of `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. The variables `a` and `i` are used in this calculation, but their specific values are not provided, so `x` will be expressed in terms of `a` and `i`.

The values of `t`, `T`, `info`, `b`, and `suma` are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**
