The code snippet `info = input().split()` takes an input from the user, which is expected to be a string, and then splits this string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. This list is assigned to the variable `info`.

Given the initial state where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 and `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, the value of `t` and `T` remain unchanged. The new variable `info` is introduced, which will hold the list of substrings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `T` is greater than or equal to 1; `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input.**
