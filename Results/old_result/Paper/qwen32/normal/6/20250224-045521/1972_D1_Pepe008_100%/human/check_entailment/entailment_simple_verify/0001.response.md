### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

#### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
\[
a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
\]
for some integer \(k\).

Let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\). The condition becomes:
\[
d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d \implies a' + b' = k \cdot b' \cdot d
\]
This implies \(a' + b'\) must be divisible by \(b' \cdot d\).

#### Program Analysis

The provided program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\). It initializes `suma` to 0 and iterates over possible values of \(i\) (which is actually \(b\) in the problem statement).

The logic inside the loop is as follows:
- It calculates `x` as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
- It checks if `x` is positive and adds it to `suma`.
- It also checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\) to add an extra 1 to `suma`.
- Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

#### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Formula for `x`**: The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not correctly reflect the problem's conditions. It seems to be trying to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `b`, but the formula is not derived from the problem's conditions.

2. **Arbitrary Adjustments**: The program adds an extra 1 to `suma` based on the conditions \((a - i * (i - 1)) \% i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) \% i ** 2 == 0\). These conditions do not logically follow from the problem's requirements.

3. **Subtraction of 2**: The final result is adjusted by subtracting 2, which is not explained by the logic of the program. This arbitrary adjustment suggests that the program's logic is flawed.

#### Correct Approach

A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds. This can be done efficiently by leveraging the properties of the gcd and the constraints.

However, given the provided program, it is clear that it does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Final Answer

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Final: False**
