The code snippet assigns the integer value of the first element of the `info` list to variable `a` and the integer value of the second element of the `info` list to variable `b`. The values of `suma`, `t`, and the condition that `T` must be greater than the new value of `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`suma` is 15, `t` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than the new value of `t`, `info` is a list of strings from the input, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`.**
