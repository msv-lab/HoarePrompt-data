Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `b` remains the same, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `suma + x`**

Natural Language Explanation: The value of `i` is updated to `i + 2`, and `b` remains unchanged. The value of `x` is recalculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The value of `suma` is updated to its current value plus the new value of `x`.
