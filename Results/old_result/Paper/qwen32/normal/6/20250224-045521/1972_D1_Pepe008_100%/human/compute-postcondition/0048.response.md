Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 2 <= t <= 10^4, `T` is greater than or equal to `t`, `info` is a list of substrings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is an integer value of `info[1]` and is at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is increased by `x` and then increased by 1.**

In simple terms, the value of `suma` is increased by 1 after the code snippet is executed. All other variables retain their previous values.
