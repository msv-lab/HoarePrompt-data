You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it meets the problem description for every potential case.

### Analysis
The program is designed to determine the minimum number of 5x3 screens required to place `x` number of 1x1 icons and `y` number of 2x2 icons. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`.
2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is simply `x`.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, representing the total space occupied by 2x2 icons.
3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, representing the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
5. **Determine Extra Screens**:
   - If `space_x` (the space required for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then no additional screens are needed, and `screen_require_for_y` is the answer.
   - Otherwise, the extra space required is `space_x - remaining_cells`. The number of additional screens needed is calculated based on the extra space required.

### Potential Issues
Let's test the program with some edge cases to ensure it works correctly:
1. **No Icons**:
   - Input: `0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.
2. **Only 1x1 Icons**:
   - Input: `15 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.
3. **Only 2x2 Icons**:
   - Input: `0 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.
4. **Mixed Icons**:
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.
5. **Exact Fit**:
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.
6. **Odd Number of 2x2 Icons**:
   - Input: `0 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.
7. **Max Icons**:
   - Input: `99 99`
   - Expected Output: `100`
   - The program correctly outputs `100`.

### Conclusion
After testing the program with various cases, it seems to handle all the edge cases correctly. The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons appears to be sound.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.

### Explanation
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required by first placing the 2x2 icons and then fitting the 1x1 icons into the remaining space. It handles edge cases such as no icons, only 1x1 or 2x2 icons, and mixed icons effectively. The logic for determining the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons is correct and comprehensive.
