The code snippet provided updates the value of `extra_screen`. The new value of `extra_screen` is calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Given that `extra_space` is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `remaining_cells` is `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, the exact numeric value of `extra_screen` can be derived if all the initial values were known, but since the exact values are not provided, we express the updated state in terms of the variables.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`, `result` is a list containing one element `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**
