The given code snippet modifies the `extra_screen` variable by performing an integer division by 15. This impacts the `extra_screen` variable, but does not affect any other variables directly.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n + 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`, `result` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, and the second element is `screen_require_for_y` if `space_x <= remaining_cells`; otherwise, the second element is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, `extra_space` is `extra_space // 15`.**
