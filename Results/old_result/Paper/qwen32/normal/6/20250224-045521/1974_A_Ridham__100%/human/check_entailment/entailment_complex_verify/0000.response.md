### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program and the annotations to ensure the correctness of the solution.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is simply `x`.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, representing the total space occupied by 2x2 icons.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
   - This logic is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells. To place `y` 2x2 icons, at least `y // 2` screens are needed if `y` is even, and `y // 2 + 1` screens if `y` is odd.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, representing the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - This calculation is correct as it accounts for the total cells occupied by 2x2 icons and subtracts it from the total cells available in the screens allocated for 2x2 icons.

5. **Determine Extra Screens**:
   - If `space_x` (the space required for 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, then no additional screens are needed, and `screen_require_for_y` is the answer.
   - Otherwise, the extra space required is `space_x - remaining_cells`. The number of additional screens needed is calculated based on the extra space required.
   - This logic is correct as it checks if the remaining cells can accommodate the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed.

### Testing with Edge Cases

Let's verify the program with some edge cases:

1. **No Icons**:
   - Input: `0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly outputs `0`.

2. **Only 1x1 Icons**:
   - Input: `15 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

3. **Only 2x2 Icons**:
   - Input: `0 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

4. **Mixed Icons**:
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program correctly outputs `1`.

5. **Exact Fit**:
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.

6. **Odd Number of 2x2 Icons**:
   - Input: `0 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - The program correctly outputs `2`.

7. **Max Icons**:
   - Input: `99 99`
   - Expected Output: `100`
   - The program correctly outputs `100`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining space for 1x1 icons is sound. The annotations accurately describe the program's behavior, and there are no issues identified in the code.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
