The code snippet provided updates the value of `space_x` to be equal to `x * 1`, which is essentially the same as `x`. Therefore, the value of `space_x` remains the same as the initial value of `x`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y` is equal to `y // 2 + 1`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `space_x` is less than or equal to `remaining_cells`, `result` is a list containing one element `screen_require_for_y`. Otherwise, `result` is a list containing one element `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, where `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`, and `extra_screen` is `extra_space // 15` if `extra_space % 15 == 0`, otherwise `extra_space // 15 + 1`.**
