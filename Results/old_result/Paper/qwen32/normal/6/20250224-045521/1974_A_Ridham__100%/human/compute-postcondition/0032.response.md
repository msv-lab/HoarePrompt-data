The given code snippet recalculates the value of `remaining_cells` based on the formula `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. No other variables are directly modified in the snippet provided.

Let's break down the impact:

- `screen_require_for_y` is calculated based on the initial value of `y`.
- `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`.
- The new value of `remaining_cells` is calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

Since `remaining_cells` is recalculated, its value changes, but other variables (`t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `space_x`, `total_space`, and `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`. `result` is a list containing one element `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` as per the initial conditions.**
