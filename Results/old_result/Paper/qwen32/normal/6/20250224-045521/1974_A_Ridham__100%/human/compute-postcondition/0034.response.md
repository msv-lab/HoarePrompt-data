To determine the new state after executing the code, we need to focus on the impact of the line `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `x` is the first integer from the input.
- `y` is the second integer from the input.
- `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0).
- `space_x` is equal to `x`.
- `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`.
- `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2`; otherwise, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2 + 1`.
- `result` is a list containing one element `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` as per the initial conditions.

The line `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` calculates the new value of `extra_space` based on the current values of `space_x` and `remaining_cells`.

The output state will be:
- `t` remains the number of test cases.
- `x` remains the first integer from the input.
- `y` remains the second integer from the input.
- `n` remains `n - 1` (still greater than 0).
- `space_x` remains equal to `x`.
- `space_y` remains equal to `y * 4`.
- `total_space` remains equal to `space_y + space_x`.
- `remaining_cells` remains equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
- `screen_require_for_y` remains the same based on whether `y` is even or odd.
- `result` remains a list containing one element `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`.
- `extra_space` is now equal to `space_x - remaining_cells`.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input, `n` is `n - 1` (and must still be greater than 0), `space_x` is equal to `x`, `space_y` is equal to `y * 4`, `total_space` is equal to `space_y + space_x`, `remaining_cells` is equal to `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`, `screen_require_for_y` is `y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `y // 2 + 1`, `result` is a list containing one element `screen_require_for_y` or `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`, and `extra_space` is `space_x - remaining_cells`.**
