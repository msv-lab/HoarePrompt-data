The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`. To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that this condition holds true.

Let's break down the condition:
- The condition depends on `i` and `x`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `2 ** (i + 1)` must be less than or equal to `x + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18.
- `x` is at least 1.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59.
- `mx` is 0 or 59.
- `i` is 1.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- We need to adjust `x` and/or `i` such that `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

Since `i` is currently 1, the condition becomes `2 ** (1 + 1) <= x + 1`, which simplifies to `4 <= x + 1` or `x >= 3`.

Therefore, `x` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time. No adjustment to `i` is necessary in this case, as `i` being 1 already satisfies the condition if `x` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 3; `subseq_lens` is an empty list or contains the integer 59; `mx` is 0 or 59; `i` is 1**
