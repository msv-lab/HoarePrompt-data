Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 1; `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer 59; `mx` is 0; `i` is 59; `i` is not equal to 0.**

In natural language: The list `subseq_lens` now contains the integer 59. All other variables retain their initial values.
