The value of `x` is decreased by \(2^{59} - 1\). The other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` is 59, the expression \(2^{59} - 1\) is a specific value. Therefore, `x` is updated to its previous value minus \(2^{59} - 1\).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is at least 1 minus \(2^{59} - 1\); `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer 59; `mx` is 0; `i` is 59; `i` is not equal to 0.**
