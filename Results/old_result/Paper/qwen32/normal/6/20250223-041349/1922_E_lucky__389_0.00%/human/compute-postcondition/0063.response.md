To determine what will be printed by the `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the given initial state and understand the context of the variables involved.

### Initial State Recap:
- `t`: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000 (though `t` is not used in the given print statement).
- `X`: An integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18.
- `x`: Initialized to 0 (though `x` is not used in the given print statement).
- `subseq_lens`: A list containing the sequence of powers of 2 that were subtracted from `X-1` in descending order.
- `mx`: The largest power of 2 that was used in the process of generating `subseq_lens`.
- `ansv`: A list consisting of all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first element, and `ansv` must contain at least one element.
- `i`: An index used to access elements from `ansv`.

### Analysis:
Given the context, `ansv` is derived from `subseq_lens` by removing the first element. This means `ansv` contains the sequence of powers of 2 (excluding the largest one) that were subtracted from `X-1`.

The `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `i` of `ansv`, followed by a space.

### Output:
Since the exact values of `X` and `i` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `ansv[i]`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the given information.

Output: **ansv[i] (where ansv[i] is the element at index i of the list ansv, which contains the sequence of powers of 2 used in the process of generating subseq_lens, excluding the first element)**
