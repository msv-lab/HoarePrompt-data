The code snippet creates a list `ansv` containing integers from 0 to `mx-1`. The values of `t`, `X`, `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx` remain unchanged, except for `ansv` which is newly defined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000, and for each of the `t` test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is 0; `subseq_lens` contains the sequence of powers of 2 that were subtracted from `X-1` in descending order; `mx` is the largest power of 2 that was used in the process; `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1`.**
