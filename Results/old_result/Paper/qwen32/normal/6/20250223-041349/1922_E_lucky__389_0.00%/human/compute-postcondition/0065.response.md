To determine the output of the `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the given initial state and the relevant variables.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 1000.
2. **`X`**: An integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18.
3. **`x`**: Initialized to 0.
4. **`subseq_lens`**: A list containing the sequence of powers of 2 that were subtracted from `X-1` in descending order.
5. **`mx`**: The largest power of 2 that was used in the process.
6. **`ansv`**: A list consisting of all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first element. This list must contain at least one element.
7. **`i`**: Initialized to 1.

### Key Points:
- **`subseq_lens`**: This list contains powers of 2 in descending order that sum up to `X-1`.
- **`ansv`**: This list is derived from `subseq_lens` by removing the first element. Therefore, `ansv` contains the remaining powers of 2 from `subseq_lens` starting from the second element.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is set to 1, which means the print statement will access the second element of `ansv`.

### Output Analysis:
- Since `ansv` is derived from `subseq_lens` by removing the first element, the element at index `i` (which is 1) in `ansv` corresponds to the second element in `subseq_lens`.
- Therefore, the output of `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` will be the second element in the list `subseq_lens`.

### Conclusion:
The exact value of the second element in `subseq_lens` cannot be determined without knowing `X`, but we can describe the output precisely based on the given initial state.

Output: **the second element of `subseq_lens` (where `subseq_lens` is the list of powers of 2 subtracted from `X-1` in descending order)**
