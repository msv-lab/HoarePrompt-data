The value of `x` is decremented by 1. The other variables `t` and `X` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is `x - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, `X` is an integer such that 2 <= `X` <= 10^18; `x` is `x - 1`.**
