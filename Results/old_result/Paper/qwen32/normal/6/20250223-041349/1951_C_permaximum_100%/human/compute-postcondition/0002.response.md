Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), and `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list; `total_cost` is 0.**

Natural Language: The variable `total_cost` has been initialized to 0. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, and `pq`) retain their initial values and constraints.
