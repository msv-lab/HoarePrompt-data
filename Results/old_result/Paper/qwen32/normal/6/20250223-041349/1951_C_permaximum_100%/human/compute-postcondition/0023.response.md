The code snippet `total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy` updates the `total_cost` by adding the product of `price` and `tickets_to_buy` to it. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code.

Given the initial state, `total_cost` was already calculated as `price * tickets_to_buy + price * tickets_to_buy`, which simplifies to `2 * price * tickets_to_buy`. After executing the code, `total_cost` will be updated to `2 * price * tickets_to_buy + price * tickets_to_buy`, which simplifies to `3 * price * tickets_to_buy`.

Therefore, the updated `total_cost` is `3 * price * tickets_to_buy`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` must be greater than `2 * min(m, k)`, `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element, `total_cost` is `3 * price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) + min(m, k - min(m, k))`, `price_increase` is `price_increase + tickets_to_buy`, `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `2 * price_increase`, `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list, `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`, `price, day` are the smallest price and its index from the original `pq` before it was popped.**
