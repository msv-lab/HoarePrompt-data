Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided code does not handle the problem correctly. The main issue lies in the fact that it uses a greedy approach by always purchasing tickets on the day with the currently lowest price, without considering the future price increases. This can lead to suboptimal solutions in some cases.

Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2 3
3 2 5 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
```

**Explanation of Expected Output:**
- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets for 2 * 2 = 4. Prices increase by 2 -> [5, 4, 7, 3]
- Day 4: Buy 1 ticket for 1 * 3 = 3. Total cost = 4 + 3 = 7

However, the optimal strategy is:
- Day 2: Buy 1 ticket for 1 * 2 = 2. Prices increase by 1 -> [4, 3, 6, 2]
- Day 4: Buy 2 tickets for 2 * 2 = 4. Total cost = 2 + 4 = 6

**Actual Output from the Code:**
```
7
```

The code's greedy approach fails to find the optimal solution in this case. Therefore, the code is incorrect.

To solve this problem correctly, a dynamic programming (DP) approach or a more sophisticated greedy strategy that considers future price increases would be necessary.
