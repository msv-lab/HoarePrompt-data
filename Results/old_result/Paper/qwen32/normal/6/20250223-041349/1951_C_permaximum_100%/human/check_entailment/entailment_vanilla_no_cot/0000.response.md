Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem constraints, particularly the price increase mechanism after purchasing tickets on a given day. The current implementation modifies the `price_increase` globally, which affects all subsequent days, but it does not update the prices in the priority queue accordingly. 

Here's why the current solution is incorrect:
- After purchasing tickets on a specific day, the prices for all subsequent days should increase by the number of tickets bought on that day.
- The priority queue (`pq`) should be updated to reflect these new prices. However, in the current implementation, the priority queue is not updated after each purchase, leading to incorrect calculations.

To fix this issue, after purchasing tickets on a specific day, the program should update the prices for all subsequent days in the priority queue and re-heapify it if necessary. This ensures that the cheapest available ticket price is always considered for the next purchase.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(prices[i], i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        # Update the prices for all subsequent days in the priority queue
        new_pq = []
        for (p, d) in pq:
            if d > day:
                p += tickets_to_buy
            new_pq.append((p, d))
        heapq.heapify(new_pq)
        pq = new_pq
    return total_cost
```

This corrected version ensures that the priority queue is updated correctly after each purchase, reflecting the increased prices for subsequent days.
