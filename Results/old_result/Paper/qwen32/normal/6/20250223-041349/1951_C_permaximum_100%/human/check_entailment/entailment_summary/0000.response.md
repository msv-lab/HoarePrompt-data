### Reasoning:
The provided Python program aims to find the minimum spending required to purchase `k` tickets over `n` days, given the constraints that no more than `m` tickets can be bought on any single day and the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets bought on any given day for all subsequent days.

#### Key Points:
1. **Heap Usage**: The program uses a min-heap (priority queue) to always buy tickets on the day with the lowest current price. This is a greedy approach that ensures that tickets are bought at the lowest possible price at each step.
2. **Price Adjustment**: After buying tickets on a day, the program correctly adjusts the price for all subsequent days by adding the number of tickets bought on that day to the `price_increase` variable.
3. **Loop Until `k` Tickets Bought**: The program continues to purchase tickets day by day until the total number of tickets bought equals `k`.
4. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is updated by multiplying the current price (adjusted by `price_increase`) by the number of tickets bought on that day and adding it to `total_cost`.

#### Validation Against Example:
- **First Test Case**: The program correctly buys tickets in a way that minimizes cost, resulting in a total cost of 10.
- **Second Test Case**: The program buys 2 tickets each day for 4 days, resulting in a total cost of 64.
- **Third Test Case**: The program buys 1 ticket on the first day, resulting in a total cost of 1.
- **Fourth Test Case**: The program buys tickets in a way that minimizes cost, resulting in a total cost of 72.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem according to the provided problem description and the examples.
