The code snippet `price_increase += tickets_to_buy` increments the value of `price_increase` by the value of `tickets_to_buy`. 

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `prices`, `pq`, `total_cost`, `tickets_bought`, `price_increase`, `price`, `day`, and `tickets_to_buy` have specific constraints and values. The only variable that changes due to the execution of the code is `price_increase`.

Since `tickets_to_buy` is defined as `min(m, k)`, the value of `price_increase` will be increased by `min(m, k)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= min(n * m, 10^9), `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element; `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy`; `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`; `price_increase` is `price_increase + min(m, k)`; `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq`; `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list; `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k)`**.
