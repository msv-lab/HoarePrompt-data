The code snippet provided increments the `tickets_bought` variable by the value of `tickets_to_buy`. To determine the new state, we need to account for this change.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9
- `k` must be greater than `tickets_bought`
- `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9
- `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element
- `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy` plus `price * tickets_to_buy`
- `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k)`
- `price_increase` is `price_increase + min(m, k)`
- `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`
- `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list
- `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`

The line `tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy` increments the `tickets_bought` variable by the value of `tickets_to_buy`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^9, `k` must be greater than `tickets_bought`, `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `pq` is a heap of tuples where each tuple is (price, index) from the `prices` list with one less element, `total_cost` is `price * tickets_to_buy` plus `price * tickets_to_buy`, `tickets_bought` is `min(m, k) + min(m, k - min(m, k))`, `price_increase` is `price_increase + min(m, k)`, `price` is the smallest price from the original `pq` plus `price_increase`, `day` is the index corresponding to the smallest price in the `prices` list, `tickets_to_buy` is `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`**

In simpler terms, `tickets_bought` is now `min(m, k) + min(m, k - min(m, k))`. All other variables remain unchanged.
