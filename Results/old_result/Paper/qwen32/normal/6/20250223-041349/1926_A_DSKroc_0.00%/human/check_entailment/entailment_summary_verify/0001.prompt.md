You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of a distinct string of length 5 containing only the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. After processing all test cases, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A's in the last string is greater than the count of 'B's; otherwise, it prints 'B'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's carefully analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

The task is to determine which letter, 'A' or 'B', appears most frequently in each of the given strings of length 5. The program should output the most frequent letter for each test case.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, where each iteration processes one test case.

2. **Counting Characters:**
   - For each test case, it initializes two counters: `ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B'.
   - It reads a string `s` of length 5.
   - It iterates over each character in the string:
     - If the character is 'A', it increments `ac`.
     - Otherwise, it increments `bc`.

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After the loop for a given test case, the program compares `ac` and `bc`.
   - If `ac` is greater than `bc`, it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

### Issues in the Program:

The primary issue with the program is the placement of the comparison and print statements. The comparison and print statements are outside of the loop that iterates over the test cases. This means that the program will only compare the counts from the last test case and print the result for that case `t` times.

### Correct Placement:

The comparison and print statements should be inside the loop that processes each test case. This way, after processing each string, the program will output the result for that specific test case.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        # Comparison and print moved inside the loop
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')

# The function call is implied by the problem statement, so no need to call func() here.
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not output the correct result for each test case. The comparison and print statements need to be placed inside the loop that processes each test case.
