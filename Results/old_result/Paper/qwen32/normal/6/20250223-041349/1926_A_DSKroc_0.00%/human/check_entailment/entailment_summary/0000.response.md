Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical error in its implementation. The issue lies in the placement of the print statement. The program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' for each test case, but the print statement is outside the loop that processes each test case. As a result, the program only prints the result for the last test case, not for each individual test case as required by the problem statement.

The correct approach would be to place the print statement inside the loop that processes each test case, so that the result for each test case is printed immediately after it is computed.

Correctness: **False**
