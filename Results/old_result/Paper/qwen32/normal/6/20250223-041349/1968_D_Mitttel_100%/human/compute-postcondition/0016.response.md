The `while` loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be `True`. Let's analyze the given state and determine which adjustments are necessary.

- `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and the integer at index `s` is 1 and all other integers are 0. This means `vis[s]` is currently `1` (since the integer at index `s` is `1`).
- `k` is at least 0, but we need `k > 0` for the loop to execute.

Given that `vis[s]` is `1`, the loop will not execute because the `not vis[s]` condition is `False`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `vis[s]` to be `0` and ensure `k > 0`.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is `p[p[P_S]]` and `s` is not equal to `P_B`, `k` is at least 1, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `cur` is `2 * a[s]`, `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and the integer at index `s` is 0 and all other integers are 0.**

This ensures that `not vis[s]` is `True` and `k > 0` is `True`, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
