You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, p is a list of n integers representing a permutation of length n where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, s is a tuple containing four integers (t, n, P_B, P_S) where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), P_B and P_S are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), and k is the duration of the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: vis is a list where vis[i] is 1 for all visited positions i, mx is the maximum value of cur + k * a[s] encountered, cur is the cumulative sum of a[s] for all visited positions, k is the remaining duration of the game, and s is the last visited position before termination.
    return mx
    #The program returns mx, which is the maximum value of cur + k * a[s] encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `p` of `n` integers representing a permutation, a tuple `s` containing four integers (t, n, P_B, P_S), and an integer `k`. It returns `mx`, which is the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns mx, which is the maximum value of cur + k * a[s] encountered.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
