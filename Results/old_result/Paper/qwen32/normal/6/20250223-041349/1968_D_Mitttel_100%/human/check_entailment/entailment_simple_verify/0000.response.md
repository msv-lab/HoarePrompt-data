To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's systematically analyze the problem description, the code, and the annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Permutation Game**: Players Bodya and Sasha play a game where they start at different positions in a permutation.
- **Game Mechanics**: Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation. Each turn, they add the value at their current position to their score.
- **Objective**: After `k` turns, the player with the higher score wins. If the scores are equal, it's a draw.

### Code Analysis:
The code reads multiple test cases. For each test case:
1. It reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
2. It adjusts the permutation `p` to be 0-based by subtracting 1 from each element.
3. It incorrectly adjusts the array `a` by subtracting 1 from each element, which is not necessary and incorrect as `a` contains scores.
4. It calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha to calculate their maximum possible scores.
5. It compares the scores and prints the result.

### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: Calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from position `s` in `k` turns.
- **Logic**:
  - Initializes `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current score), and `vis` (visited positions).
  - Iterates while the current position `s` has not been visited and `k` turns remain.
  - Updates `vis[s]` to mark the position as visited.
  - Updates `mx` to be the maximum of the current `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`.
  - Updates `cur` by adding `a[s]` to it.
  - Decrements `k` by 1.
  - Moves to the next position `s = p[s]`.
  - Returns `mx` as the maximum score.

### Annotations:
- **State Before Function Call**: `a` is a list of scores, `p` is a permutation, `s` is the starting position, and `k` is the number of turns.
- **State During Function Execution**:
  - `vis` keeps track of visited positions.
  - `mx` is the maximum score encountered.
  - `cur` is the cumulative score.
  - `k` is the remaining turns.
  - `s` is the current position.
- **State After Function Execution**: The function returns `mx`, the maximum score.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Adjustment of Array `a`**:
   - The code incorrectly adjusts the array `a` by subtracting 1 from each element, which is not necessary and incorrect as `a` contains scores.
   - **Fix**: Remove the line `a[i] -= 1`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The line `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` incorrectly assumes the player can stay and collect the score `a[s]` for `k` turns.
   - **Fix**: The function should simulate the game for `k` turns, updating the scores based on whether the player stays or moves, and correctly handle cycles.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Cycles**:
   - The code does not correctly handle cycles in the permutation. If the player enters a cycle, they will keep collecting the score of the cycle repeatedly.
   - **Fix**: Detect cycles and calculate the score accordingly.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the scores for each player over `k` turns. It should simulate the game for `k` turns, updating the scores based on whether the player stays or moves, and correctly handle cycles.

### Correctness Assessment:
Given the identified issues, the program is **incorrect**. The adjustments to the array `a` and the incorrect calculation of scores prevent the program from correctly determining the winner of the game.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
