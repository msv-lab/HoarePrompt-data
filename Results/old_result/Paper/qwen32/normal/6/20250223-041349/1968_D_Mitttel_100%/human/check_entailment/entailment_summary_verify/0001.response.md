Let's carefully analyze the given program and the provided function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` by subtracting 1 from each element to make them zero-based, which is correct for Python indexing.
   - The program also adjusts the indices of `a` by subtracting 1 from each element, which is incorrect. The values in `a` represent scores and should not be adjusted.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position.
   - The function initializes `mx` to store the maximum score, `cur` to store the current score, and `vis` to keep track of visited positions.
   - It iterates while the current position has not been visited and there are turns left (`k > 0`).
   - During each iteration:
     - It marks the current position as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to be the maximum of the current `mx` and the potential score if the player stays in the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the score of the current position to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves to the next position as defined by the permutation `p`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The program incorrectly adjusts the indices of `a` by subtracting 1. This is a critical error because the values in `a` are scores and should not be modified. The correct approach is to only adjust the indices of `p` to make them zero-based.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The logic in `func_1` to calculate the score is flawed. The calculation `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` assumes that staying in the current position for the remaining turns will yield the maximum score, which is not necessarily true. The player can choose to move or stay at each step, and the correct approach should consider the best possible moves at each step. However, the provided function summary suggests that the function is intended to calculate the maximum score based on the described logic, so we will assume the function is intended to work as described but with the correct input.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program is not correct due to the incorrect adjustment of the indices of `a`. The values in `a` should remain unchanged.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the index adjustment of `a` and the potential flaw in the score calculation logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
