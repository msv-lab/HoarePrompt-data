The given code snippet updates the variable `mx` by comparing its current value with the value of `cur + k * a[s]`. The other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `cur`, `vis`) remain unchanged unless they are part of the expression that calculates the new value for `mx`.

Here's how the output state is derived:
- `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`.
- All other variables (`a`, `p`, `s`, `cur`, `vis`) retain their initial values.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of length `n` where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `s` is a tuple containing four integers (t, n, P_B, P_S) where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the permutation, `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively, `k` is greater than 0; `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]`; `cur` is 0; `vis` is a list of `n` integers where the integer at index `P_B` is 1 and all other integers are 0.**
