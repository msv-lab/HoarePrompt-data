You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

    Sasha
    Sasha
    Bodya
    
Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The program provided contains a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Let's break down the problems:

1. **Incorrect Adjustment of Indices**:
   The code adjusts the indices of the permutation and array by subtracting 1:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       p[i] -= 1
       a[i] -= 1
   ```
   This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that the permutation and array are 1-based, meaning they already use indices from 1 to n. Adjusting them to 0-based indexing would be correct, but the array values `a` should not be adjusted since they represent scores and are not indices.

2. **Incorrect Calculation in `func_1`**:
   The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score for a player starting from a given position `s`:
   ```python
   mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
   ```
   This line assumes that the player can stay in the current position and collect the score `a[s]` for `k` turns, which is not the case. The player can either stay or move to `p[s]` on each turn. The correct approach should consider the score collected on each turn and whether to stay or move.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Cycles**:
   The code does not correctly handle cycles in the permutation. If the player enters a cycle, they will keep collecting the score of the cycle repeatedly. The code should detect cycles and calculate the score accordingly.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the scores for each player over `k` turns. It should simulate the game for `k` turns, updating the scores based on whether the player stays or moves, and correctly handle cycles.

Here is a counterexample where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
3 3 1 2
3 1 2
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation:**
- Turn 1: Bodya is at position 1 (score: 1), Sasha is at position 2 (score: 2).
- Turn 2: Bodya moves to position 3 (score: 1 + 3 = 4), Sasha moves to position 1 (score: 2 + 1 = 3).
- Turn 3: Bodya stays at position 3 (score: 4 + 3 = 7), Sasha moves to position 3 (score: 3 + 3 = 6).

Final scores: Bodya = 7, Sasha = 6. Expected output is "Bodya", but the program might not handle this correctly due to the issues mentioned.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all potential cases, and thus the Correctness is **False**.
