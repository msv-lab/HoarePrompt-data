The code snippet provided reads three new integer values from user input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. This means the previous values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are replaced with the new input values. The values of other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `i`, and the list of friend pairs) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`u`, `v`, and `f` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is 0; `a` is `f` + `f`; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 2.**
