Output State: **`u`, `v`, and `f` are the three integers provided by the user input; `n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is 0; `a` is `f`; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is 1.**

Natural Language Explanation: The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` have been updated to the three integers provided by the user input. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, the list of friend pairs, `c`, `s`, `a`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
