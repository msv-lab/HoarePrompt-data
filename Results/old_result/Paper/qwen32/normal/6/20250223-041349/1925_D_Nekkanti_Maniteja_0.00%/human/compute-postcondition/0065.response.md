Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`; `a` is `sum_f`; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is `m + k`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `c * i * c * m + c * a`. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
