Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are the new integer values provided by user input, each at least 1; `M` is 1000000007; the list of friend pairs remains unchanged; `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`; `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`; `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations; `k` is greater than 0; `i` is `m-1`**

Natural language explanation: The variable `s` has been updated to include the value of `c * i * c * m + c * a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
