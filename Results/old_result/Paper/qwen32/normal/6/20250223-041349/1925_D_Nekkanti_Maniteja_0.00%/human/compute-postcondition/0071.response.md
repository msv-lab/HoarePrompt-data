To determine what will be printed when the `print(s % M)` statement executes, we need to break down the calculation of `s` and understand the values of the variables involved.

### Given Information:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by user input, each at least 1.
- `M` is a constant value `1000000007`.
- `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`.
- `s` is calculated as `k * c * a + (k * (k - 1) / 2) * c * m`.
- `a` is `sum_f` (though `sum_f` is not explicitly defined, we'll assume it's a known value).
- `k` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `m` (though `i` is not used in the calculation of `s`).

### Calculation Breakdown:
1. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse (`c`)**:
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1)` modulo `1000000007`. This means `c` is a value such that `(n * (n - 1)) * c â‰¡ 1 (mod 1000000007)`.

2. **Expression for `s`**:
   - `s = k * c * a + (k * (k - 1) / 2) * c * m`
   - Here, `a` is `sum_f`, which is a known value.
   - `k * (k - 1) / 2` is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose 2 items from `k` items.

3. **Modulo Operation (`s % M`)**:
   - The final result to be printed is `s % M`, which ensures the result is within the bounds of the modulo `1000000007`.

### Output Description:
The value printed will be the result of the expression `s % M`, where `s` is calculated as described above. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `sum_f` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, we can describe the value precisely based on the given information.

Output: **s % M (where s = k * c * a + (k * (k - 1) / 2) * c * m, c is the modular multiplicative inverse of n * (n - 1) modulo 1000000007, and a is sum_f)**
