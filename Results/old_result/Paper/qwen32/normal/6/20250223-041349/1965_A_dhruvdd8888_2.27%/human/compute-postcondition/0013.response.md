The value of `cd` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning, and the length of `nums` is at least 3, `nums[i + 1] - nums[i]` equals 1, and `cd` is 1.
