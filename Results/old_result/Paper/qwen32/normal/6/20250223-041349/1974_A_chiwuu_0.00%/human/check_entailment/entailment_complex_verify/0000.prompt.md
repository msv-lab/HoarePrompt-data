You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: 
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons. For each test case, it calculates and outputs the total number of icons required, ensuring that the number of 1x1 icons is accommodated after placing the 2x2 icons.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Problem Description Recap
- Each screen is a grid of size 5x3.
- We have `x` applications with 1x1 icons and `y` applications with 2x2 icons.
- We need to find the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.

### Program Analysis

The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum number of screens needed based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`t`)**:
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - Each screen has 15 cells (5x3).
   - To find the number of screens needed for `b` 2x2 icons, the code calculates `t = b * 2` and then divides by 5 (the number of 2x2 icons that fit in 15 cells). This is incorrect because the actual calculation should be based on the number of 2x2 icons fitting in 15 cells, which is 3 (not 5).

2. **Adjust the count of 1x1 icons (`t1`)**:
   - The code calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which is the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - It then checks if `t1` is sufficient to place the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Identifying an Incorrect Case

Let's consider a test case:

- Input: `x = 0`, `y = 3`
- Expected Output: `2` (Each screen can fit 3 2x2 icons, so 2 screens are needed for 3 2x2 icons).

However, the program will calculate:
- `t = 3 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 2` (incorrectly, it should be 2 // 3 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2, but the logic is flawed).
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 30 - 12 = 18` (which is correct).
- Since `t1 >= a` (18 >= 0), `t` remains 2, which is correct for this case but the logic is flawed.

Let's consider another test case:

- Input: `x = 1`, `y = 2`
- Expected Output: `1` (2 2x2 icons fit in one screen, and there is space for 7 1x1 icons).

However, the program will calculate:
- `t = 2 * 2 // 5 + 1 = 1` (incorrectly, it should be 2 // 3 + 1 = 1).
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 15 - 8 = 7` (which is correct).
- Since `t1 >= a` (7 >= 1), `t` remains 1, which is correct for this case but the logic is flawed.

The logic for calculating the number of screens for 2x2 icons is flawed. The correct approach is to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons based on the number of 2x2 icons fitting in 15 cells (which is 3, not 5).

### Conclusion

The program does not handle the calculation of screens for 2x2 icons correctly. It uses an incorrect divisor (5 instead of 3) for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.

**Correctness: False**

Explanation: The program uses an incorrect divisor when calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
