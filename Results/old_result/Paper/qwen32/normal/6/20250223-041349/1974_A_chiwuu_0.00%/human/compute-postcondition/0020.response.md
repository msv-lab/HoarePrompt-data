Output State: **`t` is `t + t2 // 15 + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer; `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer; `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `t = (b * 2) // 5`, otherwise `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - t1`; `t2` is not divisible by 15.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + 1`. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, `t2`) retain their initial values and conditions.
