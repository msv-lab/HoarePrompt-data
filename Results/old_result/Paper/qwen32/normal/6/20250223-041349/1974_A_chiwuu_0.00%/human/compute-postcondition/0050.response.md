Given the initial state and the provided Python code snippet, we need to determine the new state after executing the code.

Initial State:
- `t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`
- `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4)
- `a` is the first value from input as an integer
- `b` is the second value from input as an integer
- `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`
- `i` is `x + 2`

Code to execute:
```python
t2 = a - t1
```

Impact of the code:
- `t2` is assigned the value of `a - t1`.

Since `t1` is already defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, we substitute this into the equation for `t2`:
- `t2 = a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`
- `t2 = a - t * 15 + b * 4`

Therefore, the new value of `t2` is `a - t * 15 + b * 4`.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`; `t2` is `a - t * 15 + b * 4`.**
