Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. Let's analyze why:

1. **Calculation of `t`**:
   - `t` is calculated as `b * 2`, which is the number of 1x1 spaces occupied by the 2x2 icons.
   - It then calculates how many full 5x3 screens (which have 15 cells) are needed to fit these 2x2 icons.
   - This part seems correct, but the logic after this is flawed.

2. **Calculation of `t1`**:
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which is the number of remaining 1x1 spaces on the screens that have been allocated for 2x2 icons.
   - However, this calculation is incorrect because `t` is not the number of screens but the number of 1x1 spaces occupied by 2x2 icons divided by 5 (rounded up).

3. **Calculation of `t2`**:
   - `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, which is the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The logic to calculate the number of additional screens needed for `t2` is flawed. It doesn't consider the most efficient way to place the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells_needed = b * 4 + a  # Total cells needed for all icons
        screens = b  # Start with screens needed for 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = (screens * 15) - (b * 4)  # Remaining cells on these screens
        
        if remaining_cells < a:
            # Calculate additional screens needed for remaining 1x1 icons
            additional_cells_needed = a - remaining_cells
            screens += (additional_cells_needed + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
        
        print(screens)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, the logic for calculating the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is corrected to ensure the minimum number of screens is used.
