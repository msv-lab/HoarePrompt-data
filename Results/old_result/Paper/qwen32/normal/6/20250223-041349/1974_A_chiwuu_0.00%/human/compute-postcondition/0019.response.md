Postcondition: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `(b * 2) // 5 + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first integer from the current input line as an integer; `b` is the second integer from the current input line as an integer; `t1` is `((b * 2) // 5) * 15 - b * 4` if `t = (b * 2) // 5`, otherwise `t1` is `(((b * 2) // 5) + 1) * 15 - b * 4`; `t2` is `a - t1`; `t2` is not divisible by 15.**
