The code snippet provided converts the variable `a` from a string to an integer. The other variables (`n`, `b`, `t`, `t1`, `i`) are not directly affected by this conversion.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is calculated based on the value of `b`.
- `n` is the number of test cases.
- `a` is the first value from input as a string.
- `b` is the second value from input as a string.
- `t1` is calculated based on the values of `t` and `b`.
- `i` is calculated based on the value of `x`.

After executing `a = int(a)`, `a` changes from a string to an integer, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is the first value from input as an integer; `b` is the second value from input as a string; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 2`.**
