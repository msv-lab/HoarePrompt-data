The code provided reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. The initial state includes the description of `t` and the structure of the following input lines, but the variable `n` is not mentioned in the initial state. After executing the code snippet `n = int(input())`, the variable `n` will be assigned the value of the first integer read from the input, which is `t`.

Output State: **The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 99), where `x` is the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` is the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. `n` is assigned the value of `t`.**
