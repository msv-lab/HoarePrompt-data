To determine the new value of `t` after the given code executes, we need to follow the steps and calculations carefully.

Initial State: 
- `t` is calculated as `(b * 2) // 5` if `t % 5 == 0`, otherwise `t` is `((b * 2) // 5) + 1`
- `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4)
- `a` is an integer
- `b` is an integer
- `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`
- `i` is `x + 1`
- `t2` is `a - t1`

The code snippet modifies `t` as follows:
```
t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
```

Let's break down the new value of `t`:
1. `t2 // 15` is the integer division of `t2` by 15.
2. `t` is then updated to its current value plus `t2 // 15` plus 1.

Therefore, the new value of `t` is `t + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`.

Given that `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, we can substitute `t1` in the equation:
- `t2 = a - (t * 15 - b * 4)`
- `t2 = a - t * 15 + b * 4`
- `t2 // 15 = (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15`

Thus, the new `t` is:
- `t = t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`

The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `t1`, `i`, and `t2` remain unchanged. Only `t` is updated.

Output State: **`t` is `t + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15 + 1`; `n` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4); `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`; `i` is `x + 1`; `t2` is `a - t1`.**
