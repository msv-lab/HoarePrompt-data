### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the code correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding:
- **Beautiful Array**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= |a| - 1`), such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`, and replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]`.
- **Task**: For a given beautiful array, determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make it stop being beautiful. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array) and `arr` (the array itself).

2. **Check if all elements are the same**:
   - The `flag` variable is set to `True` initially.
   - It iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same. If any two consecutive elements are different, `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.

3. **Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove**:
   - `ans` is initialized to infinity (`Decimal('Infinity')`).
   - `val` is set to the first element of the array, and `cnt` is initialized to `0`.
   - The code then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same (`val`). When a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to `0`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time to account for the last group of consecutive elements.
   - If `flag` is `True` (meaning all elements were the same), it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

#### Key Points:
- **Correctness for all elements the same**: If all elements are the same, the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the code correctly prints `-1`.
- **Minimum elements to remove**: The code correctly identifies the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the pattern of consecutive elements being the same. This is done by finding the smallest group of consecutive elements that can be removed to disrupt the beautiful property.

#### Conclusion:
The code correctly handles the cases where the array is already beautiful with all elements the same and correctly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful in other cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
