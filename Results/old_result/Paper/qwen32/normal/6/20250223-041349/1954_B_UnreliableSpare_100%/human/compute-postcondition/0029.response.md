The code snippet provided is:

```python
cnt = 0
```

This line of code sets the value of the variable `cnt` to `0`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True if all elements in `arr` are the same, otherwise False; `val` is the first element of `arr`; `i` is 1; `cnt` is 0; `ans` is the minimum of `Decimal('Infinity')` and `cnt` if `arr[i]` is equal to `val`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum of `0` and `cnt`.**
