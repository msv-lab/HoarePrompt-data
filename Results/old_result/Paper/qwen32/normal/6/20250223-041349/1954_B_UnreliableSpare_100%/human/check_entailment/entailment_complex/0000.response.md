### Reasoning:

The program is supposed to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. The provided implementation has a few issues that need to be addressed.

1. **Checking if all elements are the same:**
   - The code correctly checks if all elements in the array are the same using the `flag` variable. If all elements are the same, it outputs `-1` as expected.

2. **Finding the minimum length of contiguous subsequences:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of contiguous subsequences where all elements are the same is flawed. The `ans` variable is supposed to store the minimum length of such subsequences, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the end of the array. Additionally, the `cnt` variable is reset to `0` when a different element is encountered, which is correct, but it does not account for the last subsequence at the end of the array properly.

3. **Updating `ans` at the end of the loop:**
   - After the loop, the code correctly updates `ans` with the last `cnt` value, ensuring that the last subsequence is considered.

However, the program has a logical flaw in its overall approach to solving the problem. It only considers contiguous subsequences of the same elements but does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

- If all elements are the same, output `-1`.
- Otherwise, we need to find the longest contiguous subsequence of the same elements and remove elements from the array such that no contiguous subsequence of the same elements remains. The minimum number of elements to remove is `n - max_length`, where `max_length` is the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of the same elements.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        val, cnt = arr[0], 0
        max_length = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == val:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                max_length = max(max_length, cnt)
                cnt = 1
            val = arr[i]
        
        max_length = max(max_length, cnt)
        print(n - max_length)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
