Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `i` is 3; `flag` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of all variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
