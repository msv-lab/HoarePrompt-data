The given code snippet only initializes a variable `flag` to `True`. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `arr`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will retain the initial values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `arr`, with the addition of the `flag` variable being set to `True`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is True.**
