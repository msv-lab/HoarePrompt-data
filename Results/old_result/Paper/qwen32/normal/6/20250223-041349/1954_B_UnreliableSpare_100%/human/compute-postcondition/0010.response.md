Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n; The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5; The given array `a` is beautiful; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `flag` is False; `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables remain unchanged, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
