Reasoning:
The provided program is intended to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's logic and correctness:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Check if All Elements are the Same**: The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the previous one. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are different, it sets a flag `flag` to `False`. If all elements are the same, the flag remains `True`.

3. **Determine Minimum Length of Contiguous Subsequences**: If the flag is `False` (i.e., not all elements are the same), the program calculates the minimum length of contiguous subsequences where all elements are the same. It does this by iterating through the array and counting the length of contiguous subsequences of identical elements. It keeps track of the minimum length found.

4. **Output the Result**: If the flag is `True` (all elements are the same), the program outputs `-1` because it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. If the flag is `False`, it outputs the minimum length of contiguous subsequences of identical elements, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

However, there seems to be a logical flaw in the program. The program calculates the minimum length of contiguous subsequences of identical elements, but this does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. The correct approach should involve checking the structure of the array and determining the minimum number of changes required to break the beautiful property.

Given the problem's requirements and the provided execution summary, the program seems to be attempting to solve the problem as described, but the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
