Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer; `s1` is the newly input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `_` is `n + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`. If at the current index `i`, `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` if `a1 - a2` is greater than 0, otherwise `hd` remains `a1 - a2`. `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` and `_` is `n + 1`. If `s1[i]` is not '1' or `s2[i]` is not '0', `hd` remains `a1 - a2` and `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`, with `_` still being `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. Otherwise, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decreased by 1. `_` is `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `hd` is not greater than 0, no changes are made to `hd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `hd` > 0, then `hd` is decreased by 1. If `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`, then `res` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
