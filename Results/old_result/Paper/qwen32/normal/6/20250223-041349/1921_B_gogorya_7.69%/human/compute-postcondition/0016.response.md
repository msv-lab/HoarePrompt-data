Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`. If `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', then `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` and `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1`. Otherwise, `hd` is `a1 - a2` and `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`.**
