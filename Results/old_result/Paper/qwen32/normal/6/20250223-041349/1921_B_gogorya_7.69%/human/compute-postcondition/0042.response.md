Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is the new input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` and `hd` is greater than 0; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `_` is incremented by 1; `hd` is `hd - 1`. The loop continues.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply instructs the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values, and the loop continues.
