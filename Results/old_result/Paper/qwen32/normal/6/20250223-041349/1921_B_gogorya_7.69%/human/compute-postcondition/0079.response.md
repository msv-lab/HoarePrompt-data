The `continue` statement in Python skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no changes to any variables or conditions in the provided code snippet, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`, `hd` is updated based on the conditions provided and then decreased by 1, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2) + 1` if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' otherwise `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`, `_` is `n + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**
