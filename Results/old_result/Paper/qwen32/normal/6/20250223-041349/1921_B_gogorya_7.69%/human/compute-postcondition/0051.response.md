The code snippet provided increments the variable `res` by 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `hd`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is incremented by 1; if `hd` was greater than 0, then `hd` is decreased by 1; `res` is incremented by 1.**
