Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4; `n` is greater than 0; `s1` is an input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2` and `hd` is greater than 0; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)` which is equal to `hd`**
