The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is a conventional throwaway variable in Python) and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Since `_` is not a variable that needs to be initialized or adjusted, the only state that needs to be ensured is that `t` is set to a value that allows the loop to execute.

Given that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. 

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4**
