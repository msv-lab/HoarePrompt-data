The code snippet `res = abs(a1 - a2)` updates the value of `res` to be the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`. The initial state indicates that `res` was previously calculated as `abs(a1 - a2) + count_10`. After executing the given line, `res` no longer includes `count_10`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the newly input integer; `s1` is the newly input string; `s2` is the next input string; `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`; `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`; `hd` is `a1 - a2`; `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`; `_` is `n + 1`.**
