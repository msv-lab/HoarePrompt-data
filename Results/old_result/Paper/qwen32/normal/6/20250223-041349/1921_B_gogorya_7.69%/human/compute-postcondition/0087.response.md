The code snippet `res += 1` increments the variable `res` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `i`, and `hd`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that `n` >= 1, `s1` is the newly input string, `s2` is the next input string, `a1` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in the newly input `s2`, `i` is incremented by 1, if `hd` > 0, then `hd` is decreased by 1, `res` is increased by 1.**
