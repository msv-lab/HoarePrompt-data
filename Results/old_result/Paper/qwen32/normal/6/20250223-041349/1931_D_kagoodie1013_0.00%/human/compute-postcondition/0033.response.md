The code snippet `mod_x_map = {}` reassigns `mod_x_map` to be an empty dictionary. This means that any previous contents of `mod_x_map` are discarded, and it now holds no key-value pairs.

Other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `count`, `mod_y_map`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with the frequency of each `mod_y_key` in `arr`. The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
