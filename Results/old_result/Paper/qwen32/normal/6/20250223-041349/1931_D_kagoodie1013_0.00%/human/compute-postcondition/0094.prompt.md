You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. Each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). Specifically, 1 <= len(test_cases) <= 10^4, 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each element a_i in the list a. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        mod_x_map = {}
        
        mod_y_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = -num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for each processed tuple; `count` is the final computed value after processing all elements in `arr` for each tuple; `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries that exist only within the scope of each iteration of the outer loop and are re-initialized for each tuple; `results` contains a count for each tuple processed, representing the total number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered for that specific tuple.
    return results
    #The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the final value of `count` for each processed tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` represents the total number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered for that specific tuple.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). The function processes each tuple to count the number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` that can be formed from the list `a`, where `mod_x` is the remainder of an element when divided by `x` and `mod_y` is the remainder when divided by `y`. The function returns a list `results` containing the count for each tuple in `test_cases`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `results`, which is a list containing the final value of `count` for each processed tuple in `test_cases`. Each `count` represents the total number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` encountered for that specific tuple.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
