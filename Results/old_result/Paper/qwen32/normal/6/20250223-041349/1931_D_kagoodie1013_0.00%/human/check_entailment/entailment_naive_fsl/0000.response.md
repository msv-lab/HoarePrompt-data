Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the number of beautiful pairs. Specifically, the way it counts pairs using the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries is flawed. Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Modulus Calculation for `mod_x`:**
   The line `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect. The condition for a pair `(i, j)` to be beautiful is that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. The correct modulus calculation for `mod_x` should be based on the sum of pairs, not the negative of individual elements. The correct approach is to track the frequency of sums modulo `x`.

2. **Incorrect Pair Counting Logic:**
   The line `count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` is incorrect. It attempts to count pairs based on individual elements' moduli, which does not correctly reflect the conditions for a pair to be beautiful. The correct approach should involve counting pairs where the sum of the elements is divisible by `x` and the difference is divisible by `y`.

3. **Incorrect Update of Modulus Maps:**
   The lines `mod_x_key = num % x` and `mod_y_key = num % y` are also incorrect for the same reasons as above. The correct approach should involve updating the frequency of sums modulo `x` and differences modulo `y`.

Here is a corrected version of the program to illustrate the correct approach:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))

results = []
for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_xy_map = {}
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                count += 1
    results.append(count)

print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
```

However, the above corrected version has a time complexity of O(n^2) which is not efficient given the constraints. The original program attempted to optimize this using hash maps, but the logic was incorrect. A correct and efficient solution would involve using hash maps to count the frequency of sums and differences modulo `x` and `y` respectively, but the logic in the original program is flawed.

Thus, the original program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the number of beautiful pairs, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
