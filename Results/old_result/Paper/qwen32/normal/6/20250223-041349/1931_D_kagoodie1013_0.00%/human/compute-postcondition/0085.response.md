The code snippet provided updates the value of `mod_x_key` to be `num % x`. This means that the variable `mod_x_key` now holds the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.

Here is the updated state:

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for the processed tuple; `count` is the previous value of `count` plus the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1`; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in the list `test_cases` to be processed, and `arr` must have at least two elements; `num` is the third element in `arr`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented by 1; `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1; `mod_x` is `-num % x`.** 

In simple terms, the variable `mod_x_key` has been updated to the value of `num % x`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
