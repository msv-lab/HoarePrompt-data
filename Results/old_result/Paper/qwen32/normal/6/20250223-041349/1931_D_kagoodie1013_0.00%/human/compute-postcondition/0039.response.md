The code snippet assigns the value of `num % x` to `mod_x_key`. Given that `mod_x` is already defined as `-num % x`, `mod_x_key` will now hold the value of `num % x`.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in `test_cases` and `arr` must have at least one element; `num` is the first element of `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`.**
