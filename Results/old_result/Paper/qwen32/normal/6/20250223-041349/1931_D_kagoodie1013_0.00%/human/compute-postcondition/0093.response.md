Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). The function processes each tuple to count the number of pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` that can be formed from the list `a`, where `mod_x` is the remainder of an element when divided by `x` and `mod_y` is the remainder when divided by `y`. The function returns a list `results` containing the count for each tuple in `test_cases`.**
