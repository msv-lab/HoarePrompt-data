Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the value of `count`; `count` is `count + mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to `mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1`; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in `test_cases` and `arr` must have at least two elements; `num` is the second element of `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `mod_x_key` is `num % x`; `mod_y_key` is `num % y`. The value of `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is incremented by 1.**

In simple terms, the value associated with `mod_x_key` in the `mod_x_map` dictionary is increased by 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
