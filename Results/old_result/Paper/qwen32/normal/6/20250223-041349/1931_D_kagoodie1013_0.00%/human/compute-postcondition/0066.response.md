The code snippet calculates the value of `mod_x` using the formula `-num % x`. Given that `num` is the first element in `arr` and `x` is a value from the current tuple, we can determine the value of `mod_x` based on these inputs.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for the processed tuple; `count` is 0; `mod_x_map` is an empty dictionary; `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the next tuple in the list `test_cases` to be processed, and `arr` must have at least one element; `num` is the first element in `arr`; `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

In simple terms, the value of `mod_x` is now calculated as `-num % x`, where `num` is the first element of the array `arr` from the current tuple in `test_cases`, and `x` is also from the current tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.
