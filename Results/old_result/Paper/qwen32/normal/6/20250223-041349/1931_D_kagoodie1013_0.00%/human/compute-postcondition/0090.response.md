The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the `results` list. This means that the `results` list now contains one more element, which is the value of `count` from the processed tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`. The values of `test_cases`, `count`, `mod_x_map`, and `mod_y_map` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` for the processed tuple plus the newly appended `count`; `count` is the final computed value after processing all elements in `arr`; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with counts of each `mod_x_key` encountered in `arr`; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with counts of each `mod_y_key` encountered in `arr`; The current tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` is the processed tuple.**
