The only objects in the loop head are the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` and the list `test_cases`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If there are more tuples in `test_cases`, the loop will execute again for the next tuple.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` contained at least one tuple, which was processed, and `results` now includes the final value of `count` for that tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still have at least one more tuple to process.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the next tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains n, x, y, and arr; `results` is a list containing the final value of count for the processed tuple; `count` is the total count as calculated by the loop for the processed tuple; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys as mod_x_key and values as their respective counts for the processed tuple; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys as mod_y_key and values as their respective counts for the processed tuple; The current tuple (n, x, y, arr) is the next tuple in the list `test_cases` to be processed.**
