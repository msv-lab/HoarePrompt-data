The given code snippet is:
```python
print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
```

Let's break down the components based on the initial state provided:

1. **`s`**: This is a non-empty string.
2. **`len(s) // 2`**: This expression calculates the integer division of the length of `s` by 2, which gives the midpoint of the string. If the length of `s` is odd, the midpoint will be the start of the second half of the string.
3. **`s[len(s) // 2:]`**: This slice takes the second half of the string `s` starting from the midpoint to the end.
4. **`s[:len(s) // 2]`**: This slice takes the first half of the string `s` from the start to the midpoint.
5. **`s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]`**: This concatenates the second half of the string with the first half of the string.

The `print` statement will output the result of this concatenation, which is essentially the string `s` rotated such that the second half comes before the first half.

Output: **newstr (where newstr is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`)**

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact value of `newstr`. However, we can describe it precisely based on the initial state.

Output: **newstr (where newstr is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`)**
