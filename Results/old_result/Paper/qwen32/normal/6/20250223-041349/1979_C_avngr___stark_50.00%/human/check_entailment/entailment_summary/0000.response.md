### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided program and verify if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have `n` outcomes, each with a multiplier `k_i`.
- We need to distribute coins `x_i` such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.
- Mathematically, the condition is: \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i\) for all \(i\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculating the Product:**
   - It calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`.

3. **Generating Bet Distribution:**
   - It generates a list `c` where each element `c_i = m / k_i`. This ensures that if the i-th outcome is winning, the return `k_i * c_i = m` which is greater than the total bet \(\sum c_i\).

4. **Simplifying the Bet Distribution:**
   - It calculates the GCD (`hcf`) of the list `c` to simplify the bet distribution.
   - It divides each `c_i` by the GCD to get the simplified bet distribution.

5. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - It checks if the total bet \(\sum c_i\) is less than `m / hcf`. If not, it outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the simplified bet distribution.

#### Verification:
- The program ensures that for each outcome, the return is strictly greater than the total bet by setting `c_i = m / k_i`.
- The simplification step ensures that the bet distribution is as small as possible while still satisfying the condition.
- The feasibility check ensures that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

#### Execution Summary Analysis:
- The execution summary seems to have a misunderstanding. The function `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers, which is used in the program to simplify the bet distribution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bet distribution and checks for feasibility. There are no apparent issues in the logic or implementation.

**Correctness: True**
