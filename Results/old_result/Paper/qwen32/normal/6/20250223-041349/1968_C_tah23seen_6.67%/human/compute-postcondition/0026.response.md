The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` modifies the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. Given the initial state where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1` and `i` is `0`, the value of `ans[1]` will be updated to `ans[1] + ans[0]`.

Output State: **`ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is `0`, `arr[1]` must be greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `ans[1] + ans[0]`**.

In natural language: The value of `ans[1]` is now the sum of its previous value and `ans[0]`. All other conditions and initial values remain unchanged.
