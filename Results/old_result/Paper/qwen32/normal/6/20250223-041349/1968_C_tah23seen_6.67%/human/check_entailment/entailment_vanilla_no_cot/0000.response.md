Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here are a few issues with the `func_1` function:

1. **Initialization of `ans[0]`**: The program initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`. However, `arr[0]` does not exist as the input array `arr` contains `x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n` and not `x_1`. The correct initialization of `ans[0]` should be any value greater than `x_2` (i.e., `arr[0]`), since `x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1`.

2. **Loop Range**: The loop `for i in range(n - 2)` is incorrect because it only iterates up to `n-3`, and the last element `ans[-1]` is set outside of the loop. This means the second last element `ans[-2]` is not correctly calculated in all cases.

3. **Condition and While Loop**: The condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]` and the subsequent while loop are not necessary and incorrectly handle the calculation of `ans[i + 1]`. Instead, `ans[i + 1]` should be set to `ans[i] + arr[i]` to ensure `arr[i] = ans[i+1] % ans[i]` holds.

4. **Final Element Calculation**: The final element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]` without ensuring that `arr[-1] = ans[-1] % ans[-2]` holds.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1  # a_1 can be any value greater than x_2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i]  # Ensure x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]  # Ensure x_n = a_n % a_{n-1}
    return ans
```

This corrected function initializes `ans[0]` to a value greater than `arr[0]` and iteratively calculates the rest of the `ans` array to satisfy the given conditions.
