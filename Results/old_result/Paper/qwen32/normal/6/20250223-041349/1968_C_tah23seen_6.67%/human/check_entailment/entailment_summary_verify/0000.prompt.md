You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function takes a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element `ans[0]` is one more than the first element of `arr`. Each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `1 <= i <= n-2`) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `arr[i-1]` that can be expressed as `arr[i-1] + k * ans[i-1]` for some positive integer `k`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
Given an array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \), find an array \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n \) such that:
1. \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \le i \le n \).
2. \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \).

### Provided Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n \). It then calls `func_1` to compute the array \( a \).

Let's break down the `func_1` function:
1. Initialize `ans` array with zeros.
2. Set `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`.
3. For each element from `i = 0` to `i = n-3`:
   - Set `ans[i+1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - If `ans[i+1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i+1]`, increment `ans[i+1]` by `ans[i]` until it exceeds `arr[i+1]`.
4. Set `ans[n-1]` to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-2]`.

### Verification
Let's verify if the provided code correctly handles the problem requirements for all potential cases.

#### Example Test Cases
1. **Input:**
   ```
   5
   4
   2 4 1
   3
   1 1
   6
   4 2 5 1 2
   2
   500
   3
   1 5
   ```

2. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   3 5 4 9
   2 5 11
   5 14 16 5 11 24
   501 500
   2 7 5
   ```

Let's analyze the provided code against these test cases.

#### Case 1: `4 2 4 1`
- `ans[0] = 3`
- `ans[1] = 2 + 3 = 5`
- `ans[2] = 4 + 5 = 9` (since 9 > 4, no adjustment needed)
- `ans[3] = 1 + 9 = 10` (since 10 > 1, no adjustment needed)

The output `3 5 9 10` does not match the provided output `3 5 4 9`. The code seems to have an issue with ensuring that `ans[i+1]` is correctly adjusted to satisfy the modulo condition.

#### Case 2: `3 1 1`
- `ans[0] = 2`
- `ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3`
- `ans[2] = 1 + 3 = 4` (since 4 > 1, no adjustment needed)

The output `2 3 4` does not match the provided output `2 5 11`. The code seems to have an issue with ensuring that `ans[i+1]` is correctly adjusted to satisfy the modulo condition.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly handle the problem requirements for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for adjusting `ans[i+1]` to ensure it satisfies the modulo condition is flawed.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

### Explanation
The code does not correctly adjust `ans[i+1]` to ensure it satisfies the modulo condition for all test cases. The logic for ensuring `ans[i+1]` is correctly adjusted needs to be revised.
