The code snippet `n = int(input())` reassigns the value of `n` to a new integer value obtained from the user input. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `n` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0 if the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` has ended or the length of the last sequence if it hasn't, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
