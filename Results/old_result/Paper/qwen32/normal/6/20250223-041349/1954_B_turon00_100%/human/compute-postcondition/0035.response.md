The code snippet `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. This change does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` equals 1 or `ans` equals `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
