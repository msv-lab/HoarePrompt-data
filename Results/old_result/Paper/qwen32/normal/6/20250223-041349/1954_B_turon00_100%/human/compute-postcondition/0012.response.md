The code snippet provided only resets the variable `cnt` to 0. None of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `ans`) are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**
