Postcondition: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is the input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is the length of the last contiguous sequence of elements equal to `tmp`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
