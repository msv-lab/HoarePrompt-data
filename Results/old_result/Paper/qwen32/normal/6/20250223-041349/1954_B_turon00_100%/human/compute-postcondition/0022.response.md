The code snippet sets the variable `cnt` to 0. This change does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, or the conditions related to `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `ans` is `min(n, 2)`. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
