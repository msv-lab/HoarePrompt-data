The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `n`. The current element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**
