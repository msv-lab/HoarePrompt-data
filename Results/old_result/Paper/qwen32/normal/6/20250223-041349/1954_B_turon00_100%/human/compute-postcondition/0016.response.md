The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given the initial state, `ans` is either `n` or `0` depending on whether `a[i]` is equal to `tmp` or not, and `cnt` is either `1` or `0`.

Here are the possible scenarios:
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is `1` and `ans` is `n`. After the execution of the code, `ans` will be `min(n, 1)`, which is `1`.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is `0` and `ans` is `0`. After the execution of the code, `ans` will be `min(0, 0)`, which is `0`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` will be either `0` or `1` based on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 1, else `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**.
