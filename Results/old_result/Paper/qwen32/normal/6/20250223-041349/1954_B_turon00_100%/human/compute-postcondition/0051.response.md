The code snippet `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The variables `n` and `i` (which is `i_new + 1`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i_new + 1`, `i` is `i_new + 1`, `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`**.
