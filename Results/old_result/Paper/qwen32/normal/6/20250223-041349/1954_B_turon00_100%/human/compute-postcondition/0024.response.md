To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop based on the given initial state and the states after the first 3 iterations.

Here's a summary of the loop's behavior for each iteration:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using the index `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
- It compares each element `a[i]` with the initial element `tmp` (which is `a[0]`).
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt` by 1.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, and then resets `cnt` to 0.

The loop continues these steps until it has processed all elements in the list `a`. After the loop finishes, `ans` will hold the minimum length of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` (the first element of `a`).

### Final Output State:
After the loop completes all its iterations, the final state of the variables will be:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is an input parameter not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `a`.
- `a` remains unchanged as the list is not modified within the loop.
- `tmp` remains `a[0]` as it is only set once at the start.
- `cnt` will be 0 if the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` has ended, or it will be the length of the last sequence if the list ends with elements equal to `tmp`.
- `ans` will be the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp`.

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop finishes executing, `ans` will contain the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to the first element `tmp`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp` will remain unchanged from their initial values. The variable `cnt` will be 0 if the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` has ended, or it will reflect the length of the last sequence if the list ends with elements equal to `tmp`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0 if the last sequence of elements equal to `tmp` has ended or the length of the last sequence if it hasn't, and `ans` is the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp`.**
