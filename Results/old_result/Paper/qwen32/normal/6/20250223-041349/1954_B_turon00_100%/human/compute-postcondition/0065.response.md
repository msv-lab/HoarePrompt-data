The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, or `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
