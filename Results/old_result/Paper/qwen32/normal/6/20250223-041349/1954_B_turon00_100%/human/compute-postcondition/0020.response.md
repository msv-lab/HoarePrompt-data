The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` can either be 2 or 0. If `cnt` is 2, it will become 3. If `cnt` is 0, it will become 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input where 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is `a[0]`, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is 3 and `ans` remains `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is 0.**
