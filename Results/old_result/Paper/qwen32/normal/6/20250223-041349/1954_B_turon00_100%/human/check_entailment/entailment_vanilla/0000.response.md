Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements.

The task is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array such that it stops being beautiful. If it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, the output should be -1.

The provided program iterates through the array and counts consecutive identical elements. It keeps track of the minimum length of such segments. If the array consists of only one element or if the entire array is one long segment of identical elements (i.e., `ans == n`), it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the shortest segment of identical elements.

Let's consider the logic:

1. **Initialization**: `tmp` is set to the first element of the array, and `cnt` is initialized to 0. `ans` is set to `n` (the length of the array).

2. **Iteration**: The program iterates through the array. If the current element is the same as `tmp`, it increments `cnt`. If the current element is different, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

3. **Final Check**: After the loop, it updates `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` (to account for the last segment).

4. **Output**: If the array has only one element (`n == 1`) or if the entire array is one segment of identical elements (`ans == n`), it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs `ans`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The program is trying to find the shortest segment of identical elements, but this does not necessarily translate to the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The correct approach would involve checking for the longest segment of identical elements and removing the rest, or finding a more optimal way to break the "beauty" condition.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The shortest segment is of length 1, but removing one element (e.g., the second `1`) would not make the array non-beautiful. Instead, removing one `2` would make the array `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
