Output State: **`t` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is the new input list of integers, `tmp` is `a[0]`, `cnt` is 2 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of `n` and `cnt`, and `i` is 2.**

In simple terms, the value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value (`n` if `a[i]` was equal to `tmp`, otherwise 0) and `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged.
