Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the transformation of the array as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for splitting numbers greater than or equal to 10 and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed. The program only performs a single pass over the array and splits the first number it encounters that is greater than the next number, but it does not continue to check if the resulting array can be sorted or if there are other numbers that need to be split. Additionally, the function `func_1` is called after only one potential transformation, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted through repeated applications of the operation.

Here's a brief explanation of the issues:
1. The loop only runs once, and only splits the first occurrence where the current number is greater than the next number and is greater than 10. It does not continue to check the rest of the array or repeat the process.
2. The transformation logic is not comprehensive. It only handles the first instance of a potential split and does not account for further splits that might be necessary.
3. The function `func_1` is called after a single transformation, which does not guarantee that the array is sorted or that further transformations are needed.

A correct solution would involve repeatedly checking and transforming the array until no more transformations are possible, and then checking if the array is sorted.
