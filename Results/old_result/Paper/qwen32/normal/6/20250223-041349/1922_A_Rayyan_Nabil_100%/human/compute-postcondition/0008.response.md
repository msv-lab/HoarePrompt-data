The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a throwaway variable and does not affect the logic of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is not used within the loop, it does not need to be adjusted. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20
- `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters
- `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1
- `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 0, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**
