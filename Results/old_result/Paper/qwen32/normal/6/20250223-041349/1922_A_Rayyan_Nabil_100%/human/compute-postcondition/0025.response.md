The loop head in the provided `for` loop statement is `result in results`. This means that the only state we can adjust is `result` and `results`. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20.
- `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
- `t` is an integer such that `t` > 0.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list.

To execute the loop one more time, `results` must have at least one more element because the loop iterates over `results`. Since `result` is the next element in the `results` list, for the loop to execute again, `result` should be the next element in the list, and `results` should have at least one more element.

However, since `results` already contains `t` elements, and we are at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `result` was the last element in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` should have `t+1` elements, and `result` should be the new last element in `results`.

State: **`n` is the input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20; `a` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters; `t` is an integer such that `t` > 0; `results` is a list containing `t+1` elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration; `result` is the next element in the `results` list.**
