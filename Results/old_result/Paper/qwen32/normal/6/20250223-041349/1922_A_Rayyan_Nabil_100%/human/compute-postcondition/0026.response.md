To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20.
2. `a` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
3. `b` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
4. `c` is a string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
5. `t` is an integer such that `t` > 0.
6. `results` is a list containing `t+1` elements, all of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
7. `result` is the next element in the `results` list.

### Analysis:
- The `results` list is populated with `t+1` elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.
- The variable `result` is defined as the "next element in the `results` list", but since `results` already contains `t+1` elements, `result` would be the last element of the `results` list (i.e., `results[t]`).

### What Will Be Printed:
- The `print(result)` statement will print the value of the last element in the `results` list.
- Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the last iteration, the output will be the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the last iteration.

### Final Output:
Output: **result (where result is the return value of func_1(n, a, b, c) for the last iteration)**
