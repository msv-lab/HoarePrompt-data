You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it meets the problem description.

The problem requires us to determine if there exists a template string `t` such that:
- Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
- String `c` does not match the template `t`.

The matching rules are:
- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then `s_i` must be the same as `t_i`.
- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then `s_i` must be different from the lowercase version of `t_i`.

The provided code checks if for each position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns "YES", indicating that a template exists that makes `a` and `b` match while `c` does not. Otherwise, it returns "NO".

Let's consider the correctness of this logic.

### Correctness Analysis

The code checks if there exists at least one position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it implies that we could construct a template where the i-th position is an uppercase letter corresponding to `c[i]` (so `c[i]` does not match, but `a[i]` and `b[i]` do). This seems to be the correct approach based on the problem description.

Let's look at the provided examples:
1. **First test case:**
   - `n = 1`
   - `a = 'a'`
   - `b = 'b'`
   - `c = 'c'`
   - Since `a[0] != c[0]` and `b[0] != c[0]`, the function returns "YES".

2. **Second test case:**
   - `n = 2`
   - `a = 'aa'`
   - `b = 'bb'`
   - `c = 'aa'`
   - There is no position `i` where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, so the function returns "NO".

3. **Third test case:**
   - `n = 10`
   - `a = 'mathforces'`
   - `b = 'luckforces'`
   - `c = 'adhoccoder'`
   - There are positions where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, so the function returns "YES".

4. **Fourth test case:**
   - `n = 3`
   - `a = 'acc'`
   - `b = 'abd'`
   - `c = 'abc'`
   - There is no position `i` where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`, so the function returns "NO".

The code seems to handle these examples correctly. Now let's consider if there could be any edge cases that the code might miss.

### Edge Cases

- **All characters in `a` and `b` are the same and different from `c`:**
  - For example, `a = 'aaa'`, `b = 'aaa'`, `c = 'bbb'`.
  - The function will return "YES" because `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i`.

- **All characters in `a` and `b` are different from `c`:**
  - For example, `a = 'abc'`, `b = 'def'`, `c = 'ghi'`.
  - The function will return "YES" because `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i`.

- **All characters in `a` and `b` are the same and the same as `c`:**
  - For example, `a = 'aaa'`, `b = 'aaa'`, `c = 'aaa'`.
  - The function will return "NO" because there is no position `i` where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]`.

- **All characters in `a` and `b` are different and one character in `a` or `b` matches `c`:**
  - For example, `a = 'abc'`, `b = 'def'`, `c = 'abe'`.
  - The function will return "NO" because there is no position `i` where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i`.

After considering these cases, it seems that the code correctly handles all edge cases and meets the problem description.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided code is correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly checks if there exists at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, which implies that a template exists that makes `a` and `b` match while `c` does not. The provided examples and edge cases are handled correctly.
