The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop condition, the only variable that needs adjustment is `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, ensuring that `t` remains greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`**
