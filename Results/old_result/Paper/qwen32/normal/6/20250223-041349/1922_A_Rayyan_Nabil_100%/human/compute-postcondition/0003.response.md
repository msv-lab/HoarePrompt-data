The code snippet `n = int(input().strip())` reads an input value, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given that the initial state specifies `n` is already a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, the execution of this code will overwrite the initial value of `n` with the new input value. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20 (as per the new input), `a`, `b`, `c` are strings each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `results` is an empty list**.
