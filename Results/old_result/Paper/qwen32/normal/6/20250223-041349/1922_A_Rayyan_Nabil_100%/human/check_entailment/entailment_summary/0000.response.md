### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the given functions to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
  - Strings `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
  - String `c` does not match the template `t`.

#### Conditions for Matching:
- If the i-th character of `t` is lowercase, the i-th character of the string must be the same as the i-th character of `t`.
- If the i-th character of `t` is uppercase, the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th character of `t`.

#### Approach:
- For each position `i` in the strings, we need to check:
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` can be made to match a template character `t[i]`.
  - If `c[i]` cannot match the same template character `t[i]`.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` checks if there is at least one position `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
- If such a position exists, it means we can create a template character `t[i]` (either uppercase or lowercase) that matches `a[i]` and `b[i]` but does not match `c[i]`.
- If no such position exists, it means for every position, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is the same as `c[i]`, making it impossible to create a template that satisfies the conditions.

This approach correctly identifies whether a suitable template exists based on the problem's requirements.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` handles input reading and output printing for multiple test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This function correctly manages multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to determine the output for each one.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. `func_1` checks the necessary condition for the existence of a suitable template, and `func_2` manages the input and output for multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.
