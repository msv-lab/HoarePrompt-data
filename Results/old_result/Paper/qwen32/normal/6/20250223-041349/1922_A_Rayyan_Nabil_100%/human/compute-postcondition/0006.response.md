The code snippet `c = input().strip()` updates the variable `c` with a new value, which is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a` is the input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `b` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `c` is the newly input string consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` is an integer such that `t` >= 1, `results` is an empty list.**
