To determine the output of the `print(result)` statement, we need to understand the context and the variables involved:

1. **`n`**: This is an integer input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
2. **`a`**: This is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
3. **`b`**: This is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
4. **`c`**: This is a string of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
5. **`t`**: This is an integer such that \(t > 0\).
6. **`results`**: This is a list containing `t` elements. Each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
7. **`result`**: This is the next element in the `results` list.

The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`, which is the next element in the `results` list. Since `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, a, b, c)`, the exact value of `result` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.

However, given the initial state, we do not have the definition or implementation of `func_1(n, a, b, c)`. Therefore, we can only describe `result` in terms of the function's return value.

Output: **result (where result is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the current iteration)**
