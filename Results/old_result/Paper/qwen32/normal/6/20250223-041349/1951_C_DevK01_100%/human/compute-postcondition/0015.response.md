The code snippet `cost = mu * w` calculates the value of `cost` by multiplying `mu` with `w`. The values of `mu` and `w` are already defined in the initial state.

- `mu` is defined as `k - (n - 1) * m`.
- `w` is defined as `M[q-1]`.

These values do not change after the code snippet is executed. The only new variable introduced is `cost`, which is the product of `mu` and `w`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers; `M` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is the length of `M[:q-1]`; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**
