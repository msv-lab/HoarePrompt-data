You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased each day (`m`), the total number of tickets to be bought (`k`), and a list of prices for each day. It calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided Python program and see if it correctly solves the problem described.

#### Problem Recap:
- We need to buy `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, the price per ticket is given by `a_i`.
- We can buy up to `m` tickets per day.
- Buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price per ticket by `x` for all subsequent days.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of prices `a`.

2. **Constraints Adjustment:**
   - `m` is adjusted to be the minimum of `m` and `k` because we cannot buy more tickets than needed.

3. **Sorting Prices:**
   - Prices are sorted in ascending order to buy the cheapest tickets first.

4. **Calculating Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - `q` is the number of days needed to buy `k` tickets, rounded up (using `math.ceil(k / m)`).

5. **Selecting Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the `q` cheapest days from the sorted list of prices.

6. **Calculating Cost:**
   - If the total number of tickets bought in `q` days is exactly `k`, the cost is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{cost} = m \times \sum_{i=1}^{q} N[i] + m \times m \times \frac{(q - 1) \times q}{2}
     \]
     where `N` is the list of selected prices.
   - If the total number of tickets bought in `q` days exceeds `k`, the cost is adjusted:
     - The last selected price `w` is removed.
     - The number of tickets bought on the last day is adjusted to `mu = k - (q - 1) \times m`.
     - The cost is recalculated considering the adjusted number of tickets on the last day.

#### Issues in the Program:
- The program does not correctly account for the price increase mechanism.
- The cost calculation does not properly reflect the price increases due to previous purchases.
- The logic for selecting and adjusting the number of tickets on the last day is flawed.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, a greedy approach with a priority queue (min-heap) is more appropriate:
1. Use a priority queue to always buy tickets on the cheapest available day.
2. Keep track of the cumulative price increase.
3. Adjust the number of tickets bought each day based on the remaining tickets needed and the daily limit `m`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
