The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common placeholder indicating that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. Since `_` does not affect the logic of the loop, the state of `_` does not need to be adjusted. However, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 at the end of the previous iteration, to execute the loop one more time, `t` should be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `L` is a list of integers; `M` is a sorted list of integers; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
