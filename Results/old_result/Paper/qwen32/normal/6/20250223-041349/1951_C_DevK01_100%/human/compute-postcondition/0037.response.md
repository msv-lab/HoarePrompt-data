To determine the output of the `print(cost)` statement, let's break down the calculations step-by-step based on the provided initial state and the definitions of the variables.

1. **Initialization and Input:**
   - `t`: Must be greater than or equal to 0 (though `t` is not directly used in the calculations leading to `cost`).
   - `L`: A list of integers read from the input.
   - `M`: A new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order.

2. **Variable Definitions:**
   - `m`: The minimum of the second and third elements of `L` (`min(L[1], L[2])`).
   - `k`: The third element of `L` (`L[2]`).
   - `q`: The ceiling of `k / m` (`int(math.ceil(k / m))`).
   - `N`: A slice of `M` up to `q` elements. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]`. Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed.
   - `w`: The `q-1`th element of `M` if `n * m == k`. Otherwise, `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop.
   - `mu`: The result of `k - (n - 1) * m`.
   - `n`: The length of `N`.
   - `cost`: Calculated differently based on whether `n * m == k`:
     - If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - Otherwise, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

3. **Calculation of `cost`:**
   - `m` and `k` are directly derived from `L`.
   - `q` is derived from `k` and `m`.
   - `N` is derived from `M` and `q`.
   - `w` is derived from `N` and `q`.
   - `mu` is derived from `k`, `n`, and `m`.
   - `n` is the length of `N`.
   - `cost` is calculated using the formulas provided.

Given the complexity and the dependency on the values of `L` and `M`, which are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the `cost` in terms of these variables.

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the provided formulas and the values of L and M)**

To be more specific:
- If `n * m == k`, then `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- Otherwise, `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

Where:
- `m = min(L[1], L[2])`
- `k = L[2]`
- `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`
- `N = M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N = M[:q]` with the last element removed
- `w = M[q-1]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop
- `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`
- `n = len(N)`

So, the final output in the required format is:

Output: **cost (where cost is calculated based on the provided formulas and the values of L and M)**
