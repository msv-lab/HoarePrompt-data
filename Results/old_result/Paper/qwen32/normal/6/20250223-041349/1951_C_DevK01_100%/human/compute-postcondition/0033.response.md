Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `L` is a new list of integers read from the input; `M` is the new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `n` is the length of `N` minus one; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `mu * w`.**

In this output state, the value of `cost` has been recalculated based on the new values of `mu` and `w`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
