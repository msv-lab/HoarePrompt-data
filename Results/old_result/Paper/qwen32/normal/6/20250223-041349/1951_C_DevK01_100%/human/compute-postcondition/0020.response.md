The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, in the given context, there is no loop to continue from. Therefore, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state of the program.

Since there is no change in the variables or the state due to the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers; `M` is a sorted list of integers; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
