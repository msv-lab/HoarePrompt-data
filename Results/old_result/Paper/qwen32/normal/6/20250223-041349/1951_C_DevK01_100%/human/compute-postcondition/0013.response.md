The code `w = N.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the list `N`. Given that `N` is `M[:q]`, the last element of `N` is `M[q-1]`. After this operation, `N` will be `M[:q-1]`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers; `M` is a sorted list of integers; `n` is the length of `M[:q]` (previously `q`, now `q-1`); `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))` (unchanged); `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`. Additionally, `n * m` is not equal to `k` (unchanged).**
