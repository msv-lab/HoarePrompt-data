The code snippet `n = len(N)` updates the value of `n` to be the length of the list `N`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]`; `w` is `M[q-1]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
