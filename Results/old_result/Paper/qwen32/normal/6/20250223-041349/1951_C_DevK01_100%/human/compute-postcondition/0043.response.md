Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a new list of integers read from the input; `n` is `L[0]`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is `M[q-1]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**

In simpler terms, the value of `m` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
