Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ min(`n`*`m`, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets that can be purchased each day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively. The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`, where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days. The total number of test cases, `t`, satisfies 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    M = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
    m = min(m, k)
    M.sort()
    q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
    N = M[:q]
    n = len(N)
    if n * m == k:
        cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
    else:
        w = N.pop()
        mu = k - (n - 1) * m
        cost = mu * w
        n = len(N)
        cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
    print(cost)
    continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers; `M` is a sorted list of integers; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. Otherwise, `N` is `M[:q-1]`; `w` is `M[q-1]`; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; and `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than or equal to 0; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `m` is `min(L[1], L[2])`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is `M[q-1]` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `n` is the length of `N`; `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`. If `n * m == k`, then `N` is `M[:q]` and `w` is `M[q-1]`; otherwise, `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed and `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop. `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`. `cost` is `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` if `n * m == k`, otherwise `cost` is updated to `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
