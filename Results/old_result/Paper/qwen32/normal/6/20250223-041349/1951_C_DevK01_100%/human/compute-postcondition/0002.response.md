The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `L`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
