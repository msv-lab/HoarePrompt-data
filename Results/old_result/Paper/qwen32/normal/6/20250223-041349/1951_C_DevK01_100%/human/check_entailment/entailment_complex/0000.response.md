### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem requirements and the provided example to determine its correctness.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Sorting Prices**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices. This is a reasonable approach to minimize the cost, as buying tickets on the days with the lowest prices first will generally yield the lowest total cost.
2. **Calculating the Number of Days to Purchase Tickets (`q`)**: The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k/m`, which represents the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, considering the limit `m` tickets per day.
3. **Handling Full Days and Remaining Tickets**:
    - If `n * m == k`, it means that tickets can be bought in full days without any leftover tickets, so the cost is calculated accordingly.
    - If there are leftover tickets (i.e., `n * m > k`), the program calculates the cost for the remaining tickets separately and adds it to the total cost.
4. **Cost Calculation**:
    - The cost is calculated by summing the prices of the tickets bought on the cheapest days, taking into account the increasing prices due to previous purchases.

#### Analysis with Example:

Let's analyze the first test case from the example provided:

**Input:**
```
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
10
```

**Program Execution:**
1. **Sorting Prices**: The prices `[8, 6, 4, 2]` are sorted to `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
2. **Calculating `q`**: `q = ceil(3/2) = 2`.
3. **Selecting Days to Purchase**: The first 2 days with the lowest prices are selected: `[2, 4]`.
4. **Cost Calculation**:
    - Since `2 * 2 < 3`, there is a need to buy 1 ticket on the third day.
    - The cost for the first 2 days is `2 * (2 + 4) = 12`.
    - The cost for the third day is `1 * 6 = 6`.
    - However, the prices increase after each purchase, so the actual cost calculation should account for this:
        - Buy 2 tickets on the first day at price `2 + 0 = 2` each, total `4`, and prices become `[4, 6, 8]`.
        - Buy 1 ticket on the third day at price `4 + 2 = 6`, total `6`.
        - Total cost: `4 + 6 = 10`.

The program seems to be correctly calculating the cost based on the given constraints and the example provided.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implementing the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase `k` tickets given the constraints. The example provided matches the expected output, and the logic aligns with the problem description.

**Correctness: **True**
