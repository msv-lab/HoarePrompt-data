The provided code modifies the `cost` variable by adding a calculated value to it. Here's the updated value of `cost`:

The new value of `cost` is calculated as:
\[ \text{cost} = \text{cost} + m \times \sum(N) + m \times m \times \left(\frac{(n - 1) \times n}{2}\right) + n \times m \times \mu \]

Given the initial state, the variables `t`, `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, and `mu` remain unchanged except for `cost`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `L` is a list of integers read from the input; `M` is a new list of integers read from the input, sorted in ascending order; `n` is `len(N)`; `m` is `min(m, k)`; `k` is `L[2]`; `q` is `int(math.ceil(k / m))`; `N` is `M[:q]` with the last element removed; `w` is the last element of `N` before the pop; `mu` is `k - (n - 1) * m`; `cost` is updated to `cost + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`.**
