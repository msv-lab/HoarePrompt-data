The given initial state describes several variables and their roles, but the `print('Alice')` statement does not depend on any of these variables (`T`, `i`, `a`, `b`). The `print` statement directly outputs the string `'Alice'`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is straightforward and outputs the string `'Alice'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is simply the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
