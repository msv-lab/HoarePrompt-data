Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then determines and prints the winner based on specific conditions: if `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is 1, it prints 'Alice'; if `b` is 1, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.**
