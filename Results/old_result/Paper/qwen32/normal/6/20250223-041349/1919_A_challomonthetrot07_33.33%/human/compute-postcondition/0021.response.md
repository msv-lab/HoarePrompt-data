Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet:

**Initial State:**
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `a` is not equal to 1.
- `b` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is an even integer.
- Either `a` is not even or `b` is not odd. (This condition is somewhat redundant since `a` is already specified to be even, so this part doesn't affect `a` but could affect `b`).
- `a` is not greater than `b`.

**Python Code Snippet:**
```python
print('Alice')
```

**Analysis:**
The `print('Alice')` statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string 'Alice'.

**Output:**
Output: **Alice**
