You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())

    #State: The loop has executed `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the values of `a` and `b` are read from the input and a winner is determined based on the given conditions. The values of `a` and `b` are not altered after each iteration; they are only used to print the result ('Alice' or 'Bob'). The variable `i` ranges from 0 to `T-1` as the loop iterates through each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then determines and prints the winner based on specific conditions: if `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is 1, it prints 'Alice'; if `b` is 1, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided problem description and examples.

### Problem Analysis

The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns performing two actions:
1. Swap wallets or keep their current wallets.
2. Remove one coin from the current wallet.

The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., when both wallets are empty) loses.

### Key Observations

1. **Equal Coins (a == b):**
   - If both players have the same number of coins, then Bob will always win if both play optimally. This is because Alice will always be the one to make the last move when both wallets are empty.
   
2. **One Coin (a == 1 or b == 1):**
   - If Alice starts with 1 coin, she will lose because Bob can always keep his wallet and take his coin, leaving Alice with no coins.
   - If Bob starts with 1 coin, Alice can always swap wallets and take her coin, leaving Bob with no coins.

3. **Odd vs Even Coins:**
   - If Alice starts with an odd number of coins, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will always be the one to make the last move when both wallets are empty.
   - If Alice starts with an even number of coins and Bob starts with an odd number, Alice will always win. This is because Bob will be forced into a position where he has to make the last move when both wallets are empty.

4. **General Case (a > b or a < b):**
   - If Alice has more coins than Bob and the number of coins in Alice's wallet is even, Alice will always win. This is because she can always force Bob into a position where he has to make the last move.
   - If Bob has more coins than Alice and the number of coins in Alice's wallet is even, Bob will always win. This is because he can always force Alice into a position where she has to make the last move.

### Program Analysis

Let's examine the logic in the provided program:

1. **Equal Coins (a == b):**
   - The program correctly returns 'Bob' when `a == b`.

2. **One Coin (a == 1 or b == 1):**
   - The program correctly returns 'Alice' when `a == 1` and 'Bob' when `b == 1`.

3. **Odd vs Even Coins:**
   - The program correctly returns 'Bob' when `a % 2 == 1` (Alice has an odd number of coins).
   - The program correctly returns 'Alice' when `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1` (Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number).

4. **General Case (a > b or a < b):**
   - The program incorrectly returns 'Bob' when `a > b`. This is not always correct. If `a` is even, Alice should win.
   - The program incorrectly returns 'Alice' when `a < b`. This is not always correct. If `a` is even, Bob should win.

### Conclusion

The program contains logical errors in handling the general cases where `a > b` and `a < b`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
