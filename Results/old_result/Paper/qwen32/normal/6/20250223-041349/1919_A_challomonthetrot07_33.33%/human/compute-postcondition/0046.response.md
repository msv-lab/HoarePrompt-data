The initial state describes several variables (`T`, `i`, `a`, `b`) and their properties, but the `print` statement in the code snippet does not depend on these variables. It simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
- The `print` statement is `print('Alice')`.

Since the `print` statement is hardcoded to output the string `'Alice'`, the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` do not influence the output.

Output: **Alice**
