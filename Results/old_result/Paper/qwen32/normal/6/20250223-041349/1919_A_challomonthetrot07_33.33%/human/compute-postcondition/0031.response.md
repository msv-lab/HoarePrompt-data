The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print('Alice')
```

The `print` statement outputs the string 'Alice' directly. The initial state describes several variables (`T`, `i`, `a`, `b`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The variable `T` represents the number of test cases.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 1.
3. The variables `a` and `b` are integers read from the input.
4. The `print` statement outputs the string 'Alice' without referencing any of the variables.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, or `b`, the output is simply the string 'Alice'.

Output: **Alice**
