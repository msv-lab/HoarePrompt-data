Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `i` is 1; `a` and `b` are the integers read from the input. If `a` == 1, or if `b` == 1, or if `b` != 1 and `a` is odd, or if `b` != 1 and `a` is even and `b` is odd, the behavior is as described in the if part. In all other cases, the values of `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**
