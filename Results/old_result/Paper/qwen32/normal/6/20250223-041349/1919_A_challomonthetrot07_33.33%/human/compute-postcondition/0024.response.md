Postcondition: **T is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; i is 0; a and b are integers read from the input, a is not equal to b, a is not equal to 1, and b is not equal to 1. If a is an odd integer, then a is odd. If a is an even integer, then a is even. If a is even and b is odd, then a remains even and b remains odd. If a is greater than b, then a is greater than b; otherwise, a is not greater than b.**
