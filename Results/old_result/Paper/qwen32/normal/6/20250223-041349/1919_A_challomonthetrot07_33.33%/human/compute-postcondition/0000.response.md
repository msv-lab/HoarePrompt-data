The initial state sets up the function to receive an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. The code snippet provided reads an integer input and assigns it to `T`. This means `T` now holds the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases.

Output State: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000.**
