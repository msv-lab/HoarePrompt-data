The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'Bob'. The initial state describes several variables (`T`, `i`, `a`, `b`), but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output will be the string 'Bob' as specified.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The `print('Bob')` statement is executed.
2. The string 'Bob' is directly printed to the output.
3. None of the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, `b` are referenced in this statement, so their values do not affect the output.

Output: **Bob**
