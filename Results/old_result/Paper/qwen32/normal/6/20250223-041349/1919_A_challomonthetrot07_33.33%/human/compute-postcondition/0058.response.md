Output State: **The loop has executed `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the values of `a` and `b` are read from the input and a winner is determined based on the given conditions. The values of `a` and `b` are not altered after each iteration; they are only used to print the result ('Alice' or 'Bob'). The variable `i` ranges from 0 to `T-1` as the loop iterates through each test case.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, the loop has processed all `T` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, checks the specified conditions, and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on those conditions. The values of `a` and `b` are not changed after being read and used for the output. The loop index `i` will have completed its range from 0 to `T-1`.
