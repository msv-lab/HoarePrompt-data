The given code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Bob'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `T`, `i`, `a`, and `b`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely dependent on the string provided within it.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` statement is `print('Bob')`.
2. The string `'Bob'` is explicitly provided within the `print` statement.
3. No variables or conditions from the initial state affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Thus, the output will be the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
