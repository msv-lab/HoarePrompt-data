Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input, and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is 1, no changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a` is not equal to 1, `b` is not equal to 1, and the parity of `a` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` remains greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` is not greater than `b`.**
