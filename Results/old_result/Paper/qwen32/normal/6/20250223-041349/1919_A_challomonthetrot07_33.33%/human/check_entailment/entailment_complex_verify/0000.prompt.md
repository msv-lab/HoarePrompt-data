You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

    #State: The loop has executed `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the values of `a` and `b` are read from the input and a winner is determined based on the given conditions. The values of `a` and `b` are not altered after each iteration; they are only used to print the result ('Alice' or 'Bob'). The variable `i` ranges from 0 to `T-1` as the loop iterates through each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then determines and prints the winner based on specific conditions: if `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is 1, it prints 'Alice'; if `b` is 1, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the game described. Let's analyze the logic and identify a few issues:

1. **Case when `a == b`**:
   - The program correctly states that "Bob" wins when `a == b`. This is because both players will always end up in a situation where they cannot make a move after alternating turns.

2. **Case when `a == 1`**:
   - The program correctly states that "Alice" wins when `a == 1` and `b > 1`. Alice can swap with Bob, reducing Bob's coins to 0, and then Bob loses on his turn.

3. **Case when `b == 1`**:
   - The program correctly states that "Bob" wins when `b == 1` and `a > 1`. Bob can swap with Alice, reducing Alice's coins to 0, and then Alice loses on her turn.

4. **Case when `a % 2 == 1`**:
   - The program incorrectly states that "Bob" wins when `a % 2 == 1`. This is not universally true. For example, if `a = 3` and `b = 2`, Alice can swap with Bob, making `a = 2` and `b = 3`. Now, Bob can swap with Alice, making `a = 3` and `b = 2`. Alice can then swap again, making `a = 2` and `b = 3`. This continues until `a = 1` and `b = 2`, at which point Alice can swap and win.

5. **Case when `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**:
   - The program incorrectly states that "Alice" wins when `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`. This is not universally true. For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 3`, Alice can swap with Bob, making `a = 3` and `b = 2`. Now, Bob can swap with Alice, making `a = 2` and `b = 3`. This continues until `a = 1` and `b = 2`, at which point Alice can swap and win. However, if `a = 4` and `b = 3`, Alice can swap with Bob, making `a = 3` and `b = 4`. Now, Bob can swap with Alice, making `a = 4` and `b = 3`. This continues until `a = 2` and `b = 3`, at which point Alice can swap and win. But this is not always the case. Consider `a = 4` and `b = 5`, Alice will lose if both play optimally.

6. **Case when `a > b`**:
   - The program incorrectly states that "Bob" wins when `a > b`. This is not universally true. For example, if `a = 5` and `b = 3`, Alice can swap with Bob, making `a = 3` and `b = 5`. Now, Bob can swap with Alice, making `a = 5` and `b = 3`. This continues until `a = 3` and `b = 5`, at which point Alice can swap and win.

7. **Case when `a < b`**:
   - The program incorrectly states that "Alice" wins when `a < b`. This is not universally true for the same reasons as above.

The logic in the provided program is flawed and does not correctly determine the winner for all cases. The correct approach involves analyzing the parity (odd/even nature) of `a` and `b` more carefully, especially when both are greater than 1 and not equal. A correct solution would involve more sophisticated logic to handle all edge cases.

For example, a correct solution might involve the following logic:
- If `a == b`, Bob wins.
- If `a == 1`, Alice wins if `b > 1`.
- If `b == 1`, Bob wins if `a > 1`.
- If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, the winner depends on the parity of `a` and `b`:
  - If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob wins.
  - If both `a` and `b` are even, Alice wins.
  - If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Alice wins.
  - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Bob wins.

Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
