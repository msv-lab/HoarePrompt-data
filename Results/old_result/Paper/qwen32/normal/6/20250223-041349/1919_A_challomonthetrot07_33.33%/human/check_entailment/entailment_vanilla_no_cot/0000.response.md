Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem based on the provided description.

The game rules and the optimal strategy can be summarized as follows:

1. Alice and Bob take turns playing.
2. In each turn, a player can choose to swap wallets or not.
3. A player must then remove one coin from their current wallet.
4. The player who cannot make a move loses.

The key points to determine the winner are:
- If both wallets have the same number of coins, Bob wins because Alice will always be the one to face the situation where both wallets are empty.
- If either wallet has exactly one coin, the player with the single coin will lose because they can only remove that coin and leave the opponent with a non-empty wallet.
- If Alice starts with an odd number of coins and Bob with an even number, Bob wins because Alice will always be forced into a losing position.
- If Alice starts with an even number of coins and Bob with an odd number, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.
- If Alice has more coins than Bob and both have even numbers of coins, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves.
- If Alice has fewer coins than Bob and both have even numbers of coins, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.

Let's analyze the given program's logic:
- If `a == b`, it correctly prints 'Bob'.
- If `a == 1`, it correctly prints 'Alice'.
- If `b == 1`, it correctly prints 'Bob'.
- If `a % 2 == 1`, it prints 'Bob'. This is correct for the case where Alice starts with an odd number of coins and Bob with an even number.
- If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`, it prints 'Alice'. This is correct for the case where Alice starts with an even number of coins and Bob with an odd number.
- The conditions `elif a > b: print('Bob')` and `else: print('Alice')` are incorrect. They do not consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the numbers, which is crucial for determining the winner.

The program does not correctly handle all cases involving even numbers of coins and the relative sizes of `a` and `b`. Specifically, the logic for when both `a` and `b` are even is incorrect.

Thus, the program is not correct for all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
