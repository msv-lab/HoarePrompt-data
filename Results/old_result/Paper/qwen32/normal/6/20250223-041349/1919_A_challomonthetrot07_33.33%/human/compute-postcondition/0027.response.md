Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `a` and `b` are integers read from the input. If `a` is equal to `b`, no changes are made to `a` or `b`. If `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` and `b` retain their original values unless `a` is not equal to 1 and `b` is not equal to 1, in which case the parity of `a` remains unchanged, and if `a` was greater than `b`, `a` remains greater than `b`; otherwise, `a` is not greater than `b`.**
