Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`). If `k` is 0, no changes are made to `a[r]`, `sunks`, or `l`, and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions and changes specified in the precondition may apply depending on the values of `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and `k`.**
