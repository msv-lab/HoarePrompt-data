Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `a[l] <= a[r]`, then if `k` >= `a[l] * 2`, `k` is reduced by `a[l] * 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, `l` is incremented by 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. If `a[l] > a[r]`, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.**
