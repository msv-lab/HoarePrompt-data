The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `sunks` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` - 1, and `sunks` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` - 1, `sunks` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1.**
