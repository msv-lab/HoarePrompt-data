The value of `a[l]` is decreased by the value of `a[r]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged unless `k` is 0, which is not specified in the given code snippet, so we assume `k` remains as `k - a[r] * 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` and each integer `a_i` (except `a[l]`) satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`), `sunks` remains unchanged.**
