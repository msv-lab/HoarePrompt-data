Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simpler terms: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain the same. If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes occur, and the loop or if statement is exited.
