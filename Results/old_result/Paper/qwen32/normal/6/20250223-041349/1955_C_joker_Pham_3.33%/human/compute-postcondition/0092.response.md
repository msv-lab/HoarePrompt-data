Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is initially greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2`, then `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]`, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, and `sunks` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain as per the initial conditions or `sunks` remains unchanged if `k` is 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
