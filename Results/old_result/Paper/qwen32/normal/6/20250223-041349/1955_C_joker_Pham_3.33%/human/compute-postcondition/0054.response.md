Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`). If `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `k` is updated to `k - a[r] * 2`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - a[r]` (or 0 if `a[l]` was originally 0), `sunks` is incremented by 1, and `l` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` was 0. If `k < a[r] * 2`, then if `k == a[r] * 2 - 1`, `sunks` is incremented by 1 and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `k` is not 0, no changes are made to `a[r]`, `sunks`, or `l`, and the code execution continues. If `k` is 0, no changes are made to `a[r]`, `sunks`, or `l`, and the code execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
