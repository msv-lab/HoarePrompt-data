Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. If `k` >= `a[r] * 2`, then `sunks` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, and `l` is less than or equal to `r` - 1. If `k` < `a[r] * 2`, then if `a[r] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and in both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
