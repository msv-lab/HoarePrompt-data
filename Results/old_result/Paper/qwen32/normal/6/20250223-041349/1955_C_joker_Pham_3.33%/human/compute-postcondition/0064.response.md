Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0 minus `a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`). If `l` equals `r`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**

In simpler terms, the value of `k` is reduced by `2 * a[l]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
