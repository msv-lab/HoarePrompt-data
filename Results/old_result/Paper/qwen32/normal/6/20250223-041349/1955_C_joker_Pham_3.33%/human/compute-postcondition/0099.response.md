Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15 or `k` is 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `k` is not 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1.**
