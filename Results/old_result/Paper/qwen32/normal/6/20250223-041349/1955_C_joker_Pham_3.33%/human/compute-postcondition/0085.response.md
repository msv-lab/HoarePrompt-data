Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is `k - a[r] * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is now `a[l] - a[r]` and each integer `a_i` (except `a[l]`) satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`), `sunks` is incremented by 1.**

Natural language explanation: The value of `sunks` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per their initial state descriptions.
