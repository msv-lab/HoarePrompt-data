Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `k` is equal to 0. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `l` is equal to or less than `r` (with `r` being `n - 1`). If `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `k` being 0 does not satisfy `k` greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, then no changes are made to `a[r]`, `sunks`, or `l`. If `a[l]` is greater than `a[r]`, no changes are made to `a[r]`, `sunks`, or `l`. The value of `k` being 0 does not affect `a[r]`, `sunks`, or `l` unless additional conditions are met outside the scope of this if statement.**
