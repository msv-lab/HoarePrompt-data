The code snippet provided reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. Given the initial state, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` were integers with specific constraints. After the execution of the code, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will be updated to the values read from the input.

Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers read from the input, with the constraints 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.**
