To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the expressions involved.

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`t` is `t - 1`**: This indicates that `t` is being decremented by 1. However, the exact value of `t` is not provided, so we cannot determine its value precisely. This operation does not affect the print statement directly.

2. **`k` is the last element of the iterable returned by `R()`**: The exact value of `k` depends on the implementation of `R()`. However, we know that `k` is an integer.

3. **`a` is a set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`**: The set `a` contains elements from the iterable returned by `R()`. The exact elements are not provided.

4. **`b` is a new set of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`**: Similar to `a`, the set `b` contains elements from the iterable returned by `R()`. The exact elements are not provided.

5. **`f` is `1` if `u | v` is `True` for all iterations else `0`**: The variable `f` is a boolean flag (represented as `1` or `0`). It is set to `1` if `u | v` is `True` for all iterations, otherwise it is `0`. The variables `u` and `v` are not defined in the initial state, but we can infer that `f` is either `1` or `0`.

6. **`m` is `k // 2` minus the number of iterations where `u` is `True` and `v` is `False`**: The variable `m` is calculated based on `k` and the number of iterations where `u` is `True` and `v` is `False`. The exact value of `m` depends on these conditions.

7. **`n` is `k // 2` minus the number of iterations where `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`**: Similarly, `n` is calculated based on `k` and the number of iterations where `u` is `False` and `v` is `True`. The exact value of `n` depends on these conditions.

### Analysis of the Print Statement

The print statement is:
```python
print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
```

Let's break down the expression inside the brackets:

1. **`f ^ 1`**: This is a bitwise XOR operation between `f` and `1`. If `f` is `0`, `f ^ 1` is `1`. If `f` is `1`, `f ^ 1` is `0`.

2. **`m | n < 0`**: This expression is evaluated as `(m | n) < 0`. The bitwise OR operation `m | n` is performed first, and then the result is checked to see if it is less than `0`. If `m | n` is less than `0`, the expression evaluates to `True` (which is `1` in a boolean context). Otherwise, it evaluates to `False` (which is `0` in a boolean context).

3. **`f ^ 1 or m | n < 0`**: This is a logical OR operation. If `f ^ 1` is `True` (i.e., `1`), the expression evaluates to `1`. If `f ^ 1` is `False` (i.e., `0`), the expression evaluates to the result of `m | n < 0`.

4. **`[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`**: This is a slice of the string `'YNEOS'`. The starting index of the slice is determined by the result of `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0`, and the step is `2`.

### Possible Values

- If `f` is `0`:
  - `f ^ 1` is `1`.
  - The starting index is `1`.
  - The slice is `'YNEOS'[1::2]`, which is `'E'`.

- If `f` is `1`:
  - `f ^ 1` is `0`.
  - The starting index is determined by `m | n < 0`.
    - If `m | n < 0` is `True` (i.e., `1`), the starting index is `1`.
    - If `m | n < 0` is `False` (i.e., `0`), the starting index is `0`.
  - The slice is `'YNEOS'[1::2]`, which is `'E'`, or `'YNEOS'[0::2]`, which is `'YES'`.

### Conclusion

The output depends on the values of `f`, `m`, and `n`. However, based on the possible values, the output can be either `'E'` or `'YES'`.

Output: **'E' or 'YES' (depending on the values of `f`, `m`, and `n`)**
