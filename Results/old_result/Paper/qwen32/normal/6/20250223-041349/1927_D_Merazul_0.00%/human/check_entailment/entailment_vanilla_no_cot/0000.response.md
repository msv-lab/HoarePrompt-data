Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program seems to be attempting to check for some conditions related to the elements in two sets `a` and `b`, but it does not address the problem of finding two different elements within a specified range in an array for each query.

Here is a brief explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input but does not correctly parse it for the problem requirements. It reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the array `a` and the queries, but it does not correctly handle the queries or the array `a` as required.

2. **Logic for Queries**: The main logic of the program is completely unrelated to the problem. It calculates some values `f`, `m`, and `n` based on the presence of elements in sets `a` and `b`, which are incorrectly derived from the input. It then prints 'Y' or 'N' based on some condition, which is not relevant to the problem of finding two different elements within a range.

3. **Output**: The output of the program is not in the required format. The problem requires printing two indices `i` and `j` for each query where `a[i] != a[j]`, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

To correctly solve the problem, one should iterate over each query, extract the subarray from `l` to `r`, and then find two different elements within that subarray. If such elements exist, print their indices; otherwise, print `-1 -1`. Here is a possible correct solution:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(input[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, input[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        q = int(input[index])
        index += 1
        queries = []
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, input[index:index + 2])
            index += 2
            queries.append((l, r))
        
        for l, r in queries:
            found = False
            for i in range(l - 1, r):
                for j in range(i + 1, r):
                    if a[i] != a[j]:
                        results.append(f"{i + 1} {j + 1}")
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

func()
```

This solution correctly handles the input, processes each query, and produces the correct output format.
