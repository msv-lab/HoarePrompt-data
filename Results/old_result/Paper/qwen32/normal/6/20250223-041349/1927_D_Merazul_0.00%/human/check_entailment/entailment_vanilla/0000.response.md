The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. Let's break down the problem and the program to understand why.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Input**:
   - Multiple test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - An array `a` of `n` integers.
     - `q` queries, each defined by a range `[l, r]`.
   
2. **Output**:
   - For each query, find two distinct indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`.
   - If no such pair exists, output `-1 -1`.

### Provided Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (length of the array), the array `a`, `q` (number of queries), and then the queries.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - The program uses sets `a` and `b` to store elements of the array and queries, respectively.
   - The logic inside the loop is unclear and does not seem to address the problem of finding distinct elements within the specified range for each query.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'Y' or 'N' based on some condition, which is not relevant to the problem's output requirements.

### Correct Approach:

1. **For Each Query**:
   - Extract the subarray from `a` defined by the range `[l, r]`.
   - Use a set to track unique elements in the subarray.
   - If the set has more than one element, it means there are distinct elements, and we can find a pair `(i, j)` such that `a[i] != a[j]`.
   - If the set has only one element, it means all elements in the range are the same, and we output `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. It does not handle the queries correctly and does not produce the expected output format.

**Correctness: False**
