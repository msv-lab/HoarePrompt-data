To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, we need to analyze the expression `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]` step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t > 0`: This tells us that `t` is a positive integer.
   - `k`: The last element of the iterable returned by `R()`.
   - `a` and `b`: Sets of elements from the iterable returned by `R()`.
   - `f`: A flag that is `1` if every number from `1` to `k` is in at least one of the sets `a` or `b`; otherwise, it is `0`.
   - `m`: Calculated as `k // 2 - (count of elements in `a` that are not in `b`)`.
   - `n`: Calculated as `k // 2 - (count of elements in `b` that are not in `a`)`.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - `f ^ 1`: The `^` operator is the bitwise XOR operator. If `f` is `1`, `f ^ 1` will be `0`; and if `f` is `0`, `f ^ 1` will be `1`.
   - `m | n < 0`: The `|` operator is the bitwise OR operator. The expression `m | n < 0` is evaluated as `(m | n) < 0` due to operator precedence. This means it checks if the result of `m | n` is less than `0`.
   - `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0`: The `or` operator returns the first truthy value or the last value if all are falsy. If `f ^ 1` is `1` (truthy), it will be the result. Otherwise, it will evaluate `m | n < 0`.
   - `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`: This slices the string `'YNEOS'` starting from the index determined by `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0` and takes every second character.

### Determining the Output

- **Case 1: `f` is `1`**
  - `f ^ 1` is `0`.
  - The expression `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0` evaluates to `0`.
  - `'YNEOS'[0::2]` slices the string starting from index `0` and takes every second character, resulting in `'YES'`.

- **Case 2: `f` is `0`**
  - `f ^ 1` is `1`.
  - The expression `f ^ 1 or m | n < 0` evaluates to `1`.
  - `'YNEOS'[1::2]` slices the string starting from index `1` and takes every second character, resulting in `'NO'`.

### Conclusion

The output of the `print` statement will be either `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on the value of `f`.

Output: **'YES' if `f` is `1`, otherwise 'NO'**
