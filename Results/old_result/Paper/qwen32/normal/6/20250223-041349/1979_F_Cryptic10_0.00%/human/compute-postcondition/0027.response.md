Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `v` is the first return value of `func_1(d)` and `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`; `d` is 0; `path` is now `[0, v, v]` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` initially, otherwise `path` is `[v, v]`; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 and `v`; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Natural language: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
