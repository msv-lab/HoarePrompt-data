Given the initial state and the code snippet, we need to determine the output state after the function call `v, u = func_1(d)`.

The code snippet only updates the values of `v` and `u` by calling the function `func_1(d)`. The value of `d` is also decremented by 1, but this change is not reflected in the output state format provided in the task, so we'll only focus on the changes to `v` and `u`.

The initial state provides a lot of information about the conditions and states of `n`, `remaining_vertices`, `path`, and `d`, but these are not affected by the function call `func_1(d)`. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

The output state will only reflect the new values of `v` and `u` after the function call. Since the function `func_1(d)` is not defined in the problem statement, we can only represent the output state in terms of the return values of `func_1(d)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` three times (with the additional `v` added at the end), and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` contains the vertex `v` once or twice, and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, and `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described. `d` is `d - 1`. `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
