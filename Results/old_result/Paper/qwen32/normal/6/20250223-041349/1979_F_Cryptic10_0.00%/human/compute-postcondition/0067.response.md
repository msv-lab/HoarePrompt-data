Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v`, `u`, and the newly removed `v`. If `v` is 0, then `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `v` and `u`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In simple terms, the values of `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
