Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5; `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except `v` and `u`, where `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` and is not changed; `v` is in `remaining_vertices`; `v` is not 0.**
