The only variable in the loop head is `d`. According to the loop statement `for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, `d` starts at `n - 1` and decrements by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `d` has some value, say `d_prev`. For the loop to execute one more time, `d_prev` must be greater than `-1`, and the new value of `d` at the start of the next iteration would be `d_prev - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust `d` to be `d - 1` for the next iteration. The other variables (`n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, `u`) are not part of the loop head and should remain unchanged.

Let's assume `d` at the end of the previous iteration is `d_prev`. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `d` should be `d_prev - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` contains the single vertex `v`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v`, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is also except `u`. If `v` is 0, then `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `v` and `u`. `d` is `d_prev - 1`**.

Since we don't have the exact value of `d_prev`, we can express the state in terms of `d` as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` contains the single vertex `v`. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v`, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is also except `u`. If `v` is 0, then `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `v` and `u`. `d` is `d - 1`**.
