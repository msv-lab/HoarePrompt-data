Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph; `path` is a list containing the vertex `v` twice if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` contains the single vertex `v`, and now `path` also contains an additional `v` at the end; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v`, and if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, it is also except `u`, and now `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`; `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`; `d` is `d - 1`. If `v` is 0, the state remains unchanged as described.**

In simple terms, the value `v` has been removed from the set `remaining_vertices`. All other variables retain their initial state as described.
