The only variable in the loop head is `d`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `d` would have taken the value `0` if the loop just finished. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be decremented by 1 each time the loop completes an iteration. However, since the loop runs from `n - 1` down to `0`, once `d` reaches `0`, the loop will terminate. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be set to `1` (if `n` is at least `2`), because the loop will then decrement `d` to `0` in the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `d` must have been `1` to allow the loop to execute one more time with `d` being `0` in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5. `path` is [0] if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `path` remains an empty list. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except 0 if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise it contains integers from 1 to `n`. `v` is 0 and `v` is not in `remaining_vertices` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices`, otherwise `v` remains 0. `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)` and remains unchanged. `d` is 1**
