The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables themselves do not change due to the `continue` statement; it only affects the control flow of the loop.

Given the initial state, the variables `n`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`, `v`, and `u` retain their values. Since `v` is currently 0, it remains 0. The `continue` statement does not modify any of the variables but simply instructs the loop to move to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices` and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `v` is 0, `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
