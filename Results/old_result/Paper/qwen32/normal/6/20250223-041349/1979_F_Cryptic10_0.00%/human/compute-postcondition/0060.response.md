The code snippet `v, u = func_1(d)` assigns the values returned by `func_1(d)` to the variables `v` and `u`. Since the function `func_1` and its behavior are not defined, we can only state that `v` and `u` will take on whatever values `func_1(d)` returns.

The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` from `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v` and `u` (which was previously added back to `remaining_vertices`).

After the execution of `v, u = func_1(d)`, the values of `v` and `u` will be updated to whatever `func_1(d)` returns, but the values of `n` and the contents of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged unless `func_1(d)` modifies them, which is not indicated in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of vertices in the graph, `path` is a list containing a single vertex `v` that was in `remaining_vertices` during the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` except the original `v` and `u` was added back to `remaining_vertices` and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.
