### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to find a Hamiltonian path in a modified complete graph (where exactly (n - 2) edges have been removed) using an interactive querying mechanism.

#### Key Components of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - This function sends a query to the interactor asking for the vertex `v` with the minimum degree that is at least `d`, and another vertex `u` that is not connected to `v`.
   - It flushes the output to ensure the query is sent.
   - It reads the response from the interactor and returns the two integers `v` and `u`.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function is the main logic that constructs the Hamiltonian path.
   - It initializes an empty path and a set of remaining vertices.
   - It iteratively queries for vertices with decreasing degrees until it finds a valid vertex `v` that hasn't been added to the path yet.
   - When a valid vertex `v` is found, it adds `v` to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices.
   - The process continues until all vertices are added to the path.
   - Finally, it prints the path in the required format.

#### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The program uses a greedy strategy by querying for vertices with the highest possible degree first. This is logical because in a complete graph with (n - 2) edges removed, the vertices with higher degrees are more likely to be part of the Hamiltonian path.
  - If a vertex `v` with degree at least `d` is found, it ensures that the vertex is part of the path and that there is at least one vertex `u` not connected to `v`, which is consistent with the problem's constraints.
  - The program continues querying until all vertices are included in the path, which aligns with the requirement to find a Hamiltonian path.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where no vertex with degree at least `d` is found (i.e., `v == 0`), and it continues querying with a lower degree.
  - The program ensures that the output format is correct and that the path includes all vertices exactly once.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program makes at most `n` queries, as required by the problem statement.
  - Each query is processed in constant time, and the overall complexity is linear with respect to the number of vertices.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the strategy to find a Hamiltonian path in the modified complete graph using the allowed number of queries.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
