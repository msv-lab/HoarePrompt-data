The code snippet provided initializes a variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are modified or used in this snippet. Therefore, the only change in the output state is the introduction of the variable `ans` with the value 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`. `ca` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`. `ans` is 0.**
