Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m < n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6, `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]` with the count of `a[r]` incremented by 1 and the count of `a[r - m]` decremented by 1. If `ca[a[r - m]]` is less than or equal to `cb[a[r - m]]`, then `sm` is the sum of the minimum of the counts of each element in `ca` and `cb` plus 1, and `sm` has been decremented by 1. Otherwise, `sm` remains the sum of the minimum of the counts of each element in `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
