### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the unnecessary sorting of the lists when creating `Counter` objects (`cb = Counter(sorted(b))` and `ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))`). Sorting the lists disrupts the correct counting of elements in the sliding window, which is not required by the problem. The `Counter` class inherently counts the occurrences of each element, and sorting would incorrectly affect the intersection calculations.

The original assessment also correctly explains the logic of the function `func_1` and how it should work without sorting. The corrected version of the function, as provided in the assessment, removes the sorting and should work correctly.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issue and providing a corrected version of the function. However, the initial statement of the original program's correctness is incorrect because of the sorting issue.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False** (for the given program)  
Final: **True** (after removing the sorting)

Since the task is to evaluate the correctness of the given program, and the given program includes the incorrect sorting step, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
