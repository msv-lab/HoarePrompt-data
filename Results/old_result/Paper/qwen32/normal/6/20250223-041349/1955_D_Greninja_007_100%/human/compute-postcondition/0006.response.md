Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `b` is a list of `m` integers where each element satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6; `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted list `b`; `ca` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in the sorted sublist `a[:m]`; `sm` is the sum of the minimum of the counts of each element in `ca` and `cb`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
