Output State: **`num` is `[[3, 5, [1, 2, 3]]]`, `counter` is 0, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `counter` is 0 because `num[0]` (which is `[3, 5, [1, 2, 3]]`) does not equal `'0'`. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement.
