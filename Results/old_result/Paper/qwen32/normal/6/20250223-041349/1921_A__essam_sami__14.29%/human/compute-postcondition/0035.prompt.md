You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are t test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, there are four lines containing the coordinates of the corners of a square (x_i, y_i) where -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. The coordinates represent a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        e, f = map(int, input().split())
        
        g, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
        
        x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)
        
        if x > n:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(x)
        
    #State: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100); the loop has executed `t` times; for each test case, the program has read four pairs of integers (`a`, `b`), (`c`, `d`), (`e`, `f`), and (`g`, `h`), calculated `n` as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\) and `x` as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\), and printed the smaller of `n` and `x`. The variable `steps` is equal to `t` after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four lines representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The function returns the area of each square based on the provided coordinates.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
