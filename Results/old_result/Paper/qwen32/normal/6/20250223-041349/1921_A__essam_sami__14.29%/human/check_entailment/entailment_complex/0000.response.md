### Reasoning:

The given program is designed to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The key idea here is to calculate the squared distances between pairs of corners and determine the side length of the square. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length will be the minimum of the differences in the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the corners.

However, the program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of corners and prints the smaller of the two squared distances. This approach is flawed because the side length of the square is not necessarily the minimum of these two distances. Instead, the correct approach is to find the difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.

Let's consider the example given:

For the first test case:
```
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

The correct side length is 3 (either the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent corners). The area of the square should be 9.

However, the program calculates:
- Distance between (1, 2) and (1, 5) -> (1-1)^2 + (2-5)^2 = 9
- Distance between (4, 5) and (4, 2) -> (4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 9

The program prints 9, which is correct for this case, but this is not a general solution. It only happened to work because the distances calculated were the same.

For the second test case:
```
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```

The correct side length is 2. The area of the square should be 4.

The program calculates:
- Distance between (-1, 1) and (1, 1) -> (-1-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 = 4
- Distance between (1, -1) and (-1, -1) -> (1+1)^2 + (-1+1)^2 = 4

Again, the program prints 4, but this is not a robust solution.

For the third test case:
```
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```

The correct side length is 28 (either the difference in x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent corners). The area of the square should be 784.

The program calculates:
- Distance between (45, 11) and (17, 11) -> (45-17)^2 + (11-11)^2 = 784
- Distance between (45, 39) and (17, 39) -> (45-17)^2 + (39-39)^2 = 784

The program prints 784, which is correct for this case as well, but again, this is not a general solution.

### Conclusion

The program happens to work for the given examples but does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs. The approach of comparing the squared distances between two pairs of corners is not a reliable method to determine the side length of the square.

**Correctness: False**
