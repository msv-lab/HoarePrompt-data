The variable `x` is assigned the value \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\). The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100); `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input; `c` and `d` are integers obtained from the input; `e` and `f` are integers obtained from the input; `g` and `h` are integers obtained from the input; `n` is \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\); `x` is \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).**
