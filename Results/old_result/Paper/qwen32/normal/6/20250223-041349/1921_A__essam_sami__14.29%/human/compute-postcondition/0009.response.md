To determine what will be printed by the `print(n)` statement, we need to understand the value of `n` based on the given initial state.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` are integers obtained from the input.
- `n` is calculated as \((a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)\).
- `x` is calculated as \((c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)\).
- The current value of `x` is greater than `n`.

### Calculation of `n`:
The value of `n` is derived from the formula:
\[ n = (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2 \]

Since the specific values of `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `n`. However, we can describe `n` in terms of the given variables.

### Output:
The `print(n)` statement will output the value of `n` which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`.

Output: **n (where n is calculated as \((a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2\))**
