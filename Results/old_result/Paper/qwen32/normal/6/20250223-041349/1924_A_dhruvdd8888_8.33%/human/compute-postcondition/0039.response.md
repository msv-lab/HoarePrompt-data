Let's break down the print statement and the given initial state to determine the output:

### Initial State Recap:
- `win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty.
- `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`.
- `ps` is the count of such complete sets, and `ps` is less than `n`.
- `us` must not be empty.
- `i` is the next element in `us`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`''.join(ans)`**: This part converts the list `ans` into a string by joining all its characters. Since `ans` contains characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters, the resulting string will be a sequence of these characters.

2. **`i`**: This is the next element in `us`. Since `us` is not empty and `i` is specifically mentioned as the next element, it will be a single character.

3. **`'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`**: This part constructs a string of 'a's. The number of 'a's is determined by `n - len(ans) - 1`. Here, `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we can infer that `n` is the total length of the string that needs to be formed. The expression `len(ans) + 1` (for `i`) should be less than `n`, hence the remaining characters are filled with 'a's.

### Putting It All Together:
The print statement will concatenate the string formed by joining the elements of `ans`, the next character `i` from `us`, and a sequence of 'a's filling the remaining length up to `n`.

### Output Description:
Since we do not have the exact values for `ans`, `i`, and `n`, we can describe the output in terms of these variables:
- `ans` is a list of characters.
- `i` is the next character in `us`.
- `n` is the total length of the string that needs to be formed.

Thus, the output will be a string that starts with the characters in `ans`, followed by `i`, and then filled with 'a's until the total length of the string is `n`.

### Final Output:
Output: **`''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` (where `ans` is a list of characters, `i` is the next element in `us`, and `n` is the total length of the string to be formed)**
