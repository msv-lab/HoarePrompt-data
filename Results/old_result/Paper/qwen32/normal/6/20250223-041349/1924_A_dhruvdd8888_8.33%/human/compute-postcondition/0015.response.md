The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the string `s`. Therefore, we can only adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration of the loop.

Given that `i` is the current character being processed from the string `s`, for the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000
- `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets
- `i` is an element of `us`
- If `i` is not already in `win`, `win` contains the element `i` and `ans` and `ps` remain unchanged. If `i` is already in `win`, `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` is updated to contain the single element `i`, and `ps` is set to 1.

For the next iteration, `i` should be the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in the string `s`**
