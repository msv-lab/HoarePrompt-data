You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not correctly handle the requirement of checking all possible subsequences.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Checking Logic**:
    - The program attempts to check for subsequences by maintaining a set `win` that collects characters from `s` that are within the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
    - It clears the set `win` once it has collected `k` unique characters, and then it appends the last character to `ans`.
    - This approach does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in `s`. It only checks for a specific pattern of subsequences and does not ensure that all possible combinations are covered.

2. **Generating the Missing Subsequence**:
    - If the program determines that not all subsequences are present, it attempts to generate a missing subsequence by appending characters from `us` (the set of first `k` lowercase English alphabets) to `ans`.
    - This logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the generated string is a valid subsequence that is missing from `s`. It simply appends characters in a specific order, which may not be a valid missing subsequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - The program does not handle edge cases where `n` is larger than `k` or where `s` is very short.
    - For example, if `n` is 3 and `k` is 2, the program should check for all combinations of 'a', 'b', and 'c' of length 3, but it does not do this correctly.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2 6
aabbaa
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
aaa
```

**Actual Output:**
The program may output something incorrect, such as:
```
NO
aab
```

The program does not correctly identify that 'aaa' is a missing subsequence in this case.

To fix the program, a more comprehensive approach is needed, such as generating all possible subsequences of length `n` and checking if each one is present in `s`. This can be computationally expensive for large `n` and `k`, but it is necessary to ensure correctness.
