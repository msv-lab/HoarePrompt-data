Functionality: **The function reads input values for `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`, then checks if there are at least `n` occurrences of a complete set of `k` unique characters in `s`. If so, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string based on the characters found and prints it.**
