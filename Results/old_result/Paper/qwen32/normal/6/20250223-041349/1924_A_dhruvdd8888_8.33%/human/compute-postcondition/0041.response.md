The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in the set `us`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `us`. If there are more elements in `us` that have not been iterated over, the loop will execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next element in `us`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the next element in `us` that has not yet been processed.

Given the provided state:
- `win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty.
- `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`.
- `ps` is the count of such complete sets and is less than `n`.
- `us` must not be empty.
- `i` is the next element in `us`.

Since `i` is the next element in `us` and the loop iterates over `us`, the next state should reflect that `i` is the next element in `us` that has not been processed yet. Therefore, no other state needs to be adjusted except for `i` being the next element in `us`.

State: **`win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty, `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`, `ps` is the count of such complete sets and is less than `n`, `us` must not be empty, `i` is the next element in `us`**
