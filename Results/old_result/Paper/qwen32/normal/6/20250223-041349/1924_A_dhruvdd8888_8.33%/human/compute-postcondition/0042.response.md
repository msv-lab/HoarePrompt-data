Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty.
2. `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`.
3. `ps` is the count of such complete sets and is less than `n`.
4. `us` must not be empty.
5. `i` is the next element in `us`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

### Analysis:
1. `''.join(ans)`: This will concatenate all elements in the list `ans` into a single string.
2. `i`: This is the next element in `us`, which is a character.
3. `'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`: This will create a string consisting of `a` repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times.

### Explanation of the Output:
- The output will be a string composed of three parts:
  1. The concatenation of all characters in the list `ans`.
  2. The character `i` (which is the next element in `us`).
  3. A string of `a` characters, with the number of `a`s being `n - len(ans) - 1`.

Since the exact values of `ans`, `i`, and `n` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

### Final Output:
Output: **`''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` (where `ans` is a list of characters, `i` is the next element in `us`, and `n` is the total number of characters in the final output string)**
