You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads input values for `n`, `k`, `m`, and a string `s`, then checks if there are at least `n` occurrences of a complete set of `k` unique characters in `s`. If so, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string based on the characters found and prints it.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step against the problem requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. For each test case, we need to determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the string `s`.
2. If all such strings are subsequences of `s`, we print "YES".
3. If not, we print "NO" and provide an example of a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
    - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
    - For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Set of Usable Characters**:
    - The program creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

3. **Checking for Subsequences**:
    - The program initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of the characters seen in the current window.
    - It iterates through the string `s` and adds characters to `win` if they are in `us`.
    - If `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the current character to `ans` and clears `win`.
    - It increments `ps` each time a full set of `k` characters is found in `s`.
    - If `ps` is at least `n`, it prints "YES" and returns.

4. **Generating a Missing Subsequence**:
    - If `ps` is less than `n`, it prints "NO".
    - It then attempts to construct a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.
    - The logic here is flawed. The program tries to append characters from `us` that are not in `win` to `ans`, but this approach does not guarantee that the constructed string will not be a subsequence of `s`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The logic to generate a string that is not a subsequence of `s` is incorrect. The program's approach to appending characters from `us` that are not in `win` does not ensure that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.
- The program does not consider the order and combination of characters required to form a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` when `ps` is less than `n`.
