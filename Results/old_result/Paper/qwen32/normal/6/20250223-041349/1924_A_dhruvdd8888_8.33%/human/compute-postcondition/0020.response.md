Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, `s` is the input string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `win` is a set that now contains the character `i`. If `len(win) == k`, then `win` is reset to an empty set, `ans` is a list that now contains the character `i`, and `ps` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `win`, `ans`, or `ps`.**
