Let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`win`**: A set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty.
2. **`ans`**: A list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`.
3. **`ps`**: The count of such complete sets, and `ps` is less than `n`.
4. **`us`**: Must not be empty.
5. **`i`**: Not in `win`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
```

### Explanation:

1. **`''.join(ans)`**: This concatenates all characters in the list `ans` into a single string. Since `ans` contains characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters, the resulting string is a sequence of these characters.

2. **`i`**: This is a single character that is not in the set `win`. Given the precondition, `i` is a character that has not yet completed a set of `k` unique characters.

3. **`'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)`**: This part of the code generates a string consisting of `(n - len(ans) - 1)` number of 'a' characters. Here, `n` represents the total length of the string that needs to be constructed, and `len(ans) + 1` (including `i`) is the length of the string constructed so far. The remaining characters are filled with 'a'.

### Putting It All Together:
The final output will be a string constructed as follows:
- Start with the concatenated string of characters in `ans`.
- Append the character `i`.
- Append a number of 'a' characters equal to `(n - len(ans) - 1)`.

### Output:
Output: **`''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1)` (where `ans` is a list of characters, `i` is a character not in `win`, and `n` is the total length of the string to be constructed)**
