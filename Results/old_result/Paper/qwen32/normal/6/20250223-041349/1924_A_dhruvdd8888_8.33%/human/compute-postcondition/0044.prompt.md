Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty, `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`, `ps` is the count of such complete sets, and `ps` is less than `n`
Code of the loop:
for i in us:
    if i not in win:
        print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty, `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`, `ps` is the count of such complete sets, and `ps` is less than `n`, `us` must not be empty. If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is not added to `win`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty, `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`, `ps` is the count of such complete sets and is less than `n`, `us` must not be empty, and `i` is the next element in `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, then `win` may have been updated to include `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `win` is a set containing fewer than `k` unique characters or is empty, `ans` is a list of characters that were the last character in each complete set of `k` unique characters found in `s`, `ps` is the count of such complete sets and is less than `n`, `us` must not be empty, `i` is the next element in `us`. If `i` is not in `win`, then `i` is added to `win`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
