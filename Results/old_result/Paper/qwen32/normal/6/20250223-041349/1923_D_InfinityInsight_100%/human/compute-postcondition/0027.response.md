The code snippet `ans[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the `i`-th element of the list `ans`. This change only affects the element `ans[i]` in the list `ans`, while all other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1`, `last` is unchanged, and `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`.**
