Let's analyze the loop provided:

```python
for i in a:
    left.append(left[-1] + i)
```

The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`. For each iteration, it appends the sum of the last element of `left` and the current element `i` to the `left` list.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `left` is `[0]`.
- `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`.
- `last` is `[-1]`.

After each iteration:
- The `left` list grows by appending the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the current index.
- `ans` and `last` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- `a` and `n` remain unchanged.

The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the length of `a`.

### Output State after All Iterations:
- `a` remains the same as the initial list of integers.
- `n` remains the length of the list `a`.
- `left` will be a list of cumulative sums, starting with `0` and ending with the sum of all elements in `a`.
- `ans` remains a list of integers, all elements are `-1`.
- `last` remains `[-1]` as it is not modified within the loop.

### Example:
If `a = [1, 2, 3]`, then:
- After the first iteration, `left` becomes `[0, 1]`.
- After the second iteration, `left` becomes `[0, 1, 3]`.
- After the third iteration, `left` becomes `[0, 1, 3, 6]`.

Thus, the final `left` list will be `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` is unchanged, `last` is unchanged.**

In natural language: After all iterations, the `left` list will contain cumulative sums starting from `0` and ending with the total sum of the elements in `a`. The `ans` list and `last` list remain unchanged from their initial states, and `a` and `n` retain their initial values.
