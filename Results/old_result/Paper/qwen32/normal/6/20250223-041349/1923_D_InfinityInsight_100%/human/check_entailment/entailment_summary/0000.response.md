### Reasoning:

Let's break down the provided functions and see if they collectively solve the problem as described.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to find the index of the smallest element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is not found, it returns the insertion point for `x` in the list `a`.
- **Implementation**: The function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the insertion point for `x`. If the element at the found index is equal to `x`, it returns the index + 1; otherwise, it returns the insertion point.
- **Output Hints**: The function returns an index (1-based) if the element is found or the insertion point (1-based) if the element is not found.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, considering the slimes from left to right.
- **Implementation**:
  - It initializes `left` to keep cumulative sums of slime sizes and `last` to keep track of the last index where a different slime size was encountered.
  - It iterates through the list `a` to populate `left` and `last`.
  - For each slime, if the current slime is smaller than the previous one, it sets the answer to 1 (since it will be eaten immediately).
  - Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative sum up to the previous slime and uses `func_1` to find the index where the current slime can eat another slime.
  - It updates the answer based on the index found and the last index where a different slime size was encountered.
- **Output Hints**: The function returns a list `ans` where each element represents the minimum number of seconds it takes for the corresponding slime to be eaten or -1 if it is impossible.

#### Main Execution:
- The main execution reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the number of slimes and their sizes.
- It calls `func_2` twice: once for the original list of slimes and once for the reversed list.
- It then combines the results from both calls to get the final answer for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The approach of calling `func_2` twice (once for the original list and once for the reversed list) ensures that we consider both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left) for each slime.
- The combination of results from both calls ensures that we get the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, considering all possible ways the process can go.
- The use of cumulative sums and binary search in `func_1` allows for efficient computation of the required indices.

Given the provided problem description and the behavior of the functions, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by considering all possible ways the slimes can eat each other and calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
