The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of slimes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, `n` is an integer representing the number of slimes such that `n = len(a)` and `2 <= n <= 3 * 10^5`. Each element in `a` satisfies `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`. `left` is a list with a single element `[0]`. `ans` is a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`. `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, i, i]`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is `[-1, -1, i]`.**
