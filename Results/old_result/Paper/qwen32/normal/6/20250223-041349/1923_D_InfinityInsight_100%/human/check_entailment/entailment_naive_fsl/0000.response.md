Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. The main function `func_2` aims to calculate the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten by another slime, or determine if it is impossible. However, the logic in the code seems flawed and does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement.

Let's analyze a specific case where the code fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

According to the problem statement, the process would go as follows:
- The 2nd slime cannot eat the 1st slime because it is not strictly bigger.
- The 3rd slime cannot eat the 2nd slime because it is not strictly bigger.
- The 4th slime cannot eat the 3rd slime because it is not strictly bigger.
- The 5th slime cannot eat the 4th slime because it is not strictly bigger.

Since no slime can eat another slime, the output should be:
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1
```

However, the provided code will not produce this output. The code attempts to use a prefix sum and binary search approach to determine the minimum number of seconds, but it does not correctly simulate the process where each slime can only eat its neighbor if it is strictly bigger. The code seems to be trying to find some prefix sum condition, which is not directly related to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the code is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the process described in the problem statement, and it fails to handle at least one potential case.
