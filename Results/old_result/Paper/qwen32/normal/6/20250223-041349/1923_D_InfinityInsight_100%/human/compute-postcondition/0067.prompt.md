You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes, and n is an integer representing the number of slimes such that n = len(a) and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5. Each element in a satisfies 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9.
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: - `a` remains unchanged as a list of integers representing the sizes of slimes.
    #- `n` remains unchanged as the length of the list `a`.
    #- `left` remains unchanged as a list with a single element `[0]`.
    #- `ans` remains unchanged as a list of integers, initially all elements are `-1`.
    #- `last` will be a list of indices where the slime sizes change, with the first element being `-1` and subsequent elements indicating the last index of a change.
    #
    #In natural language, after all iterations, the `last` list will contain `-1` as its first element, followed by indices that indicate where the slime sizes change. The `ans` list and `left` list remain unchanged from their initial states, and `a` and `n` retain their initial values.
    #
    #Output State:
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: `a` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` is unchanged, `last` is unchanged.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: `a` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `left` is unchanged, `ans` is modified based on the loop conditions, `last` is unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns the value of `ans` which is modified based on the loop conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` representing the number of slimes, where `n` is equal to the length of the list `a`. The function returns a value `ans` which is computed based on certain loop conditions applied to the elements of the list `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `ans` which is modified based on the loop conditions.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
