Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 1, `left` is `[0, a[0], a[0] + a[1], ..., sum(a)]`, `ans` at index `i` is `1` if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans` at index `i` remains unchanged, `last` is unchanged, `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`, `inx` is equal to `inx2` or `inx` remains unchanged depending on the previous condition, `inx2` is `last[i - 1]`, and `inx` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the loop, depending on the context. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial values and states.
