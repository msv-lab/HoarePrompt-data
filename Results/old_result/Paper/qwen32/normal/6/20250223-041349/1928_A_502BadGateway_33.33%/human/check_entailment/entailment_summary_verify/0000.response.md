### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is insufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. According to the problem description, Bob can form another rectangle if either `a` or `b` is even. This is because:

- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles and form a `b x a` rectangle.
- If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles and form an `a x b` rectangle (which is different from `b x a` if `a != b`).

The provided function summary supports this reasoning by stating that the function only checks if `b` is even. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return "no" for cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd, such as `4 x 1` or `6 x 3`.

The correct solution, as suggested in the original assessment, should check if either `a` or `b` is even:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('Yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'No')
```

This code correctly handles all cases where Bob can form another rectangle by checking if either dimension is even.

### Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not account for the cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final evaluation is **False**.
