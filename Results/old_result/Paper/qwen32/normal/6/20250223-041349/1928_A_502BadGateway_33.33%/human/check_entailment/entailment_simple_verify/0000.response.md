Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The function `func_1` only checks if the width `b` is even, which is insufficient to solve the problem as described. 

According to the problem description, Bob can form another rectangle if either `a` or `b` is even. This is because:
- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles and rearrange them to form a `b x a` rectangle.
- If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles and rearrange them to form an `a x b` rectangle (which is different from `b x a` if `a != b`).

The current code only checks if `b` is even and does not account for the case where `a` is even. Therefore, it will incorrectly return "no" for cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd, such as `4 x 1` or `6 x 3`.

The correct solution, as suggested in the original assessment, should check if either `a` or `b` is even:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('Yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'No')
```

This code correctly determines if Bob can form another rectangle by checking if either dimension is even.

Final: **False**
