Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The function `func_1` only checks if the width `b` is even, which is not the correct logic to solve the problem. 

According to the problem description, Bob can form another rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. This can be achieved if either `a` or `b` is even, because:
- If `a` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a/2 x b` rectangles and form a `b x a` rectangle.
- If `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two `a x b/2` rectangles and form an `a x b` rectangle (which is different from `b x a` if `a != b`).

The current code only checks if `b` is even and does not account for the case where `a` is even. Therefore, it will incorrectly return "no" for cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd, such as `4 x 1` or `6 x 3`.

A correct solution would be:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print('Yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'No')
```

This code checks if either `a` or `b` is even, which correctly determines if Bob can form another rectangle.
