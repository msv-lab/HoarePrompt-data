### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting the original rectangle of size \( a \times b \) by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. The critical observation is that Bob can form a new rectangle if and only if one of the dimensions of the original rectangle is even. This is because an even dimension allows the rectangle to be split into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Let's analyze the provided program:
- The program reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
- It then calls the function `func_1(a, b)`, which checks if \( b \) is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise.

However, this logic is incomplete. The function should check if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, not just \( b \). If either dimension is even, Bob can form a new rectangle. The current implementation only checks for evenness of \( b \), which is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the provided program is **incorrect** because it does not check if \( a \) is even. It only checks \( b \), which is insufficient to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle.

Correctness: **False**
