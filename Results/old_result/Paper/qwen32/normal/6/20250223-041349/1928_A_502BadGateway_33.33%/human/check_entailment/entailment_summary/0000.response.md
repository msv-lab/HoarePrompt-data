Reasoning: The provided program does not correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given a Ã— b rectangle according to the problem description. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' if it is not. However, the problem requires checking whether the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle.

For example, even if `b` is odd, it's still possible to form a different rectangle in some cases. Specifically, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles if `a` is even. The key point is that one of the dimensions of the original rectangle must be even to allow for the rearrangement into a different rectangle.

The correct logic should be to check if either `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, it's possible to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a different rectangle. Therefore, the correct implementation should be:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
