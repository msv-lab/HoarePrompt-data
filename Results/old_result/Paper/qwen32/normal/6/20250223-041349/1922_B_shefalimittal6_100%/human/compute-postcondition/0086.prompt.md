Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `2n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element is incremented based on the values of `x` read from `data`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if v[i] >= 2:
        ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2
    if v[i] >= 3:
        ans += v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6
    cnt += v[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 3, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element is incremented based on the values of `x` read from `data`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[0]`, `ans` is updated based on the value of `v[i]` if it is greater than or equal to 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 3, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element is incremented based on the values of `x` read from `data`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[3]`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2`. `i` is 3. If `v[3]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further updated by adding `v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is 4, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace with at least 3 elements, `idx` is 3, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element is incremented based on the values of `x` read from `data`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[0]`, `i` is 0. If `v[i]` (which is `v[0]` in this context) is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated by adding `v[0] * (v[0] - 1) * (v[0] - 2) // 6` to its previous value. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
