The code snippet `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` by converting the string at index `idx` in the `data` list to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `idx` is `n + 5`, the value of `x` will be the integer value of `data[n + 5]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2] - 1` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `n + 5`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the element at index `x` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` which is 2, `ans` is the accumulated sum of certain combinations based on the counts in `v`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 5]`.**
