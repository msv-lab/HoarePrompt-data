The code snippet assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `x`. Given the initial state, `idx` is `n + 3`. Therefore, `x` will be assigned the value of `data[n + 3]` converted to an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `n + 3`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element is 0, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of certain combinations based on the counts in `v`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`.**
