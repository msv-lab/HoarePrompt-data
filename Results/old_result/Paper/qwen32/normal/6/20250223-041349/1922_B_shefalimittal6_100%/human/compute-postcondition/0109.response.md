The code snippet `ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to it.

Given:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n.
- `input` is a string containing all the input data.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace.
- `idx` is `12 + n`.
- `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`.
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `ans` is 0.
- `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.

Since `cnt` is 0, the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `ans` remains 0 after the execution of the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `12 + n`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` followed by the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
