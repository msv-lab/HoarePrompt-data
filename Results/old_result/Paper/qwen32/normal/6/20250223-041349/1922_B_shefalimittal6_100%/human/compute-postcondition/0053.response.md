The code snippet only modifies the `idx` variable by incrementing it by 1. Therefore, the value of `idx` changes from `n + 3` to `n + 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= n, `input` is a string containing all the input data, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` on whitespace, `idx` is `n + 4`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where each element is 0, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v`, and `ans` is the accumulated sum of certain combinations based on the counts in `v`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`.**
