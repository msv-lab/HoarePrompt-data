Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is `[1, 2]` if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` is `[2]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0.**
