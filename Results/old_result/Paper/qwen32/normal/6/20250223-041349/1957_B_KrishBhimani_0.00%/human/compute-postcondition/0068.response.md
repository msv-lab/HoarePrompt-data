The code snippet `k = k >> 1` performs a right bitwise shift operation on the variable `k`, effectively dividing `k` by 2 and discarding the remainder. This operation changes the value of `k` but does not affect the other variables.

Given the initial state, `k` must be at least 1. After the operation, `k` will be half of its original value, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the original `k` divided by 2 (rounded down); `i` is 2; `arr` is `[1, 2]` if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` is `[2]`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0.**
