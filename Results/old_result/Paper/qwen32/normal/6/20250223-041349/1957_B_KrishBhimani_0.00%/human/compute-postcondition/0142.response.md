To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it processes each test case. Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the input consists of two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - `k` is decomposed into its binary representation.
   - The binary decomposition is stored in the list `arr`, where each element is the position of a set bit in `k`.
   - `ans` is constructed based on the elements in `arr`:
     - The first `len(arr)` elements of `ans` are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions in `arr`.
     - The remaining elements of `ans` are filled with zeros.
     - The last element of `ans` is adjusted so that the sum of `ans` equals `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the list `ans` is printed.

Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can infer the pattern and generalize it for all iterations:

- **After the first iteration**:
  - `k` is 0, so `arr` is empty, and `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.

- **After the second iteration**:
  - `k` is decomposed into binary, and `arr` contains the positions of set bits. For example, if `k` is 12 (binary `1100`), `arr` would be `[2, 3]`.
  - `ans` is constructed based on these positions and adjusted to sum to `k`.

- **After the third iteration**:
  - `k` is 1, so `arr` is `[0]`, and `ans` is constructed accordingly.

The output state after all iterations will be a series of lists `ans` for each test case, where each `ans` is constructed as described above.

**Output State: **The output state after all iterations is a series of lists `ans` for each test case, where each `ans` is constructed based on the binary decomposition of `k` and adjusted to sum to `k`. Each `ans` list will have `n` elements, with the first `len(arr)` elements being powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of set bits in `k`, and the remaining elements being zeros, with the last element adjusted to ensure the sum equals `k`.**

In simpler terms, the output state is a series of lists, one for each test case, where each list represents the constructed `ans` based on the binary representation of `k` and the constraints of `n`.
