To determine the final state of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the binary representation of `k`. The loop continues to execute as long as `k` is not zero. In each iteration, the least significant bit (LSB) of `k` is checked. If it is 1, the current index `i` is appended to the list `arr`. Then, `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit (equivalent to integer division by 2), and `i` is incremented by 1.

The loop will terminate when all bits of `k` have been processed, i.e., when `k` becomes 0. The final state of `arr` will contain the indices of all positions where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `k` was 1.

Given the initial state and the behavior of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

- `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` remains a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.
- `n` remains the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` becomes 0.
- `k0` remains equal to the original value of `k`.
- `i` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, which is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`.
- `arr` contains the indices of all positions where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `k0` was 1.

In natural language, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`; `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`; `arr` contains the indices of all positions where the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `k0` was 1.**
