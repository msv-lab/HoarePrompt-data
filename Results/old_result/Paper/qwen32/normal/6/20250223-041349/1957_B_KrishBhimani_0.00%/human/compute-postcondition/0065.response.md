The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `k // 2`, meaning `k` is halved each time the loop runs.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be non-zero at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `k` must be at least 1 before the next iteration begins.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` must be at least 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [1] if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` remains []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0**
