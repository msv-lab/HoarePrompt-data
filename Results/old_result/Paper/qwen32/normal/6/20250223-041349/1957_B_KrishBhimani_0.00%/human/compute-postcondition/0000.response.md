In the provided for loop, the only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a loop variable that we don't plan to use. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which should be the number of test cases, `t`.

Given that `t` is already defined as an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the input function returns this value `t` for the loop to execute correctly.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `_`, and we cannot adjust `_` directly, we need to ensure that the input function returns the correct number of test cases. However, since `t` is already provided as part of the state, we just need to make sure that the input function reflects this value.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should ensure that the input function returns `t`. Since `t` is already provided and we are only allowed to adjust the state of objects in the loop head, we don't need to adjust `_` or any other variables directly. The state remains as provided, with the understanding that the input function will return `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4**
