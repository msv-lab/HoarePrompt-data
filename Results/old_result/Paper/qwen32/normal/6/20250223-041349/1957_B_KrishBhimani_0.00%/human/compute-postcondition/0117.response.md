To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the behavior of the loop based on the initial state and the provided output states after the first three iterations.

The loop processes the value of `k` by examining its least significant bit (LSB) and then right-shifting `k` by one bit in each iteration. The loop continues until `k` becomes 0. The value of `i` increments in each iteration, and `arr` collects the values of `i` for which the LSB of `k` was 1.

From the given states:
- After 1 iteration: `k` was divided by 2, and `arr` contains `[0]` if `k` was odd before the shift.
- After 2 iterations: `k` became 0, indicating that the initial value of `k` was 1 (since 1 in binary is `01`, and the right shift of `01` results in `00`).
- After 3 iterations: `k` remains 0, and `arr` remains `[1]` because the loop stops once `k` becomes 0.

Given that `k` became 0 after 2 iterations, it means `k` was initially 1. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly 2 times before `k` becomes 0. The final state after these iterations will be:

- `t` remains unchanged.
- `l1` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` is 0.
- `k0` is 1 (the initial value of `k`).
- `i` is 2 (incremented in each of the 2 iterations).
- `arr` is `[0]` because the LSB of `k` (which was 1) was 1 in the first iteration.
- `ans` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; l1 is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; n is the integer value of the first element of l1; k is 0; k0 is 1; i is 2; arr is [0]; ans is [8, 8, 4, -20]; c is n.**

In natural language: The final state has `k` as 0, `i` as 2, and `arr` containing `[0]` because the initial value of `k` was 1, causing the loop to execute twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
