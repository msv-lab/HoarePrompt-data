Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l1 = input().split()
    n, k = list(map(int, l1))
    arr = []
    k0 = k
    i = 0
    while k:
        if k & 1 == 1:
            arr.append(i)
        k = k >> 1
        i += 1
    ans = []
    c = 0
    for i in arr:
        if c == n - 1:
            ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
            break
        c += 1
        ans.append(1 << i)
    ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr` is []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is the last value from `arr` (which could be 2 or 3 depending on the exact number of iterations); `arr` is [2, 3]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [0, 2, ..., 2*(n-1)]; `c` is `n`; `ans` is [4, 4, ..., 4, 1 - 4*(n-1)]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
