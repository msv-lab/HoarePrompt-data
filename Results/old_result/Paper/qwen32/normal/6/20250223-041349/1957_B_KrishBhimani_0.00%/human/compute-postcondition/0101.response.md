The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is a non-zero integer value of the second element of `l1`; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 0; `arr` is []; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`**
