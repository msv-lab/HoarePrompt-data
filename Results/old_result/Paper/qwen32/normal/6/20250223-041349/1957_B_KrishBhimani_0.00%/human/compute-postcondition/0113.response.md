The code snippet `arr.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the end of the list `arr`. Given that `i` is 2, `arr` will now be `[1, 2]`.

The other variables remain unchanged as per the provided initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 1; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [1, 2]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**
