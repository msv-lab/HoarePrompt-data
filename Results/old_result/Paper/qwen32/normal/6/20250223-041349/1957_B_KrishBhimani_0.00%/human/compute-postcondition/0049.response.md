The code snippet `l1 = input().split()` will overwrite the existing `l1` with a new list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Since the initial value of `l1` is a list of substrings from a previous input, and this line of code will replace `l1` with a new list from the current input, the new `l1` will be dependent on the new input provided. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `arr`, `ans`, and `c` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is 0; `i` is 0; `arr` is []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0**.
