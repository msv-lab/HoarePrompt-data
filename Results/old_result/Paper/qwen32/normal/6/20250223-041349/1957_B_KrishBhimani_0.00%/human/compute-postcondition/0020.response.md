The code snippet `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift on the variable `k`. This operation effectively divides `k` by 2 and discards any remainder, which is equivalent to integer division by 2.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `k0` is equal to the original value of `k` and must be at least 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `arr` is `[1, 2]` if the original `k` was an odd integer, otherwise `arr` is `[2]`.

The value of `k` is updated to `k >> 1`, which means `k` is now `k // 2` (integer division by 2).

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is `k0 // 2`; `k0` is equal to the original value of `k` and must be at least 2; `i` is 2; `arr` is `[1, 2]` if the original `k` was an odd integer, otherwise `arr` is `[2]`.**
