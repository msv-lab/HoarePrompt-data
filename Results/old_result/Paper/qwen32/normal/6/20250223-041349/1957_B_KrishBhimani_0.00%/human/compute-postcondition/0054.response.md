The `while` loop condition in the provided code is `while k:`. This loop will execute as long as `k` is a non-zero value. Therefore, to ensure that the first iteration of the loop can proceed, `k` must be a non-zero integer.

Let's analyze the variables involved in the loop condition:
- The only variable in the loop head is `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`
- `k0` is the integer value of `k`
- `i` is 0
- `arr` is []
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros
- `c` is 0

Since `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, to ensure that the loop executes, `k` must be a non-zero integer. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to be a non-zero value. Specifically, `k` should be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is a non-zero integer (greater than 0); `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 0; `arr` is []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0**
