The code snippet `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` modifies the list `ans` by appending a new value. Hereâ€™s the detailed impact:

1. `k0` is the integer value of `k`, which is 0.
2. `sum(ans)` calculates the sum of the elements in the list `ans`. Given that `ans` is either `[8, 8]` or `[0, 8, 8]`, the sum will be either 16 or 16, respectively.
3. The expression `k0 - sum(ans)` evaluates to `0 - 16`, which is `-16`.
4. The value `-16` is appended to the list `ans`.

Thus, the list `ans` will be updated to either `[8, 8, -16]` or `[0, 8, 8, -16]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `k0` is the integer value of `k`; `i` is 2; `arr` is [2, 3]; `c` is `n + 1`; `ans` is either [8, 8, -16] or [0, 8, 8, -16]**.
