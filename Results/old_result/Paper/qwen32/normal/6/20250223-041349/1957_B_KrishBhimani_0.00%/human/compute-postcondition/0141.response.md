Let's break down the given information step-by-step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4.
   - `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `k0` is 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `arr` is [0, 2, ..., 2*(n-1)].
   - `c` is `n`.
   - `ans` is [4, 4, ..., 4, 1 - 4*(n-1)].

2. **Understanding the `ans` List**:
   - The `ans` list is constructed such that it contains `n-1` elements of value 4, followed by one element of value `1 - 4*(n-1)`.

3. **The Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

**Detailed Output Explanation**:
- If `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, then the `ans` list will have `n` elements.
- The first `n-1` elements of `ans` are all 4.
- The `n`-th element of `ans` is `1 - 4*(n-1)`.

Let's illustrate this with an example. Suppose `n = 3`, then:
- The `ans` list would be `[4, 4, 1 - 4*(3-1)]` which simplifies to `[4, 4, 1 - 8]` or `[4, 4, -7]`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

**General Output**:
- For any `n`, the output will be `n-1` number of 4s followed by `1 - 4*(n-1)`.

Output: **4 4 ... 4 (n-1 times) 1 - 4*(n-1) (where n is the integer value of the first element of the list l1)**
