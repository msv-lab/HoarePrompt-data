Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 0 <= t-1 <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is 1; `k0` is 1; `i` is 2; `arr` is [1, 2] if `k` & 1 == 1, otherwise `arr` remains [1]; `ans` is [8, 8, 4, -20]; `c` is `n`.**
