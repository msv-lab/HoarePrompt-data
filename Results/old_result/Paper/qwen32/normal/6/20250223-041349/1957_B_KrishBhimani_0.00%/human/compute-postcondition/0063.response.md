The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, effectively dividing `k` by 2 and discarding the remainder. Given that `k` is initially `k0 // 2` and `k0` must be at least 2, `k` is initially at least 1.

After the operation, the value of `k` will be `k // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`; `k` is `k // 2`; `i` is 1; `arr` is [1] if `k` is odd, otherwise `arr` remains []; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `c` is 0.**
