The code snippet splits the input string into a list of substrings and then maps these substrings to integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`.

Given that `l1` is a list of substrings, and `n` and `k` are derived from the first two elements of `l1` after converting them to integers, the values of `n` and `k` will be the integer representations of the first two elements of `l1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace; `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`; `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.**
