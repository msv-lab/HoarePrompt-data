Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is 0, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements. If `c` was `n - 1` initially, then `ans` is `[0, 1, k0 - 1, 1 << i, - (1 << i)]` and `c` is `n`, otherwise `ans` is `[1, k0 - 1, 1 << i]` and `c` is its original value plus 1. If `c` was `n - 1` initially, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
