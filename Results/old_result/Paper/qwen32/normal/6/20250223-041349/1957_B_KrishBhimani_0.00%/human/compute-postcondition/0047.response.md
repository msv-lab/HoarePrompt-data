Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
2. `l1` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting an input string on whitespace.
3. `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
4. `k` is initialized to 0.
5. `k0` is initialized to 0.
6. `i` is initialized to 0.
7. `arr` is initialized as an empty list.
8. `ans` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
9. `c` is initialized to 0.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The `*` operator in the `print` function unpacks the list `ans` and passes each element as a separate argument to the `print` function.
- `ans` is a list of `n` zeros. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the list in terms of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print `n` zeros, where `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `l1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **0 0 0 ... 0 (where there are n zeros, and n is the integer value of the first element of the list l1)**
