Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `nabors` is `nabors - 1` and greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that `0 < m < n`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0`, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0`, `fnd` is 3 if `tot >= k` else 2, and `C[in_aa]` and `D[in_aa]` or `E[in_aa]` are updated based on the conditions provided, `in_aa` is the next element from `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element from `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`. If `D[out_aa] == 0`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`. If `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**
