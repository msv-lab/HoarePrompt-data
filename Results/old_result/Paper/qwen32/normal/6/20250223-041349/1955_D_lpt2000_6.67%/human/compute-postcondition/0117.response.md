Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is the length of `aa`, `m` is `m + 1`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a new list of integers from the latest input, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `tot` is the previous `tot` minus the value of `D[out_aa]` before the decrement, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. In both cases, `fnd` is 3 if the new `tot` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0.**
