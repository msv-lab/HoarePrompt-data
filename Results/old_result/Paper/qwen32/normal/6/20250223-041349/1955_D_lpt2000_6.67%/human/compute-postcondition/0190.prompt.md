Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^6. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `nabors` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is unchanged, nabors is greater than 0, n is the length of aa, m is n, aa is a list of integers with length n, bb is a new list of integers from the latest input, cnt_aa is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the entire aa, cnt_bb is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list bb, D is a Counter object representing the intersection of cnt_aa and cnt_bb, E and C are updated based on the loop conditions, tot is the sum of the values in D, fnd is incremented by 1 for each iteration where tot >= k.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is unchanged, `nabors` is `nabors - 1` and greater than 0, `n` and `m` are unchanged, `aa` and `bb` are unchanged, `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` are unchanged, `D`, `E`, and `C` are updated based on the loop's logic, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D` after all iterations, `fnd` is `1 + (number of times tot >= k during n - m iterations)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
