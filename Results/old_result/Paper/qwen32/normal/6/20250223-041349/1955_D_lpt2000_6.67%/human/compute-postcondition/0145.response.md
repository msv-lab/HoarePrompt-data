Postcondition: **`t` is unchanged, `nabors` is `nabors - 1` and greater than 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that `0 < m < n`, `aa` is a list of integers with length `n`, `bb` is a list of integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of each integer in the list `bb`, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb` with `D[out_aa]` decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `E` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` with `E[out_aa]` decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `C` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` with `C[out_aa]` increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was 0, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D` decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, and `fnd` is 1 if `tot >= k` else 0.**
