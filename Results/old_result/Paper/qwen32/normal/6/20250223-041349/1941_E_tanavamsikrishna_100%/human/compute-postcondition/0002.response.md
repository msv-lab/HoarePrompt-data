To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state. The code snippet creates a new list `costs` by applying the function `func_1` to each row in the 2D list `rows`. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, so we will assume it returns some value based on the row and the integer `d`.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `d` is an input integer.
- `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
```

This line of code iterates over each row in `rows` and applies the function `func_1` to it along with the integer `d`. The result of this function call is stored in a new list called `costs`.

Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values that will be stored in `costs`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the new variable `costs` and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m`, where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`; `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.**
