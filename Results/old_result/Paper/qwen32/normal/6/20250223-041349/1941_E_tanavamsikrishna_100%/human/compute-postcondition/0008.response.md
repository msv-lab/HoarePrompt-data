The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.

No other variables in the loop head need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with dimensions `n x m` where each element `a_{i, j}` is an integer input from the user, and `a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0` for all `i`; `rows` must have at least `k` rows; `costs` is a list of values returned by `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements from index 1 to `k` of `costs`; `i` is 2**
