### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotations to determine the correctness of the solution.

#### Function `func_1`

This function is supposed to calculate the minimum cost to install supports in a single row. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The first element of the row is set to `1`.
   - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by `2` sequentially. This part of the code seems correct for initializing the first `d` elements.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is created from the first `d` elements of the row. This heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost encountered within a sliding window of size `d+2`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program iterates through the rest of the row, updating the cost for each position based on the minimum cost in the heap.
   - It pops elements from the heap that are out of the sliding window range. The current implementation uses a `while` loop to pop elements from the heap that are out of the sliding window range. However, the loop does nothing (`pass` statement), which means elements out of the sliding window are not effectively removed from the heap. This is a critical issue.
   - It calculates the cost for the current position as the minimum cost from the heap plus the current cell's cost plus `1`.
   - It pushes the current cost and index back into the heap.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The cost of the last element in the modified row is returned, which represents the minimum cost to install supports in that row.

The critical issue here is the incorrect management of the heap. The `while` loop intended to remove elements out of the sliding window range does nothing, leading to incorrect results.

#### Function `func_2`

This function handles multiple test cases and calculates the minimum total cost for each test case.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Reads the number of test cases and for each test case, reads the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`), the number of bridges (`k`), and the maximum distance between supports (`d`).

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each row in the grid, it calculates the minimum cost to install supports using `func_1`.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - For each possible set of `k` consecutive rows, it calculates the total cost of installing supports and stores these sums.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Correctness Analysis

The program's logic is correct in terms of the intended approach, but the implementation has a critical issue in the heap management within `func_1`. The `while` loop that is supposed to remove elements out of the sliding window range does nothing, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

Despite the overall logic being correct, the implementation has issues in heap management that could lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to be correct for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
