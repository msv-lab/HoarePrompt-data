You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        bullets_used = 0
        can_survive = True
        for (pos, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes `t` test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `x`. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters, where each monster has a position `x[i]` and health `a[i]`, using bullets with a maximum range of `k` units. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated without exceeding the bullet range for any monster, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program correctly solves the problem, we need to analyze its logic and compare it with the problem requirements.

The program follows these steps:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` (number of monsters), `k` (maximum bullets that can be fired per second), the list of health points `a` for each monster, and the list of positions `x` for each monster.
2. **Sorting Monsters**: It sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character (point 0), using `abs(x)`.
3. **Simulation**: It then iterates over the sorted list of monsters and calculates the total number of bullets needed to kill each monster. It checks if the total bullets needed exceed the maximum bullets that can be fired before the monster reaches the character. If at any point the bullets needed exceed the maximum possible, it sets `can_survive` to `False` and breaks the loop.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints "YES" if the character can survive and kill all monsters, otherwise "NO".

### Analysis:

1. **Sorting by Distance**: Sorting the monsters by their distance from the character makes sense because the closer monsters need to be dealt with first to prevent them from reaching the character. This matches the problem's requirement to prevent any monster from reaching the character.

2. **Bullet Calculation**: The program calculates the total bullets needed to kill each monster and checks if it is feasible to do so within the constraints. The condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k` checks if the total bullets needed to kill the current monster exceed the maximum bullets that can be fired before the monster reaches the character.

3. **Logic**: The logic of the program is correct because it ensures that the character only fires bullets when it is feasible to do so without letting any monster reach the character. If at any point, the bullets needed exceed the maximum possible, it correctly concludes that the character cannot survive.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether the character can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the character. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
