Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the new input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must have at least one tuple; `bullets_used` is 0; `(pos, health)` is the first tuple in the `monsters` list; `distance` is `abs(pos)`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `can_survive` remains True.**
