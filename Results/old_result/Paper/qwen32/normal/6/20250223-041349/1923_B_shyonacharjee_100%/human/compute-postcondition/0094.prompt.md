Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 3 * 10^5 and 1 <= `k` <= 2 * 10^9. `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 for all 1 <= `i` <= `n`. `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` are integers such that -`n` <= `x_1` < `x_2` < ... < `x_n` <= `n` and `x_i` != 0 for all 1 <= `i` <= `n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
    bullets_used = 0
    can_survive = True
    for pos, health in monsters:
        distance = abs(pos)
        total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
        if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
            can_survive = False
            break
        bullets_used += health
    print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x`; `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all processed monsters; `can_survive` is True if the total bullets needed never exceeded the distance times k for any monster, otherwise False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x`; `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all monsters; `can_survive` is True if the loop completes all iterations without breaking, otherwise False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the new input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x`; `bullets_used` is the sum of all `health` values in `monsters` if `can_survive` is `True`, otherwise it is the sum of `health` values up to the point where `total_bullets_needed` exceeds `distance * k`; `can_survive` is `True` if `total_bullets_needed` never exceeds `distance * k` for any tuple, otherwise `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
