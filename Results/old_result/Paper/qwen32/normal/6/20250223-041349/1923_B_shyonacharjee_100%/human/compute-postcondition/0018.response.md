Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 3 * 10^4; `n` and `k` are integers read from the input; `a` is a list of integers read from the input; `x` is a list of integers read from the input; `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the elements in `x` and must contain at least two tuples; `pos` is the position of the next monster; `health` is the health of the next monster; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`.**

In this output state, the variable `total_bullets_needed` has been updated to be the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. All other variables retain their initial state and values.
