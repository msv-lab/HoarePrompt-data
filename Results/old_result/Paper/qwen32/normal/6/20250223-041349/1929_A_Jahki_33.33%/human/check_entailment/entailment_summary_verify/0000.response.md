Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the function summary.

### Problem Description Recap
- Sasha wants to maximize the beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
- The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).
- The task is to rearrange the array to maximize this beauty.

### Program Analysis
The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum possible beauty by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.

### Function Summary
- `func_1(a, num2)`: Checks if the array `a` is strictly increasing. Returns `True` if the array is in non-decreasing order, and `False` otherwise.

### Code Logic
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The number of test cases `t` is read.
   - For each test case, the length of the array `n` and the array elements are read.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program incorrectly outputs `0`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

### Original Assessment
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because:
- It incorrectly outputs `0` when the array is already in non-decreasing order.
- The function `func_1` is flawed because it returns `True` when the array is in non-decreasing order, which is incorrect.

### Evaluation
Let's verify the correctness of the program based on the function summary and the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function correctly checks if the array is in non-decreasing order.
   - However, the logic that uses this function is flawed. The program should calculate the beauty regardless of the initial order of the array.

2. **Beauty Calculation Logic:**
   - The program sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach is correct because sorting the array in non-decreasing order maximizes the beauty.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct because the program incorrectly outputs `0` when the array is already in non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` is not the root cause of the problem, but the logic that uses it is flawed. The beauty should always be calculated by sorting the array and summing the differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
