Postcondition: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. Additionally, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` equals 0, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
