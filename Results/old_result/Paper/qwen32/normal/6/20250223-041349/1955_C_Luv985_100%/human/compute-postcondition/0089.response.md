Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0 but is now `T - 1`, `t` (possibly modified), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 but is now `k - mi * 2`, `a` is the new list from the input split by spaces with all elements converted to integers and the element at index `l` (which is 1 if `a[0] == 0`, otherwise `l` remains 0) is reduced by `mi`, the element at index `r` (which is `n - 1`) is reduced by `mi`, `l` is 1 if `a[0] == 0`, otherwise `l` remains 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1 if `a[0] == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, if `a[0] == 0`, the element at index 0 in the list `a` is now 0.**
