Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 or `t` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is updated (`k - mi * 2` in the if part, remains the same in the else part), `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` and `a[r]` may have been adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 0 unless `a[l] == 0` in which case `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the conditions, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r] == 0` or `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` before any adjustments.**
