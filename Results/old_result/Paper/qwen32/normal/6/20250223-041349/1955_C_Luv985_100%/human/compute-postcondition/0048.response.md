Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 or `t` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 (decreased by `mi * 2` if `mi * 2 <= k`), `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` and `a[r]` may have been adjusted by subtracting `mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the conditions. If `mi * 2 <= k`, `ans` is increased by 1 and `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` becomes 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`.**
