The code snippet assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The values of `T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**
