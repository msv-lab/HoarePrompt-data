Output State: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `r` must be at least `l + 1`.**

The value of `t` is now the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
