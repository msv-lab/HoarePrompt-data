Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the conditions; `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
