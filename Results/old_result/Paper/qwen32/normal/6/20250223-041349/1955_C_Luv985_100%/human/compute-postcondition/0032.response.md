Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the conditions. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` becomes 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2` and `ans` is set to 1 if `a[l]` is not 0, otherwise `ans` is set to 2. If `a[r]` is not 0, `r` remains `n - 1` and `ans` remains 0 if `a[l]` is not 0, otherwise `ans` is set to 1. If `a[l]` is 0, it remains 0. `l` is set to 0 if `a[l]` is not 0, otherwise `l` is set to 1. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is set to 1 if `a[l] - t - k // 2` is equal to 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
