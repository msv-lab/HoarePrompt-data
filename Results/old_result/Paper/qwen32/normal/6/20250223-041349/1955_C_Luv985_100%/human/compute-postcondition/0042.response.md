Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0 decreased by `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi` and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `l` remains 0 unless `a[l]` was 0, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[l]` was 0, and `ans` is increased by 1.**

In simpler terms, the value of `r` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
