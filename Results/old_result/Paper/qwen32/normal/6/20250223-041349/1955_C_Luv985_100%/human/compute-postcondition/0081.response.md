Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0 but is now `T - 1`, `t` (possibly modified), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is the new list from the input split by spaces with all elements converted to integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`**

Natural Language: The variable `mi` is assigned the value of the minimum between the elements at the leftmost (`a[l]`) and rightmost (`a[r]`) positions of the list `a`. All other variables retain their previous values with the precondition that `T` is now `T - 1`, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, and `l` and `r` are set to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively.
