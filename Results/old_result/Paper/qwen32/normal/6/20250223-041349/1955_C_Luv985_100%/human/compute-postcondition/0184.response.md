Postcondition: **`T` is greater than `number_of_iterations` minus 1, `t` is modified, `n` is at least 2, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is recalculated as the minimum of the updated `a[0]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is set to 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `l` remains 0. If `a[r]` is 0, then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decreased by 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is either 0 or 1, and if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
