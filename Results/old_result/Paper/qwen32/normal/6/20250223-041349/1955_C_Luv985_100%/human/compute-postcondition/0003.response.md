Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The value of `T` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
