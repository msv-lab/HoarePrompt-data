Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, and `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
