The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the length of `nums`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `nums` has at least one element for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is initialized automatically by the `range` function and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input set of strings and must have at least 1 element, `ls` is 0**
