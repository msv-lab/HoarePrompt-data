The code `ls += nums[i]` modifies the variable `ls` by appending the element `nums[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `ls` is initially `nums[i]`, and after the operation, `ls` becomes a list containing the initial `nums[i]` and the new `nums[i]`.

Given that `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers and `i` is incremented by 1 after the initial assignment, the new value of `ls` will be a list containing two elements: the previous `nums[i]` and the current `nums[i]`.

However, the problem statement does not explicitly state that `i` is incremented before this operation, so we assume `i` remains the same during this operation. Thus, `ls` will be a list containing `nums[i]` twice.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input set of strings and must have at least 1 element where `nums[i]` is 0, `ls` is a list containing `nums[i]` twice, `i` is `i + 1`**.

In simpler terms: `ls` now contains the same element `nums[i]` twice, and `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
