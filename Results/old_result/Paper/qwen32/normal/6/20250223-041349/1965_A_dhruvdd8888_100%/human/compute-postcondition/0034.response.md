To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior and how the variables `nw` and `cw` change based on the values in the `nums` list.

### Loop Analysis:
- The loop iterates from `len(nums) - 2` down to `1`.
- For each iteration:
  - If `nums[i] == 1`, `cw` is set to the opposite of `nw` (`cw = not nw`).
  - Otherwise, `cw` is set to `True` (`cw = True`).
  - `nw` is then set to the current value of `cw` (`nw = cw`).

### Final State Determination:
- The loop starts with `i = len(nums) - 2` and ends with `i = 1`.
- The final values of `nw` and `cw` depend on the last iteration, which is when `i = 1`.

### Final Iteration (i = 1):
- If `nums[1] == 1`, `cw` becomes `not nw`, and then `nw` is set to `cw`.
- If `nums[1] != 1`, `cw` becomes `True`, and then `nw` is set to `cw`.

### Initial State and Final State:
- Initially, `nw` is `True` and `cw` is `True`.
- The final state of `nw` and `cw` is determined by the value of `nums[1]`:
  - If `nums[1] == 1`, `cw` becomes `False` (since `nw` is initially `True`), and then `nw` becomes `False`.
  - If `nums[1] != 1`, `cw` remains `True`, and then `nw` also becomes `True`.

### Conclusion:
- Since the loop ends at `i = 1`, the final values of `nw` and `cw` are determined by the value of `nums[1]`.
- `ls` and other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

### Final Output State:
- If `nums[1] == 1`, `nw` and `cw` are both `False`.
- If `nums[1] != 1`, `nw` and `cw` are both `True`.

Given the information in the problem, the final output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `cw` is `True`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `nw` and `cw` will be `False` if `nums[1]` is `1`, otherwise, they will be `True`.
