Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `True`, `cw` is `False`. The current element `nums[i]` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The value of `cw` has been changed to `False` because `nw` is `True`, and the expression `not nw` evaluates to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
