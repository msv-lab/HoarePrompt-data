Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a list, `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums`, `nw` is `False` if `nums[1]` is equal to 1, otherwise `nw` is `True`, and `cw` is `True` if `nums[1]` is not equal to 1, otherwise `cw` is `False`.**
