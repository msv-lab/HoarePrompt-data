The code snippet `nums.add('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the set `nums`. Since `nums` is initially a set of unique strings, after executing this line, `'0'` will be included in the set. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `N` is an input integer; `nums` is a set of unique strings from the input including `'0'`.**
