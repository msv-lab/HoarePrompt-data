The code snippet `ls += nums[i]` adds the element at index `i` of the list `nums` to the variable `ls`. Given that `ls` was initially 0, `ls` will now hold the value of `nums[i]`. The values of `t`, `N`, and `nums` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the input set of strings and must have at least 1 element, `ls` is `nums[i]`.**
