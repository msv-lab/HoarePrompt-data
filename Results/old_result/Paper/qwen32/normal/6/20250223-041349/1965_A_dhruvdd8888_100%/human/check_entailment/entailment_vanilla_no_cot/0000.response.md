Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The logic used in the program does not align with the rules of the game and the optimal strategy for both players.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the concept of the Nim game and the Nim-sum (XOR-sum) of the pile sizes. The key insight is that the game is equivalent to a Nim game where the winning strategy can be determined by the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is non-zero at the start, Alice (the first player) has a winning strategy. If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob (the second player) has a winning strategy.

Here is a correct implementation based on the Nim-sum concept:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in piles:
        nim_sum ^= pile
    if nim_sum == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")
```

This program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of piles and the sizes of the piles. It calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
