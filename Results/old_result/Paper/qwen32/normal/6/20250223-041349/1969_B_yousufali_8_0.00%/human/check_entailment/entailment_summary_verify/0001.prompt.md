You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads a positive integer `t` from the input, then executes `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value explicitly as per the provided code.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should appear before all '1's) using the minimum total cost. The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring is equal to the length of that substring.

### Key Observations:
1. The optimal strategy is to move all '1's to the end of the string.
2. For every '0' encountered after a '1', we need to perform a cyclic shift to bring that '0' to the front, incurring a cost.
3. The cost of moving a '0' to the front increases with the number of '1's encountered before it.

### Correct Algorithm:
To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string, counting the number of '1's encountered so far (`n`). Each time we encounter a '0' after having encountered at least one '1', we add `n + 1` to the total cost. This is because the substring from the first '1' to the current '0' needs to be cyclically shifted.

### Given Program Analysis:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is supposed to handle a single test case.
- `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Input Handling**: The line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect for reading a binary string. It should be `s = input().strip()` to read the string as is.
2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost based on the given observations. However, due to the incorrect input handling, the function will not work as intended.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in `func_1`, particularly the incorrect input handling, the program cannot be considered correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
