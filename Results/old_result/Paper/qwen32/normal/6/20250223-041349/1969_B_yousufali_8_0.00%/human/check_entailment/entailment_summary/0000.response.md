Reasoning:

The provided problem requires determining the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any substring. The cost of such an operation is equal to the length of the chosen substring.

The given code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. Here is a step-by-step analysis of how these functions work and whether they meet the problem requirements:

1. `func_1`:
   - This function reads a list of integers from the input, which should be a binary string (`0`s and `1`s).
   - It iterates through the list and counts sequences of `1`s, adding the length of each sequence plus one to the answer (`ans`) whenever it encounters a `0` after a sequence of `1`s.
   - The logic behind this approach is that each sequence of `1`s followed by a `0` can be moved to the end of the string by performing cyclic shifts, and the cost for each shift is the length of the sequence of `1`s plus one.

2. `func_2`:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case, effectively processing `t` binary strings as described above.

However, there are a few issues with the provided code that make it incorrect for the problem:

- The function `func_1` reads a list of integers using `input().split()`, which will split the input string by spaces and convert each element to an integer. This is not suitable for reading a binary string directly. Instead, it should read a string and convert it to a list of integers manually or read it as a string and process it directly.
- The logic in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The problem requires finding the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string, which involves more than just counting sequences of `1`s followed by `0`s and adding their lengths plus one.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
