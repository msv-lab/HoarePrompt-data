Reasoning: 
The provided code is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order through cyclic shifts of its substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted. 

Let's analyze the logic of the provided functions:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads a binary string `s` as a list of integers.
   - It initializes `n` to count the number of `1`s encountered and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is `1`, it increments the count `n`.
     - If the character is `0` and `n` (the count of `1`s) is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - The logic behind adding `n + 1` when encountering a `0` after a sequence of `1`s is based on the idea that each `1` before a `0` can be moved to the right of the `0` with a cost of `n + 1` (where `n` is the number of `1`s). This is because the substring from the first `1` up to the current `0` needs to be cyclically shifted.
   - This function prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the respective binary string.

The logic in `func_1` seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost based on the described operation and cost rules. The function correctly identifies sequences of `1`s followed by `0`s and calculates the cost to move those `1`s to the right of the `0`s.

The provided example cases in the problem statement match the expected output based on the logic described. Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
