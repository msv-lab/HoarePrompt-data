Output State: **`s` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 and has at least 1 element; `n` is incremented by 1; `i` is incremented by 1, and it must be less than the length of `s`.**

In simpler terms, the list `s` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is increased by 1. The variable `i` is also increased by 1, and it must still be less than the length of the list `s`.
