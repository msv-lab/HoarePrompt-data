To determine the output, we need to understand the variables and how they are computed based on the initial state provided.

### Initial State:
1. **n**: This is the count of 1s in a list.
2. **ans**: This is the sum of (length of each sequence of 1s + 1) for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0.

### Explanation:
- **n** is straightforward; it simply counts the number of 1s in the list.
- **ans** is a bit more complex. It involves identifying sequences of 1s in the list and then adding 1 to the length of each of these sequences. These modified lengths are then summed up to get the final value of `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example list to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose the list is `[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]`.

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Count of 1s (n)**:
   - The list contains 6 ones.
   - Therefore, `n = 6`.

2. **Sum of (length of each sequence of 1s + 1)**:
   - Identify sequences of 1s followed by a 0:
     - First sequence: `[1, 1]` (length = 2) -> 2 + 1 = 3
     - Second sequence: `[1, 1, 1]` (length = 3) -> 3 + 1 = 4
     - Third sequence: `[1]` (length = 1) -> 1 + 1 = 2
   - Sum these values: 3 + 4 + 2 = 9.
   - Therefore, `ans = 9`.

### General Case:
Given the initial state, `ans` is calculated based on the sequences of 1s in the list, and it is the sum of the lengths of these sequences plus one for each sequence.

### Final Output:
Since the exact list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of (length of each sequence of 1s + 1) for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0)**
