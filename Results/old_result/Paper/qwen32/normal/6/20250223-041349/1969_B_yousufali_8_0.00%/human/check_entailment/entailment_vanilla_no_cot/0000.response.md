Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The `func_1` function is expecting a list of integers separated by spaces, which is not the format of the input as described in the problem. The input is a binary string, not a list of integers.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic in `func_1` does not match the problem requirements. The program is supposed to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts, but the current implementation does not perform any cyclic shifts or consider the cost of such operations. Instead, it incorrectly calculates a value based on the number of 1s and 0s encountered.

3. **Output**: The program does not output the correct minimum cost for each test case. The logic for calculating the cost is entirely wrong and does not align with the problem's requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to implement an algorithm that calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts, which involves more complex logic than what is present in the given program.
