### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided problem, the code, and the function summaries to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Recap:
- The task is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum cost.
- The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring is equal to the length of that substring.
- The optimal strategy involves moving all '1's to the end of the string, and for each '0' encountered after a '1', we perform a cyclic shift to bring that '0' to the front.

#### Key Observations:
- For each '0' encountered after a '1', the cost to bring it to the front is the number of '1's encountered so far plus one.
- The provided function summaries correctly describe the behavior of `func_2` and `func_1`.

#### Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Issue with Input Handling**: The line `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` is incorrect. It attempts to read a line of input, split it by spaces, and convert each part to an integer. This is not suitable for reading a binary string without spaces.
  - **Correct Input Handling**: The correct way to read a binary string is `s = input().strip()`.
  - **Logic**: The logic inside `func_1` for calculating the cost is correct. It counts the number of '1's and adds the appropriate cost whenever a '0' is encountered after a '1'.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - The function summary correctly describes this behavior.

#### Correctness Assessment:
- The primary issue in the program is the incorrect input handling in `func_1`. This issue prevents the program from correctly reading the binary strings and thus results in incorrect outputs.
- Despite the logic for calculating the cost being correct, the incorrect input handling means the program will not function as intended.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in `func_1` related to input handling, the program cannot be considered correct.

**Final: False**
