To provide an accurate output state, we need to know the implementation of the function `func_1()`. Since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code snippet, it is impossible to determine how the variables are affected or if any new variables are introduced.

However, based on the given initial state and the call to `func_1()`, we can assume that the function might modify the variable `t` or introduce new variables. Without the function definition, we can only state that `func_1()` has been executed, and `t`'s value might have changed or new variables could have been introduced.

If we assume that `func_1()` does not modify the state or introduce new variables, the output state would be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer input by the user, such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4. `func_1()` has been executed.**
