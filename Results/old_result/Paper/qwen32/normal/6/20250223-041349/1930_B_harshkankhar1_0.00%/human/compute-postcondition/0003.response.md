Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), which represents the length of a permutation `p`. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the permutation `p`. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
