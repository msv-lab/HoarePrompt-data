Functionality: **The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and creates a permutation `p` of the first `n` natural numbers. It then reverses the elements at even indices of this permutation and prints the resulting list. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
