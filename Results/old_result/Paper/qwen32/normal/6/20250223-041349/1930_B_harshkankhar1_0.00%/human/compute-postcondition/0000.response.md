The code snippet creates a list `a` that contains integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is read from the input. The initial state includes multiple test cases, and for each test case, `n` is specified. The variable `a` is created anew for each test case.

Output State: **The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3) — the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) — the length of the permutation `p`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `a` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n`.**

In natural language: The input consists of multiple test cases, with `t` specifying the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is given, and `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`. The conditions on `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
