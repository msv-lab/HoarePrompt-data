To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is the number of test cases.
2. `n` is the length of the permutation `p`.
3. `a` is a list where the elements at even indices are reversed compared to their initial state.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a)
```

### Analysis:
The list `a` has its elements at even indices reversed. However, the initial state does not specify the initial values of the list `a` or the permutation `p`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `a` without more information. 

However, we can describe the transformation applied to `a` as per the precondition.

### Description:
- The initial list `a` is transformed such that the elements at even indices are reversed.
- The elements at odd indices remain unchanged.

Given this transformation, the output will be the modified list `a` after the described operation.

### Output:
Since the exact initial values of `a` are not provided, we can describe the output as the list `a` with its even-indexed elements reversed.

Output: **a (where the elements at even indices are reversed compared to their initial state)**
