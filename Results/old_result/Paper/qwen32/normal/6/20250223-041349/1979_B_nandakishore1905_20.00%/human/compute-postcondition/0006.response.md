Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`, and `k` is not a power of two. The current value of `n` is 0 and `m` is an odd integer.**

(Note: The if condition `(n == 0 and m % 2 != 0)` cannot be true given the precondition that `n` is an integer greater than 0. Therefore, the postcondition provided is a theoretical description based on the given if condition, while acknowledging the contradiction with the precondition.)
