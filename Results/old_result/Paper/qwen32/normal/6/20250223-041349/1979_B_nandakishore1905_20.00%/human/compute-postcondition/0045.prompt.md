Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers x and y such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and x ≠ y. The number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    k = abs(n - m)
    if k & k - 1 == 0:
        print(k)
    elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
        print(1)
    elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
        print(2)
    else:
        l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
        p = len(l)
        q = 2 ** (p - 1)
        print(k - q)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `m` is an integer greater than 0, and `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then no additional variables are defined. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2, no additional variables are defined. If `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2. If `n == 0` and `m % 2 != 0`, no additional variables are defined. If `n == 0` and `m % 2 == 0`, no additional variables are defined. Otherwise, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `m` are the new input integers; `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the state of `l`, `p`, and `q` remains as described in the precondition. If `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
