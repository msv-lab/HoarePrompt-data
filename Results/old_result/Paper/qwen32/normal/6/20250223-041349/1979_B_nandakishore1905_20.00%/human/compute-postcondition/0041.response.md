Let's break down the initial state and the variables step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Variables Initialization:**
   - `n` and `m` are integers provided as input.
   - `k` is calculated as the absolute value of `n - m`, i.e., `k = abs(n - m)`.
   - `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix. This means `l = bin(k)[2:]`.
   - `p` is the length of the binary string `l`, i.e., `p = len(l)`.
   - `q` is a constant integer with the value 2.

2. **Expression to be Printed:**
   - The expression to be printed is `k - q`.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - We need to determine the value of `k - q`.
   - `k` is `abs(n - m)`, which is a non-negative integer.
   - `q` is a constant value of 2.
   - Therefore, `k - q` will be `abs(n - m) - 2`.

Given the above steps, the output will be the result of the expression `abs(n - m) - 2`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `k - q`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `abs(n - m) - 2`.

Output: **abs(n - m) - 2 (where n and m are the input integers)**
