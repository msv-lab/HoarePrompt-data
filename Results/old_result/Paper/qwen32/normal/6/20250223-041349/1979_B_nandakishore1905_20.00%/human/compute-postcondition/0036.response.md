Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` and `m` are new input integers.
- `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`.
- If `k` is not a power of 2:
  - `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
  - `p` is the length of `l`.
  - `q` is 2.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Explanation:
The `print(1)` statement in the code snippet is independent of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `i`. It simply prints the integer `1`.

### Output:
The code will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
