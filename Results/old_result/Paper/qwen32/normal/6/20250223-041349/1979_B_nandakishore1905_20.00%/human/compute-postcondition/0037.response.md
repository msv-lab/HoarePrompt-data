To determine what will be printed by the `print(2)` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State Summary:
- `n` and `m` are new input integers.
- `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`.
- If `k` is not a power of 2:
  - `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
  - `p` is the length of `l`.
  - `q` is 2.
  - `i` is incremented by 1.
- The `print(2)` statement is independent of the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `i`. It simply prints the integer `2`.

### Analysis:
- The `print(2)` statement directly prints the integer `2`, regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `i`.
- The conditions and computations involving `k`, `l`, `p`, `q`, and `i` do not affect the output of `print(2)`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(2)` statement will output the integer `2`.

### Final Output:
Output: **2**
