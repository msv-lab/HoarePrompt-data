Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the element at index `x` in `l` is greater than `a`. If the element at index `x` in `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to the value of the element at index `x` in `l`, and `a` remains `float('inf')`, `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the value of the element at index `x` in `l`, `b` is set to `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.**
