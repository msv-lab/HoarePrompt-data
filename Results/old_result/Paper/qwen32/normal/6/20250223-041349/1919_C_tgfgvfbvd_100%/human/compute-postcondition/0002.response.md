The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then stores these integers in a list `l`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
