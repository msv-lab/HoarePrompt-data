Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0. Since the condition `a > b` is always false (both `a` and `b` are `float('inf')`), the else part is not executed and the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
