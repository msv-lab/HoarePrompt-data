Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `x + 1`. If `l[x] <= a`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] <= b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `l[x] > b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a` was greater than `b` before any updates, then `a` and `b` are swapped; otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
