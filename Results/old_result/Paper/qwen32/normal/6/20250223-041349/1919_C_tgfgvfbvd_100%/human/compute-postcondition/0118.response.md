Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the array and a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array. It processes multiple test cases, where the total number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 10,000, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 200,000. The function returns a result based on the elements of the array for each test case.**
