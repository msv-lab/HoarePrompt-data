Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is either `float('inf')` or the value of `l[x]` (previous value of `b`), `b` is either `float('inf')` or the value of `l[x]` (previous value of `a`), `c` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. `x` is `x + 1`.**
