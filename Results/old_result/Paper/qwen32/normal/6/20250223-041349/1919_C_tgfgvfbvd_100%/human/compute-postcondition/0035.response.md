Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `x` is `x + 1`. If `l[x] <= b`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If `a` was greater than `b` before the assignment, then `a` is now the previous value of `b` and `b` is now the previous value of `a`; otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `l[x] > b`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a` was greater than `b` before the `a` assignment, then `a` and `b` are swapped as before; otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
