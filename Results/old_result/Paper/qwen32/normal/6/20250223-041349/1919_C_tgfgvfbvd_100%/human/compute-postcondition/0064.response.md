The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The values of `l`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is the value of `l[x]`, `b` is either `float('inf')` or the value of `l[x]` (previous value of `a`), `c` is either 1 or 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. `x` is `x + 1`.**
