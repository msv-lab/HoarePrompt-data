The code snippet `b = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of the list `l` to the variable `b`. Given that `x` is `x + 1` from the initial state, `b` will now hold the value of the element at the new index `x` in the list `l`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0, `x` is `x + 1`, `b` is `l[x]`.**
