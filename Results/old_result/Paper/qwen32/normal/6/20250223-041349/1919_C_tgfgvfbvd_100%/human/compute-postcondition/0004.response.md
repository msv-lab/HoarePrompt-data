The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `c`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0.**
