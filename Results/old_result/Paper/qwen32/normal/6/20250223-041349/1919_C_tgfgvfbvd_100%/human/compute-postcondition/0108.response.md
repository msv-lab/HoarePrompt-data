Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than `x + 1`; `x` is `x + 1`. If `a` was originally greater than `b`, then `a` is set to the original value of `b` and `b` is set to the original value of `a`, and `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] <= b`. If `a` was not greater than `b`, then `a` and `b` retain their original values, and `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] <= b`.**
