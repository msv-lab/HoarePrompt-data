Postcondition: **`l` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than `x + 1`; `x` is `x + 1`. If `l[x] <= b`, then `b` is set to `l[x]` and if `a` was originally greater than `b`, `a` is set to the original value of `b` and `b` is set to the original value of `a`. `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] <= b`. Otherwise, `a` is set to `l[x]` and `c` is incremented by 1.**
