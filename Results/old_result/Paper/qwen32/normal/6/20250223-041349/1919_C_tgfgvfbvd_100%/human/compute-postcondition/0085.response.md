The code snippet swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Given the initial state, `a` was `float('inf')` and `b` was also `float('inf')`. After the swap, `a` will still be `float('inf')` and `b` will still be `float('inf')`. The condition `a` is greater than `b` remains true because both are still `float('inf')`. The other variables (`l`, `c`, and `n`) are not affected by this swap.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from the input; `a` is `float('inf')`; `b` is `float('inf')`; `c` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is greater than `b`.**
