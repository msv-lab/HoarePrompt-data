Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description step by step:

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Splitting the Array**: We need to split the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that every element of the array `a` is either in `s` or `t`.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: For a subsequence `b`, the penalty `p(b)` is the number of indices `i` where `b[i] < b[i + 1]`. The total penalty is `p(s) + p(t)`.
3. **Objective**: Minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program seems to attempt to find the minimum penalty by maintaining two variables `a` and `b` which seem to represent the last elements of the subsequences `s` and `t` respectively. The variable `c` keeps track of the penalty.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:
1. **Initialization**: `a` and `b` are initialized to infinity, and `c` (penalty) is initialized to 0.
2. **Iteration through the array**: For each element `l[x]` in the array:
   - If `a > b`, swap `a` and `b`. This step ensures that `a` is always the smaller of the two.
   - If the current element `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, it is added to the subsequence represented by `a`.
   - Else if `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`, it is added to the subsequence represented by `b`.
   - If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, it is considered to be part of a new increasing sequence, and `a` is updated to `l[x]` while the penalty `c` is incremented by 1.

### Correctness Analysis:
The logic in the program is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the optimal splitting of the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty. The program does not consider all possible ways to split the array and instead tries to maintain a simple condition which is not sufficient for finding the optimal split.

For example, consider the array `[8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]`:
- The program might incorrectly assign elements to `a` and `b` without considering the best possible split to minimize the penalty.
- The optimal split might involve more complex decisions which this program does not account for.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not guarantee the minimum penalty for all possible input cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
