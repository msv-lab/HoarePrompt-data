The code snippet `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. However, the initial state does not specify the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, we can only describe the change in terms of the variables themselves.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than `x + 1`; `x` is `x + 1`; `a` is the previous value of `b`; `b` is the previous value of `a`.**

In natural language, this means that the list `l` and the conditions on `n` and `x` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` have been swapped.
