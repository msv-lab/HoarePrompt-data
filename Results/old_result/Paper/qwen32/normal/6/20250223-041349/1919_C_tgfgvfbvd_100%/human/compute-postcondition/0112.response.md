The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The other variables (`l`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `b`) retain their original values as they are not modified by this line of code.

Output State: **`l` is a list of integers from the input; `n` is greater than `x + 1`; `x` is `x + 1`; `a` is `l[x]`; `b` retains its original value; `c` is incremented by 1.**
