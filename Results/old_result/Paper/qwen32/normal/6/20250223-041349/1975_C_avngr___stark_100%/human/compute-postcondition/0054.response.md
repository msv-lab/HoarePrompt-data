The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to be the integer input provided by the user. This changes the value of `n` from its initial state, which was at least 3, to whatever integer value is input by the user. The other variables `t`, `a`, and `max` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `max` is the maximum value among the second smallest elements of all possible sublists of length 3 in `a`.**
