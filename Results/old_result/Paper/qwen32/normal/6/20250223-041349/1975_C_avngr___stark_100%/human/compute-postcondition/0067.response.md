The code snippet `temp = a[i:i + 3]` slices the list `a` starting from index `i` up to but not including index `i + 3`. This means `temp` will be a sublist of `a` containing three elements, starting from the element at index `i` of `a`.

Given the initial state, `i` has already been incremented by 1, so the slice will start from the element at the current value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, `max`, and the rest of `a` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a new list of integers derived from the latest input, `max` is updated if necessary, `i` is incremented by 1, `temp` is a sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`.**
