Postcondition: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `temp` is a sorted sublist of `a` from index `i` to `i + 3`, `i` retains its original value. If `temp[1] > max`, then `max` is updated to the second element of `temp`. Otherwise, `max` retains its original value.**
