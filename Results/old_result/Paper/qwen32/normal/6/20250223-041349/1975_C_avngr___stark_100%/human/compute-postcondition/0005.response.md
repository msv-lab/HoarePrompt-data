To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(a))` statement, let's break down the information provided in the initial state:

1. `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. However, `t` is not used in the given print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
2. `n` is an input integer with the current value of 2. Again, `n` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for this task.
3. `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

Since the exact contents of the list `a` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value that `min(a)` will produce. However, we can describe the output in terms of the list `a`.

The `min(a)` function will return the smallest integer in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(min(a))` statement will be the smallest integer in the list `a`.

Output: **min(a) (where min(a) is the smallest integer in the list `a`)**
