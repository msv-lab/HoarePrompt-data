Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele`), then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `c`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele` and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and its previous value.**
