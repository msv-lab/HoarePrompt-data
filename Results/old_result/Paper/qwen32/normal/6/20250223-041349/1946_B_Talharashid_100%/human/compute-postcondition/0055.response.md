Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers, `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of `l`, `i` is `len(l) + 1`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
maxi = max(c, maxi)
```

Impact of the code: The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`, `i` is `len(l) + 1`.**

In natural language: After executing the code, `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `c` remains 0 or the sum of the last contiguous subarray of non-negative numbers. The variable `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `c`.
