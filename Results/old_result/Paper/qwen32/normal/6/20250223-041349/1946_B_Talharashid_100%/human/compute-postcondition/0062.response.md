The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, which is an element of the list `l`. For the loop to execute, the list `l` must have at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is not empty. 

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `maxi`, `i`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to control the execution of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to adjust the list `l` to ensure that it has at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is `len(l)`**
