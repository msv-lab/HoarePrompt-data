Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the maximum sum after `k` operations is incorrect. The program attempts to find a maximum subarray sum and then uses it in a formula that does not correctly account for the operations allowed.

To solve this problem, you should consider the following:

1. **Maximum Subarray Sum:** You need to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the given array. This can be done using Kadane's algorithm.
2. **Doubling the Maximum Sum:** Each operation allows you to insert the sum of any subarray anywhere in the array. The optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the maximum subarray sum, effectively doubling it each time.
3. **Modulo Operation:** Since the result can be very large, you need to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The correct approach involves:
- Using Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
- Calculating the final sum by doubling the maximum subarray sum `k` times (which is equivalent to multiplying by \(2^k\)) and adding it to the original sum of the array.
- Taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        max_subarray_sum = float('-inf')
        current_sum = 0
        for num in a:
            current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
            max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, current_sum)
        
        # Calculate the total sum of the array
        total_sum = sum(a)
        
        # The result is (total_sum + max_subarray_sum * (2^k - 1)) % MOD
        # Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: 2^k - 1
        if k == 0:
            result = total_sum % MOD
        else:
            result = (total_sum + max_subarray_sum * (pow(2, k, MOD) - 1)) % MOD
        
        print(result)

func()
```

This program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations and outputs the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
