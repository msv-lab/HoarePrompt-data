The code snippet assigns the value `0` to the variable `c`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the value of `c` is updated to `0`, while all other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in `l`, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`.**
