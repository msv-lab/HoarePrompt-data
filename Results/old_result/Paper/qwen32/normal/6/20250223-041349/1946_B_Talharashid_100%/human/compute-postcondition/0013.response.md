The only object in the loop head is the variable `ele`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If `l` has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `ele` was the last processed element from the list `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have another element. The next `ele` will be the next element in the list `l`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is equal to `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `ele` and 0. `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**
