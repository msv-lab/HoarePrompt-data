The only variable in the loop head is `ele`, which is used to iterate over the elements of the list `l`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the list `l` is not empty for the loop to execute. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `maxi` are not directly related to the execution of the loop and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted such that `l` contains at least one element. Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 1 element; `c` is 0; `maxi` is 0**
