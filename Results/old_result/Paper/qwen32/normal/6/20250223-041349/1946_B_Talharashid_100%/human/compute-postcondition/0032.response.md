The value of `maxi` is explicitly set to 0 by the code. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is the first integer obtained from the input; `k` is the second integer obtained from the input; `l` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `c` is 0; `maxi` is 0; `i` is incremented by 1.**
