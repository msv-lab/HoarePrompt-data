Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele`), then `c` is 0 and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele` and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the previous `maxi`.**
