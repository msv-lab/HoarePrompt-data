The given code snippet updates the `maxi` variable by comparing it with the current value of `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` are not affected by this line of code. The only variable that is updated is `maxi`, which is set to the maximum value between its current value and `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^4, `n` is the first integer obtained from the input, `k` is the second integer obtained from the input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the next element in the list `l` after the current one. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= abs(`ele`), then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `c`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `ele` and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and its previous value. `maxi` is updated to max(`c`, `maxi`).**
