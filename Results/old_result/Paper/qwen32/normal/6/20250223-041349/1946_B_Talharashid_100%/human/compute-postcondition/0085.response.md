To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to understand the purpose of the provided code snippet. The code processes each test case by reading integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of `a` (where the sum is maximized by potentially resetting the sum when encountering a negative number that is large enough to reset the accumulated sum `c` to 0). It then computes a final value based on this maximum sum and prints the result for each test case.

Given the initial state and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the final state after all iterations are completed. Here's the final output state described in the required format:

Output State: **For each test case, the code computes and prints the value `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, where `maxi` is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of `l` and `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in `l`. The variable `i` will be equal to `t`, the total number of test cases.**

In simpler terms, after processing all test cases, the final state is that for each test case, the program has printed the computed result based on the maximum contiguous subarray sum and the total sum of the array elements, and the loop index `i` will have reached the total number of test cases `t`.
