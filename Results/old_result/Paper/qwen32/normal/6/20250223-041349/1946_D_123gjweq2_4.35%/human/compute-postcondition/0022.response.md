To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop's behavior step-by-step and how the variables evolve.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `cur_arr`: A list of non-negative integers.
   - `bit`: An integer such that `0 <= bit < 30`.
   - `new_arr`: An empty list.
   - `xor`: 0.
   - `thing1`: 0.

2. **Loop Iteration:**
   - For each element `i` in `cur_arr`:
     - `xor` is updated to `xor ^ i`.
     - If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0 (`not xor >> bit & 1` evaluates to `True`):
       - `i` is appended to `new_arr`.
       - `xor` is reset to 0.

### Iteration Details

- **First Iteration:**
  - `xor` becomes `0 ^ i1` (where `i1` is the first element of `cur_arr`).
  - If the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0, `xor` is appended to `new_arr` and reset to 0.

- **Subsequent Iterations:**
  - `xor` continues to accumulate XOR results of elements in `cur_arr`.
  - Each time the `bit`-th bit of `xor` becomes 0, `xor` is appended to `new_arr` and reset to 0.

### Final State

- After the loop completes, `xor` will hold the XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` that were not part of any `xor` value that had a 0 at the `bit`-th position when the condition was met.
- `new_arr` will contain all `xor` values that had a 0 at the `bit`-th position when the condition was met.
- `thing1` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.

### Conclusion

The final output state depends on the specific elements in `cur_arr` and the value of `bit`. However, the general state can be described as:

- `cur_arr`: Remains unchanged.
- `bit`: Remains unchanged.
- `new_arr`: Contains all `xor` values that had a 0 at the `bit`-th position when the condition was met.
- `xor`: Holds the final XOR value of elements in `cur_arr` that were not part of any `xor` value that had a 0 at the `bit`-th position when the condition was met.
- `thing1`: Remains 0.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`cur_arr` is unchanged, `bit` is unchanged, `new_arr` contains all `xor` values with the `bit`-th bit as 0, `xor` is the final XOR of remaining elements, `thing1` is 0.**

In simpler terms, `new_arr` will have all the intermediate `xor` values that had a 0 at the specified bit position, and `xor` will be the final XOR of the remaining elements in `cur_arr` that did not meet the condition. `thing1` remains 0 throughout.
