You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (where 0 <= bit < 30) as input. It recursively calculates and returns the maximum value between the length of `cur_arr` and the length of a derived list `new_arr` based on XOR operations and bit checks. If certain conditions are met, it returns the result of a recursive call with a decremented `bit` value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Problem Recap
The task is to find the maximum number of segments \( k \) such that:
1. The segments form a continuous partition of the array \( a \) from index 1 to \( n \).
2. The bitwise OR of the XORs of each segment is less than or equal to a given number \( x \).

### Program Analysis

The given program consists of two functions:
1. `func_1(arr, x)`: This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`. The number 31 is used because the maximum value for \( x \) and each \( a_i \) is less than \( 2^{30} \), and thus, considering up to the 30th bit (0-indexed) is sufficient.
2. `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`: This function recursively tries to partition the array based on the current bit position and checks if the condition is satisfied.

#### Key Points in `find_max`:
- **Base Case**: If `bit == -1`, it means all bits have been considered, and the function returns the length of the current array, indicating that the array can be fully partitioned.
- **XOR Calculation**: The function calculates the cumulative XOR of elements in the array.
- **Partitioning**: If the current bit of the cumulative XOR is 0, it means that the segment can be partitioned at this point, and the XOR is added to `new_arr`.
- **Recursive Calls**:
  - If the current bit of `x` is 1, the function considers both possibilities: partitioning the array at the current bit (using `new_arr`) or not partitioning (using `cur_arr`).
  - If the current bit of `x` is 0, the function only considers the possibility of partitioning if it is valid (i.e., the last segment's XOR does not have the current bit set).

### Correctness Analysis
The program's approach to recursively partition the array based on the bits of \( x \) and the cumulative XOR is conceptually sound. However, there are a few issues:
1. **Handling the Last Segment**: The variable `thing1` is used to handle the case where the last segment's XOR has the current bit set. However, the logic here is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where the last segment cannot be partitioned.
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the array cannot be partitioned at all, which should return -1.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly handle all edge cases and might not always return the correct maximum number of segments \( k \) for all inputs. Specifically, the logic for handling the last segment and ensuring that the partitioning is valid is incorrect.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
