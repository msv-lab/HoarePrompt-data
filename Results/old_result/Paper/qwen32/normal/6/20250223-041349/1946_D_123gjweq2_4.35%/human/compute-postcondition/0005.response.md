The code snippet provided initializes a variable `thing1` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, or `xor`. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.**
