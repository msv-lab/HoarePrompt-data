The code snippet `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the current value of `i`. Given that the initial value of `xor` is 0, the new value of `xor` will simply be the value of `i` because `0 ^ i` is `i`.

The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `new_arr`, `thing1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is either `[5, xor]` or `[xor]` depending on whether the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0 or not, `xor` is `i`, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
