The code appends the value of `xor` to the `new_arr` list. Given that `xor` is 5, `new_arr` will now contain the single element 5. The other variables (`cur_arr`, `bit`, `thing1`) remain unchanged. The condition that `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0 is still valid since the value of `xor` has not changed.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is [5], `xor` is 5, `thing1` is 0, and the `bit`-th bit of `xor` is 0.**
