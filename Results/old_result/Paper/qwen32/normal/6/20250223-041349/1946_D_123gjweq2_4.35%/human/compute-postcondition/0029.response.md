Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.**

In simpler terms, the program calculates the maximum of two values: the result from calling `find_max` with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1`, and the number of elements in `new_arr`. The exact value returned depends on the results of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
