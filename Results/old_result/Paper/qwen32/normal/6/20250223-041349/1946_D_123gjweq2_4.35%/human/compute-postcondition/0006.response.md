The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, which is used to iterate over `cur_arr`. Therefore, the state of `cur_arr` is the only one that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. If `cur_arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0**
