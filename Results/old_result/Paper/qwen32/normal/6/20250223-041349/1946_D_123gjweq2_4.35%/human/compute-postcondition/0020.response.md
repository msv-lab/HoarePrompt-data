The code snippet provided sets the variable `xor` to 0. This change only affects the value of `xor` itself, and does not influence the other variables directly. Therefore, the other variables retain their initial values and states.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is either `[5, xor, xor]` or `[xor, xor]` depending on whether the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0 or not, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.**
