Let's analyze the given state and the for loop statement step by step:

State at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element.
- `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30.
- `new_arr` is either `[5, xor]` or `[xor]` depending on whether the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0 or not.
- `xor` is 0.
- `thing1` is 0.
- `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.

The for loop statement:
```python
for i in cur_arr:
    # the loop body is omit
```

From the loop statement, we can see that the only variable in the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` for the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element processed from `cur_arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `cur_arr` to be processed.

Let's adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` should be the next element in `cur_arr` after the last processed element.

Since we don't have specific information about the elements in `cur_arr` except that it must have at least one element, we'll assume that there is another element to be processed for the loop to continue.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is either `[5, xor]` or `[xor]` depending on whether the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0 or not, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`**.

Since `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`, we can denote it as `cur_arr[1]` assuming `cur_arr` has at least two elements.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is either `[5, xor]` or `[xor]` depending on whether the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0 or not, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, `i` is `cur_arr[1]`**.

However, since the exact value of `i` is not specified and we are only adjusting the state based on the loop head, we can simply state that `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`.

Final State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is either `[5, xor]` or `[xor]` depending on whether the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0 or not, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`**.

Given the constraints and the loop head, the most accurate state we can provide is:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit < 30, `new_arr` is either `[5, xor]` or `[xor]` depending on whether the `bit`-th bit of the original `xor` is 0 or not, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0, `i` is the next element in `cur_arr`**.
